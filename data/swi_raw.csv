97324,"Strengths - thorough lecture slides and resources Weaknesses - this class was not organized well. The grading was incredibly harsh for what would otherwise have been an introductory course to these topics, and the quizzes were worded strangely making it very difficult to gauge what the instructor and TFs wanted from us."
97324,"I think that the grade that a student earns solely depends on which teaching fellow grades the assignments. I often compared my scoring to my classmate's and then the content we wrote about and while the content would be similar, our grades did not match at all. The grading was quite harsh and instruction was unclear, which often resulted in room for interpretation which I would be penalized for in my work. This class was very unorganized and I felt like I never truly understood what we were learning."
97324,Good
97324,"Lectures were disorganized, lecture notes were not helpful"
97324,This course could be improved with more structure in lectures and outside homework assignments. There was little guidance around HW assignments. Many HW assignments are also group projects which can pose challenges of equality in work put in and grades.
97324,The instructor was great
97324,the weakness of this class was the teaching style of the professor. I liked his stories but he did not teach math well.
97324,"The lectures are often very engaging, and the topics are very relatable."
97324,interesting material if you engage with it
97324,"I wish the slides and lectures were more organized, I get the reasoning behind group projects but becomes very difficult when others won't do the work"
97324,"Could be more engaging in lectures, but had well structured assignments"
97324,"This course allowed me to learn a lot of new material and methods without being stressed. Not sure how he did it, but this had to be one of my favorite courses!"
97324,"The strengths of the course were that the assignments were clear. Professor Jaynes made the lecture notes available for students. I enjoyed working with my team on several of the projects, as it facilitated a collaborative working atmosphere. The weaknesses of the course were that the lectures were sometimes a bit confusing. I can't pinpoint exactly why."
97324,Content and projects were really interesting but I feel like grading is very subjective and probably would not reflect your true learning in class because almost your entire grade is based on group projects. So it really depends on how smart and hardworking your group members are.
97324,"Strengths: engaging lectures, Professor availability before and after class as well as in office hours Weaknesses: Lack of clarity regarding regression equations"
97324,Strengths are professor's passion weaknesses are low amount of classes + high # of group assignments
97324,group project are the weakness
97324,"Strengths are the fact that there is no final, which allows for organic learning without the stress of having an exam. I like the way the lecture notes are constructed too, it helped me learn the content once I got home and was able to look through what we went through in lecture."
97324,Strengths: Thorough explanation of various perspectives of current issues Weaknesses: Explanations sometimes a bit hard to understand
97324,This course was very unorganized.
97324,It was very engaging. The homework assignments were thought provoking.
97324,"Syllabus was clear and concise, lectures are always delivered effectively and professor was always very engaging the course."
97324,Strengths was that the teacher made the lectures very interesting. He is an excellent orator. I also really liked how the course material related to real life problems and teaches us ways to quantify it and address it. The summary notes of the lectures were extremely helpful as well.
97324,more engagement with other groups.   The course also focused on only one part of minority in education systems when it was meant to cover more.
97324,I think this course could be improved by no group work as that was often the biggest burden and took time away from the actual content of the course. I think group essays themselves are extremely difficult. I ended up doing all the work for my group.
97324,Great lectures
97324,"I think the lectures were engaging but I did not like the format of the group projects, because it was difficult to coordinate with other members of the group."
97324,I think that I enjoyed the less amount but more higher thinking homework that was assigned I think that at times though the lectures were boring and if there was a way to make it more engaging that would improve the course.
97324,The strengths of this course were that it really had great information on how court cases and certain events shaped the idea of education in America. The weakness was that the grade was a little bit harsh.
97324,Poorly organized lectures seemed to bounce around.
97324,I think a lot of people didn't take it seriously enough and also the group projects were difficult because the work load was incredibly unbalanced
97324,I think the strength are professors jaynes lectures. He is an interesting lecturer and keeps everyone engaged but I think the group assignments are difficult because the groups are assigned and they do not change for the whole semester so it is difficult to keep working with the same people especially if some do not pull their weight as much as others.
97338,"The show is excellent; the content of lectures seemed nearly pointless. Many classes ere cancelled, and there was very little substance in lecture."
97338,strengths: the show is super interesting
97338,Strengths: you get to feel productive about watching TV Weaknesses: there's no real intellectual substance to the course. The Prof pretends it's a social science class but it's not. You're just watching the show.
97338,I think that this course could be a little more organized and go into more depth on the topics discussed. I also think that the social science concepts we learned should have been tied more to the show.
97338,"Better slides, better lectures, better guest speakers, more attention paid to the show, better TAs."
97338,i think the class could have been better organized to connect the topics we learned about more directly with the show. felt like it was 2 different classes when we talked about the show vs when we talked about any other theories
97338,N/a
97338,"None, this class was great"
97338,"Strengths: interesting topics and connections between The Wire and the real world Weaknesses: disorganized syllabi, and lectures that often were tangentially related"
97338,The final paper was so boring and convolutedhonestly a letdown for such an interesting course. I wanted to explore something in a more nuanced/less formulaic way.
97338,"The show was so good. Sometimes the readings felt a little tangential to the show though. Also, my section did not have great discussion."
97338,The strengths are the Professor is very clear and thorough during lecture. The lectures really help to clarify and expand upon the course readings and materials. Professor Harris is also very accessible and charismatic.
97338,"Once again, The Wire is great. I liked my TF and our section  The class is terribly organized. We learn almost nothing of substance and there is little or no reason to go to lecture. And, indeed, even if you did want to go to lecture, 10% of the time you couldn't because it was cancelled. I am actually astonished by how many class sessions were cancelled or not held this year. I have never before taken a course where upwards of 5 class sessions were cancelled and the professor did not even attempt to make them up. But truly, it did not affect the class because we learned absolutely nothing.   This class being allowed to run makes me question the oversight provided by this university."
97338,Inconsistent grading
97338,"I think the concept for this course is incredibly strong, it is wonderful to apply the social science research and reasoning concepts I've learned to this show, and to learn more about Baltimore through this depiction. I do wish we talked about the show itself more, especially in lectures. Lecture content felt a little detached from the content of the show"
97338,"Very well organized syllabus, concepts are explained thoroughly in class"
97338,"This course has a great structure through the show The Wire. The approach to analyzing the show was excellent, as was Professor Harris' teaching and knowledge of the course material. The only area for improvement would probably be in the course readings. Given the time commitment from the show, there were weeks that could have perhaps benefited from one less reading that week."
97338,The show is great. Section was great. Assignments were fair and manageable. Lecture was horrible so obvious that Harris just reads from a reused script and doesnt actively think about the connection of social science to the specific scenes of the show.
97338,"The main way I think this course could be improved is changing the lecture content. It felt like there was a missing link between the lectures and the show. The lectures talked about broad concepts like the War on Drugs, but we never dug into how The Wire depicts the War on Drugs and the ways in which these depictions were accurate or not. It almost felt like The Wire was treated as a documentary demonstrating concepts like the War on Drugs and Mass Incarceration, but of course, the show is a dramatization, so I was always let wondering about how accurately the show reflected real-life dynamics, especially with regards to police department culture. There is so much rich content in The Wire to discuss, so it was disappointing that the lectures did not really engage with the show."
97338,"This class has a lot of weaknesses.  Lectures were incredibly weak and we barely learned anything. We covered the same topics multiple times, and we moved so slowly that it was almost impossible to pay attention. There are so many other topics that we could have covered- there was no reason that we had to talk about so few topics throughout the entire class. Talk about the politics of education and the problems with our modern education system! Talk explicitly about police corruption! We could have covered homelessness and legal protections (or lack thereof) there. We could have tied New Haven city politics into it! There are so many topics that could have been considered related to the Wire. The lectures have no citations that aren't the few assigned readings, and so we get no breadth of knowledge. I hardly know what I even learned. There are so many interesting topics in city politics and so few were even covered.   We should NOT be watching all five seasons of The Wire. Making other seasons optional? Amazing! Cutting filler episodes and having us read summaries or watch summarized episodes on Youtube? Much better? Watching FIVE SEASONS of The Wire means watching 6+ HOURS of TV a week, on top of readings and podcast episodes. I would have rather had that many readings.   The assignments were also poorly designed. The pop quizzes were not enjoyable. I don't even really mind pop quizzes that much! However, they felt POINTLESS. We had one where we had to design a theoretical political science study based on The Wire, which was only difficult because THE WIRE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH GOOD EXAMPLES TO COVER. Any of us could have come up with a million non-Wire related examples. We shouldn't be treated like middle schoolers. This isn't even a complete intro class!! Cover study design in ten minutes and move on- we've understood the scientific method since we were kids. Some other assignments were timed when they really shouldn't have been. They would have been much better when treated like Psets or short essays- give us a due date, but don't rush us to write down whatever we can find in a short period of time. No one enjoys timed essays and few people do good work during them. The final essay was also terrible to write! We had to pick one group of characters from The Wire and explain how two social science topics covered in class would help them achieve a goal. However, we HARDLY COVERED ANY SOCIAL SCIENCE TOPICS IN CLASS THAT WOULD EVEN BE RELEVANT. We even made a list of them in Section and there were VERY, VERY FEW. This made it extremely difficult to create a topic for the essay, and no one I talked to was happy about the essay that they did write. This felt like a high school class in a bad way.   In short, this class would need to be entirely restructured to be an enjoyable, useful course for any students to take."
97338,"Strengths: Interesting topics, interesting class format (framed by a famous tv show), good selection of readings   Weaknesses: High workload (too many episodes per week) made it hard to keep the class engaged, lectures were also unorganized at times"
97338,"The course is generally quite strong. The wire itself is great, and watching the show is made more interesting by thinking about the concepts from class. I thought that lectures were quite good as well, but maybe could have been more engaging. I think that one way this could be improved is if there was a more narrative twist on some of the political science concepts that felt a little bit dry at times."
97338,"I would say that one of the weaknesses of this course is that we have so many readings to complete on top of watching 4-5 hour long episodes while attending lecture and discussion. It would be better if maybe there was 1 reading that was assigned per lesson because we have to write summaries of each episode and lead a discussion. Since watching the show alone is such a time commitment itself, I wish there was a way to even things out more."
97338,"Strengths: The Wire is a phenomenal show and the final essay encourages students to think deeply about the themes in the show and relate them to social science concepts.  Weaknesses: The structure of the class and lectures. I found that the lectures often summarized the events from the show and the readings, which took away from time where we could discuss the social science concepts and disincentivized students from doing the work outside of class. With this additional time, the lectures could have talked about a new application of the topics from the readings or show. A few ideas I had would be to discuss events from the Wire that happened in real life in Baltimore or other cities, how national policy intersects with local policy, what factors determine childrens outcomes, the history of drug organizations, media standards and the changing role of the media, and how the War on Drugs has impacted U.S. policy internationally."
97338,"Strengths: the show is amazing Id recommend it regardless of whether you take the class  Weaknesses: the lectures are somewhat boring, redundant, and unhelpful"
97338,"The show is very interesting, and I liked watching TV for my homework. The midterm and the final were very reasonable, and my section really helped clarify concepts. At times, the readings and episodes combined were a little overwhelming. Lectures are easy to follow."
97338,"A strength of the course is how academic material is introduced through the show which makes it more engaging. The course could be improved by having the class and sections meet more regularly which would have made me feel more engaged with it. Sometimes, we moved through units quickly and it would have been nice to think about some material more in-depth."
97338,"Its a little hard to keep up with the episodes if you fall behind, but Professor Harris is a gem!"
97338,"Weaknesses: Lots of homework, unannounced quizzes, easy to fall behind, long final essay Strengths: Easy/straightforward midterm, two unannounced quizzes dropped, you'll likely know a good amount of people taking the course"
97338,The course was great there were no weaknesses and everything was reasonable.
97338,"I thought that there were too many readings/episodes assigned per class which often lefts students (I talked to many) picking between either watching the show or doing the readings. I think that if the work per day was more feasible, there would have been higher levels of engagement."
97338,"Strong course throughout, good show, readings werent too dull."
97351,I loved this class! Professor Roberts is an amazing lecturer.
97351,This course is very forgiving and understanding. Everyone treats each other how they desire. It is completely designed to allow students to succeed.
97351,"This course was wonderful! Professor Roberts is so kind and a great lecture, and all of the teaching fellows were amazing."
97351,n/a impossible
97351,"This course was everything that people say a really unflinching look at American history that makes some really powerful connections to the present. Even for people who know a good amount about racism, slavery, and health care, the course is still a valuable way to synthesize all of the information in a new light. I found the readings to be very helpful and relevant and appreciated the course's focus on learning, not grades.   My only complaint is that the course often ran over time and the lectures often seemed geared towards a longer time period than the 50 minutes allotted."
97351,"In this class, you're a person before you're a student. It's understood that students should prioritize sleep and their own well-being. This should be the default for ALL Yale classes, not something unique to this one."
97351,Professor Roberts is one of the most engaging lecturers I have had at Yale. Every lecture was extremely meaningful and informative. I think this is a course that everyone should take before graduating. I truly have no suggestions for improvements for this course.
97351,overall good
97351,Engaging professor
97351,"This course was amazing. Professor Roberts is a brilliant lecturer and incredible person. Each lecture was shocking, disturbing, and so engaging. Professor Roberts sturctures this course to facilitate true learning instead of memorization which is very refreshing."
97351,"strength - professor and TFs and all the extra resources and events to get involved in weaknesses - people could get by in the class without coming to class or engaging in any of the material at all, but again its also a strength of the class that students get to choose their level of engagement based on what other things they have going on in their lives"
97351,"No weaknesses! Overall, a great course that I think every Yale student should take-- we need more classes like this that discuss these important issues that are not talked about"
97351,"I loved the professor but I think that this course could have been more accessible. I think that having lectures recorded is extremely helpful, especially if I needed to miss a class for certain reasons and did not have anyone to provide me notes."
97351,"strengths: engaging and thoughtful professor who cares so deeply about the material and the students. every lecture feels like a gripping movie, material and readings are fascinating without being overwhelming  weakness: sometimes feel like we missed important material or lectures felt a little short"
97351,"Strength - amazing content, Professor Roberts gives great lectures, if you do the assignments you will be okay, TAs are really nice and helpful, and the assignments are spaced out perfectly. Weaknesses - there's not a lot of grade transparency throughout the course in terms of what is completed/ what is for a grade."
97351,"Strengths: The course creates a good family. The course also teaches things that are rarely taught in school. Professor Roberts is one of the sweetest women to walk the planet Earth, and she was a real highlight of the course.  Weakness: The guest lectures were really hit or miss. The lecture given by Dr. Amanda Calhoun was very divisive and added very little to the context of the course. Her language was hostile, and I simply was not a fan of her lecture (or her mini-lecture at the beginning of the course). The other guest lecturers were great! However, I wish Professor Roberts just taught every class."
97351,There were no weaknesses to this course.
97351,honestly... cant think of any weaknesses. Was such a great class.
97351,"There are absolutely no weaknesses. This course is structured beautifully, and Dr. Roberts was one of the best professors I have had at Yale."
97351,"honestly it was so good, i loved the personal stories that were shared throughtout"
97351,"Strengths: - Dr. Roberts is such a caring, intelligent, sweet professor, and she really cultivated a community of care and love in the teaching fellows as well as among the students - The assignments all felt purposeful, and I liked the freedom to explore the topics that most interested me - I also loved the guest speakers and how we got to hear a range of voices and experiences!  - I appreciated that the emphasis of the class was on learning and discussing the material, not on earning a grade -- I think that this fostered more interesting conversations and allowed me to fully jump into topics that were most engaging to me Weaknesses: - Sometimes the lectures seemed to lack a chronological structure throughout the course of the year, and I would've liked a bit more of a clear roadmap throughout history  - It was also sometimes hard to listen to the material of the class, which makes sense, and it is important to hear it even if it is hard. But I would've appreciated a greater emphasis on the questions ""what can I do with this information? what not? how can I apply these lessons in my personal life?"" earlier in the semester -- we got to them eventually, but the first half of the semester was often disheartening in that regard"
97351,Major strengths included the community this course created. I always looked forward to going to lecture and section and this was because of how Professor Roberts was so engaging and truly cares about all of her students and teaching fellows. I also appreciated the structure of the course.
97351,Strengths: Incredibly engaging lectures and discussion sections. Weaknesses: No real weaknesses I wish the lectures were longer they flew by and I wanted to know more.
97351,"Strengths: Prof Roberts and her teaching staff, organization of course projects and respect for students' mental healths, phenomenal lectures (Roberts and guest lectures). Weaknesses: none"
97351,"Weaknesses: none Strengths: excellent professor, content was incredibly relevant, engaging, as were the readings. TFs were equally engaging, and the discussion sections truly did lead to (non-forceful) discussion, unlike many sections I've had in other courses."
97351,"This course is perfect - from its emphasis on student learning as opposed to perfection to its focus on Black health disparities and their historical roots, there is nothing I would change."
97351,"This class is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Each lecture and Weekly Missive were written with care, compassion, and passion. I was inspired to learn every week. The format of the lectures were incredibly engaging and the PowerPoint notes were very helpful at orienting students. I cannot think of anything that can be improved."
97351,"Strengths: Professor Roberts is the most amazing instructor I'll ever have at Yale, lectures were very engaging, interesting, and well-taught, the TF's were the most amazing people, Prof. Roberts did an amazing job handling sensitive material, and this class is truly the best learning experience I could have had at Yale. Weaknesses: none!"
97351,"This class was amazing, and I would not change anything (other than maybe shortening the length of the Monday Missives). Even though it was a large class size, there was a solid sense of community. I looked forward to coming to lecture every week and found the readings to be extremely interesting and engaging. Sometimes at Yale, it can be easy to feel like what you are learning isn't applicable outside of the classroom. However, everything that I learned in this class will affect my life going forward."
97351,Everything about this class is perfect. Nothing about this course could be improved. I only wish there was more.
97351,"Only strengths. Great guest lectures. Great contextualization of African American health throughout history and hopefully looking toward solutions for the future.   No weaknesses. But 50 minutes was often too short for this amazing class. There should also be no enrollment cap if possible. Everyone needs to take this course, it's so important."
97351,"The only weakness that this course has is that there is only one Professor Roberts and that she is constrained to 2x a week 50-minute lectures. I could listen to her lecture for eons. Her background in theater gives the some of the absolute best lectures I have ever had.   The strengths include (but are not limited to): her pedagogy and outlook on student participation, which requires students to set their own goals and grade themselves, her ability to engage a giant lecture hall, her weekly Missives that literally are half the length of a senior thesis, her kindness and compassion, and her syllabus. I have never seen a more beautiful and all-encompassing thesis."
97351,Strengths: Professor Roberts and the TAs. They worked hard to create an open and welcoming classroom environment as well as foster academic and personal growth inside and outside the classroom.
97351,"This was an amazing course. I lecture slides were very organized and understandable, they were easy to follow as Professor Roberts took her students on a journey through history. The lectures were deeply engaging, I never felt bored and I wished they were longer so that Professor Roberts could fit all of her information in! She held the attention of her audience so well and for so long. When Professor Roberts paused you could hear a pin drop in the room. I loved the guest speakers that professor Roberts brought in, it was so interesting and inspiring to hear what other medical professionals are doing with this important history. Each Teaching Assistant was so passionate and deeply engaged in the course content. This made discussion sections engaging and important as the TAs helped their students digest this heavy information."
97351,"There are no weaknessesonly strengths. Amazing lecture topics, amazing professor, and amazing TFs."
97351,Dr Roberts innovative teaching style helps students learn in a way that is engaging and the content is digestible. This course truly changed my outlook on so many aspects of society specifically discrimination in medicine. I cannot think of a way this class could be improved. Only that it would be great if it was taught every semester.
97351,"There are so many strengths of this course: Professor Roberts' care and compassion, her lecturing style (literally the best lecturer at Yale), the assignments that gave us the flexibility to pursue our interests related to the course, etc. The only weakness that comes to mind is the reflection component of the course. We wrote three participation reflections, a final project proposal, and a cover page reflection on our final project. While I totally understand and agree with these assignments, I sometimes felt like I was being a little repetitive simply because there were a lot of opportunities for written reflection. I wonder if there is another way to get to the core of this assignment because I do feel like the reflection component is very importantmaybe instead of a written reflection at the midterm, future students can meet with their teaching fellows and talk through their participation goals in a more casual format (I'm not sure this is possible given how large the class was this semesterbut just a thought). Or maybe instead of writing a final reflection and a final project reflection, future students can combine those assignments into one? I'm not sure. This is obviously a super small weakness that didn't whatsoever take any joy out of the class."
97351,"All strengths, no weaknesses."
97351,"This course was nothing but strength. All STEM majors should this course. It truly dives into the dichotomy that STEM, specifically medicine, have with political and social views. Not only does this class help people better understand the issues that Black people haves faced and still face in America, but it challenges each and every lecture attendee to reshape their perspective on racial and social issues regarding medicine and in the general social sense."
97351,"Strengths: The teaching team - Professor Roberts and the TFs - are so, so wonderful and very clearly care about you as a human being first and foremost. Professor Roberts is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. I think the fact that I willingly made the trek up to Marsh every lecture is very telling. Must take! Weakness: I think that having class in a lecture hall closer to central campus would help make it more accessible!"
97351,"Very good set up. There were assignments, but the focus of the course was to be engaged, and show up to lecture. Less pressure on assignment grades helped me stay more focused with the course, and enjoy it and learn!"
97351,No weaknesses. This is a great course!
97351,Strengths the most interesting and engaging class I have taken at Yale.
97351,"strengths: professor roberts is the best person on earth weakness: literally none, this class is perfect"
97351,"Prof. Roberts is an amazing lecturer, her TF team is great, and the readings are incredibly eye opening."
97351,"stengths -- an amazing lecture, engaged audience, emphasis on student learning rather than grade  weakness -- sometimes information is hard to find in the comprehensive Monday missives (maybe separating assignments and readings into two different emails)"
97351,Roberts and the TFs are wonderful and caring. They know the material very well and are able to communicate it clearly. All the assignments being pass/fail with an option to resubmit was also a way to compel students to engage with the course in a low-pressure way.
97351,"The course embodied the spirit of love, compassion, and intentionality. Professor Roberts and the entire teaching team brought so much care to the class and I would not change a thing about it."
97351,Great staff and focus on introspection. Really feel like I grew this semester.
97351,"This course is the most powerful class I've taken at Yale. The class is so well structured, and the content is so important. Every student should have to take this class."
97351,"Professor Roberts and the teaching staff are some of the biggest strengths of the course. They all care deeply about each student's learning and personal growth throughout the course. I wish we had deeper discussions during section about the topic of the week or the readings. Additionally, I wish there was more of an opportunity for direct engagement with course material during discussion section, but overall there is not much I would change about the course."
97351,This course is excellent.
97351,"This course is incredible! Every assignment except for your final exam is graded Complete/Incomplete to encourage a healthy relationship with coursework and the investment of good faith effort without stress over grades. I love how this lowered the barrier to entry to a course that teaches such important material. Despite this being the biggest class at Yale College, there were multiple support systems in place to support students in their learning and in their lives. The lectures were amazing, and the assignments felt worthwhile (if anything, I think the lesson plan felt a bit out of place and wish we had been able to write the op-ed instead, although I know that was an unforeseen circumstance). I only wish this counted for the MCDB major to encourage more pre-med students to take this fantastic course!"
97351,"Strengths: It's really well-balanced! Lectures were related to the readings, but never delved into them, expecting students to do the readings which would supplement the lecture. There was a lot of time spent on self-reflection and introspection, which meant there was always time to think about what students wanted from the course. Assignments were well-devisedone essay on a close, critical reading of any one of the readings; an op-ed (which got canceled, but I still thought was really cool); and a final project, which could be anything!   Weaknesses: I can't think of any!"
97351,The class was phenomenal and structured for you to get what you want to and need to out of it! It was a very transformative and engaging class! I have very rarely been in a class where I felt I have had the full ownership and agency to apply and learn the material in a way I find useful and applicable to my discipline and knowledge. And I appreciate how in this class I have been able to do that with the final project and the lesson plan assignments. And Prof. Roberts does an amazing job of getting you to reflect and find meaning int what we are learning!! Absolutely amazing!! I loved it very very much!!
97351,This course was great. Professor Roberts' lectures were very engaging. I also appreciated the guest lectures.
97351,The strengths of course were the teaching team and Professor Roberts. All of these individuals contributed to a unique and unforgettable course experience. They were understanding and provided guidance if needed. There were no weaknesses of the course.
97351,This course is exceptional because of the amazing work Professor Roberts has done; her investment to the course was incredible. The course also had insightful readings and assignments that encouraged students to pursue their interests.
97351,"Strengths: All of the topics covered, the professor, the TAs, the focus on learning rather than achieving a grade."
97351,I thought the lectures were extremely engaging I just sometimes wished they were longer.
97351,The strengths is how well-rounded the curricula and content was. We learned about so much in so many different areas. The weakness was that sometimes I feel we didnt do enough critical work.
97351,"Strengths - Professor Roberts is the best Professor Ive had at Yale. She is everything that makes this class so wonderful - brilliant, funny, and deeply compassionate toward her students.   Weaknesses - this class is known for giving all students an A. While it was a well-intentioned effort to eliminate student worries about grades, this meant that many people in the class skipped the required readings, treated attendance at lecture as optional, and sometimes failed to complete their discussion section assignments/posts. This is not a class where a lenient grading system should be so wrongfully abused. The lecture and reading material is too important and I feel it didnt get the respect from all 500+ students in this class that it deserved this semester. By proxy, I felt that Professor Roberts did not receive the respect as an educator that she deserved. I fear students took advantage of her compassion and care with the grading policy."
97351,Very good lectures and learning space
97351,This course was taught incredibly well and was deeply engaging. The only way I would say to improve it would be to have more specific questions to respond to in the discussion posts to facilitate more focused conversations in section.
97351,"strengths:  - lectures were absolutely incredibly delivered and very well organized  - environment was positive and fostered student care and success - professor did a great job of placing the material within its proper historical context and drawing out connections between the past and the present  weakness:  - while the technological issues were very endearing, they sometimes unfortunately did take away valuable class time. I think Professor Roberts may want to consider having one of the TAs serve as a technology assistant for this class"
97351,The TF system was very nice to have and constantly checking in.
97351,Dr. Roberts is an amazing lecturer! Every class felt like a TedTalk and was intellectually engaging.
97351,"strengths - great teacher, content that everyone should know, class community weaknesses - none"
97351,wonderful lectures and fascinating readings. lots of creative freedom
97351,"The strengths of this course are definitely the lectures. Professor Roberts is wonderful. Although I wish she had delivered the material with a slightly heavier hand and faster pace, I found them engaging and informative. The readings were absolutely perfect. They were not too long and supported the lectures. One suggestion I would make would be to remove the grading system. I understand the intent, how very, I think the idea of a guaranteed a created an environment among the students that caused them to take the class less seriously. With such serious course material, I feel like student engagement should be of the utmost importance, and I think the grading did not support that."
97351,"Professor Roberts is an amazing lecturer; super caring and incredibly knowledgeable about the subject. Personally, I found the first half of the semester, when we focused more on history, more engaging than the lectures about the modern healthcare system -- maybe because I was less familiar with the historical material."
97351,"This course was fantastic! The professor covered so much meaningful content in each lecture and the course was well organized to facilitate student learning. Our discussion posts and assignments throughout the year allowed us to critically engage with the course material and produce work that was meaningful to us. From the essays to the projects, I really felt that each assignment allowed me to dive deeper into the course material and learn about so many interesting aspects of race and medicine."
97351,"Professor Roberts is an extremely engaging professor and the way she handled our course material was very admirable. I think something can definitely be said about the fact that she was consistently able to keep the attention of a packed Marsh Lecture Hall. Personally, I do not feel that this course has any notable weaknesses."
97351,Carolyn Roberts is the best teacher on this campus. There is really nothing that I would say needs to be improved about this course. It is amazing.
97351,"Strengths: Compassionate, thoughtful professor who truly cares about her students' wellbeing, as shown by the lengthy weekly missives and abundance of readings (and supplemental readings) available for discussion. Weaknesses: Some of the readings and lectures felt repetitive, as it wasn't clear why very related topics (for instance, on reproductive justice) were disconnected into different lectures."
97351,Excellent class with incredible course staff
97351,"The strengths of this course lie in the professor. Professor Roberts is so knowledgeable, caring, and approachable. She cares about all of her students and make an effort to get to know each and every one of them. The way she communicates the material is another strength of this course. It's a shame that the university is not allowing Prof. Roberts to flourish in who she really is."
97351,"Strengths: interesting course content, caring Professor and course staff  Weaknesses: feeds into performative woke culture at Yale in a way that, at times, gets in the way of the work its trying to do"
97351,"There literally are no weaknesses to this course at all. The way the course is structured, it allows you to set your own goals that you wish to aspire towards during the semester and do the course on your own terms. Obviously, it is crucial that you adhere to the good faith effort policy, which really brings the course together in my opinion, and facilitates a productive and supportive learning opportunity."
97351,"A must take! Recordings of the class could have been provided upon requests for accessibility needs. That was one thing the course was lacking, even given the want for people to come in person. I think thats still important."
97351,This was easily one of the best classes I have ever taken. Professor Roberts is one of a kind and an amazing educator and person. There was no weakness at all.
97351,"This course only had strengths. The lectures were engaging and easy to follow, the professor was amazing, the TFs were amazing, and the assignments were interesting. This course also created a wonderful community, and students were valued as their full selves. The course content is necessary for all undergraduates to engage with."
97351,"Strengths: Professor Roberts is an incredible lecturer, professor, human being, etc. I really enjoyed how the course was structured, encouraging us to be conscious of how we could be show up for ourselves."
97351,"I like the support systems in the class, and how the staff put in efforts to make everyone feel loved and cared for."
97351,"It was an amazing class, but probably meant more for people who dont experience what is taught in the course in their daily lives"
97351,"Strengths: Dr. Roberts is an amazing lecturer, the course is interesting, the topics are important, everything is amazing"
97351,"Strengths: clearly outlined readings, TAs were amazing, low academic pressure (emphasis was on what you were learning), knowledgeable guest lecturers Weaknesses: sometimes felt the course was too passive"
97351,"Strengths -- Flexible assignments (so as to maximize meaningfulness to students), good balance of breadth and depth, incredible teaching team  Weaknesses -- None!"
97351,"I loved loved loved this course. So interesting, we covered a plethora of difficult subjects and delved into niche yet so important conversations."
97351,"I honestly cant think of any weaknesses. This course was so well thought out. The lectures are so engaging that I never felt the time pass, and the readings were carefully explained each week and it was clear that all of the assignments had a specific objective related to the class."
97351,"This course is an absolute must-take. The lectures are fascinating, sections enlightening and well structured, and Dr. Roberts is an absolute gem of an educator. Assignments feel purposeful instead of the busy work we often get in other classes. To be honest, I have no notes."
97351,"Lectures were highly engaging and thought provoking, section was good"
97351,"This course is AMAZING. PLEASE TAKE IT. In a sense, this course is its own small experiment. Professor Roberts uniquely grades according to good faith effort, meaning that the course is specifically designed to increase presence and intentionality while reducing unnecessary anxiety and mindless note-taking. Given that every concept discussed is deeply heavy, a flexible, effort-based grading system allows students to process the material in whatever way is best for them, and many different formats for assignments are encouraged."
97351,"No weaknesses at all! Everything about this course was PHENOMENAL. An amazing course by wonderful professor, TAs, and guest lecturers who created a safe and welcoming community to learn about difficult topics. The readings are carefully curated each week and supplement the lectures beautifully. Sections with TAs provide a small group discussion section and circles of care that are inviting and comfortable spaces to speak up in. The TAs provide very thorough feedback on each assignment and it is clear that they went over the project in great detail. Professor Roberts holds all day office hours which is a great resource to chat with her about anything at all."
97351,"Strengths: incredible professor with engaging lectures, support from TFs, and interesting readings Weaknesses: I wish we had discussed the readings during lecture as well to give them context; also, I wish discussion sections had focused on readings or course material rather than exclusively discussing our personal experiences and opinions (although also important)."
97351,"This course provided very important information about African-American history that everyone should know. Also, the learning process was prioritized over giving students busy work or making them stressed about grading, which was a valuable experience, considering the serious subject matter. The course covered a wide range of material and at times felt rushed because there was not enough time to deeply dive in to everything covered."
97351,"I think this course is incredibly strong and focuses on student learning over grades and exams. This was one of the sections that I felt students most engaged with during my time at Yale -- since we were free to explore what we were most interested in, we were more willing to discuss and engage with other stuednts."
97351,"Strengths: the incredible pedagogy of Dr. Carolyn Roberts, and the way she worked with TFs to craft sections. The section for this course was one I looked forward to.  Weakness: This class should be longer!!! I often found that moving at the pace we did did not give us enough time to process the material of the course, and I would have loved more time in class."
97351,Only strengths! Professor Roberts is a wonderful professor and taught a great course.
97351,"A big strength of this course was Professor Roberts. She was so engaging and you could tell that she put a lot of effort into this class (for example, by creating an incredibly detailed reading list and sending out weekly missives to help students know what to expect for the week. Additionally, I felt that the assignments were interesting, engaging, and allowed students to explore topics of interest on their own. The only weakness I noticed was that although the readings were interesting, they were not really emphasized in either lecture or my discussion section and I wish I had gotten to discuss them in more depth, especially considering how much time it took me to keep up with the reading schedule."
97351,"Excellent course, only strengths."
97351,"Strengths: Professor Roberts and the TFs are all so kind Material presented in a straightforward, un-sugarcoated way"
97351,"This course is amazing! My favorite part about it was the structure of grading and assignments, which gives students room to be very creative and take their own path. The level of trust between the instructor and the students was really awesome to experience, and it encouraged me to do my best."
97351,The course fosters creative thinking and personal engagement. There are no weaknesses!
97351,"This course was quite strong in that it really helped facilitate learning of difficult topics over stressing students over studying these topics. In this way, I think students were a lot more engaged in taking in information."
97351,The content was the strength of this class. Very interesting. The weakness was the flexibility to not come to class or do work.
97351,Best Professor ever
97351,Could benefit from a longer lecture period. 50 mins seemed to be too short to cover all material.
97351,A strength was that the lectures were amazing. A weakness was that we didn't always get to finish the lectures so there was some content we didn't get to.
97351,"strenghts: i loved the classroom community and culture and how much freedom we had to explore our own interests. also, the material was very interesting and engaging and presented in a very respectful manner. no weaknesses"
97351,Strengths: Supplemental readings to give further context to lectures. Weaknesses: Not much feedback on individual assignments.
97351,Literally an amazing course can't be improved
97351,Strengths: professor Roberts is fantastic. Weaknesses: cant think of any.
97351,"I think that the class does a great job of making everyone feel included, and professor Roberts really does a fantastic job at trying to engage the large lecture. Nevertheless, I think that the weakness of the course is that the large lecture can often feel less engaging due to the sheer numbers."
97351,"The strengths of this course are the selection of guest speakers and selection of readings to supplement the topics. lectures were information heavy, and fast paced, so the readings always gave me the chance to place myself into a vacuum and closely read about a particular idea, story, or subject. The guest speakers were a wonderful addition to the class, since we learned from people who are doing the work that corrects the wrongs of the history we learn about in the class. It shows us that there are forces of justice."
97351,I think discussion sections shouldnt be a mandatory part of the course. but that is the only weakness I see.
97351,"Strength: I loved Professor Roberts. The history although filled with brutality and violence revealed the racist structures around me. Professor Roberts when teaching these violent events, teaches with care and in a deliberate manner. The readings contributed to completely changing my view of the world.  Weakness: this course was too short. After finishing this course, I feel that there are still significant historical gaps that must be addressed. It would be nice if this course was longer."
97351,This course was AMAZING! Professor Roberts is so kind and wonderful. We need to keep this course forever.
97351,Incredible lectures and professor
97351,"more community events, felt it was hard to find community"
97351,This class was very well-structured and had many different entry points to learning for its students. The readings were always very engaging and the assignments provided flexibility to the students to come to the material in the way they wanted to approach it. The class is truly designed for a variety of majors/interests.
97351,Fantastic Professor who truly cares about the subject matter and gets every student to be interested too.
97351,I think this course is so strong in that it emphasizes self care and it allows you to decide how best you learn
97351,Everything about it was amazing
97351,"Strengths: Professor Roberts is one of the best lecturers I have ever heard. The course content is not only interesting, but vital to know as any human in society. The course culture is very supportive. No weaknesses."
97351,"This course was great, I think it would be better served by longer class periods, with such a large class, it took a significant amount of time at the beginning of class for people to settle down and it felt like we lost out on time for the lecture."
97351,PROF ROBERTS AND HER TEAM are a must take at Yale. The course material is heavy yet engaging. FAVORITE class at Yale.
97351,"I thought this course was strong, and I appreciated the TFs and Professor Roberts' support and flexibility throughout."
97351,"no weaknesses!! I loved how much care Professor Roberts put into each class and her monday missives that explained what readings we will have during the week. This class was focused on just learning, which didn't make it stressful and made the assignments more enjoyable."
97351,Strengths; Great teachers and guest speakers Weakness: Not much to hold students accountable
97351,"The class was really amazing and helps students gain a new perspective on activism and healing. I absolutely loved taking this course. Not only were the lectures great, but the guest lectures really brought everything we learned together."
97351,"No weaknesses! Professor Roberts is truly the most caring, compassionate, and engaging professor I have had at Yale. Every person both at Yale and outside of it should take this course, both to engage with such important content and to learn from such a wonderful instructor. Professor Roberts carefully curated this course in both content and structure to emphasize community building and personal growth."
97351,No weaknesses
97351,"There were only strengths and no weaknesses to this course. The lectures, all of the readings, Professor Roberts, the TAs... everything about this course was amazing."
97351,"the assignments in this course were really meaningful. I think I would have appreciated a little bit more discussion of how these issues are playing out in the present day (I assumed we'd talk about health disparities with COVID, etc.). but understand the history is also very important"
97351,"The biggest strength of this course is that the workload is very light as the focus is on your engagement in the class, not your performance. You dont constantly have to worry about taking what you learn and applying it to specific assignments that are harshly graded. Instead, you have a lot of freedom with your assignments which allows you to engage in this class however you want. There are no weaknesses!"
97351,"Strengths - AMAZING professor and AMAZING TFs. Community events (please take advantage of these, though I wasn't able to). Student-driven assignments. And of course, what we unlearned and learned."
97351,loved everything about it
97351,I believe this course should be mandated to all students.
97351,"The course is structured very well. However, the discussion section could be made to be more engaging."
97351,"This course was phenomenal. Professor Roberts curated lessons that were meaningful, detailed and highly relevant. All strengths and no weaknesses."
97351,"Strengths: the course was a welcoming environment for everyone regardless of background or familiarity with the content, and covered important and upsetting topics in a way that was considerate, gentle, and caring."
97351,"Everything about this class is perfect. This is the most well-organized, rewarding, and interesting course I have ever taken at Yale."
97351,"This course is definitely one of the most unique I have taken at Yale. Professor Robert's and the teaching staff's approach to learning is based on love and care, and I really appreciated that. Professor Roberts truly cares deeply about what she's doing, and that comes across in her engaging lectures. I can't think of any weaknesses of this course."
97351,I think it was a great class! All Id be concerned about is guaranteeing that people put effort into the course!
97351,"The greatest strength of this course is Professor Roberts. This course simply could not be taught with as much depth or compassion and thoughtfulness without her. The only weakness is that some people did not take this class for the right reasons, which made section difficult for those of us invested in the material."
97351,"The course was enriching and compelling unlike any other course I have taken at the university. Professor Roberts' content challenged her students to think critically and challenge their understandings of not just the healthcare system, but the current sociopolitical culture that creates inequities today. The course compels students to imagine greater inclusivity and belonging."
97381,"Prof Blight is a very engaging lecturer, but time management quite honestly was a consistent inhibitor to him covering all the content. Perhaps making it a 1h15m lecture or 3/week."
97381,"The essay prompts are an unfortunate combination of long and vague. They ask many (extremely broad) questions with the expectation of a 5-page response. I think it's crazy to ask 'why did the Confederacy lose the war' as only part of a much longer question, and expect a sharp essay which touches on all relevant points. I wish there were more prompts, but that they were briefer and less vague. The strengths were many: the readings were excellent, the lectures exciting, and the section honestly enlightening."
97381,"Interesting lectures, great TF (Daniel)"
97381,"Too much reading. Exceedingly difficult, even impossible, to keep up with weekly readings in excess of 300 pages. Little relevance to lectures, which were idiosyncratic and unpredictable, if entertaining."
97381,The content of the course is taught in an extremely interesting and engaging way.
97381,Professor Blight is one of the most passionate lecturers I ever had. His verve will inspire you.
97381,"The strengths and weaknesses are both David Blight. He's a cute old man professor that will tell you the best Civil War bedtime stories and have great takes on the world around him but the lecture is mostly bedtime stories and hot takes. As far as the assignments go, I liked the final -- the review sheet is large but if you have a good grasp of the review sheet there will be no surprises -- but Blight's prompts tend to be massive questions (""Who caused the Civil War?"" or ""Is the Civil War an example of progress?"") that are impossible to answer within the pages you get. I thought the key was to pick a lane and support it with the evidence you have and don't worry you're not coming close to an exhaustive essay, but most people seemed to dislike the prompts."
97381,"Blight is a really great professor, though I thought his lectures could be a bit hard to follow at times. The storytelling he weaves in is so interesting, but ultimately can distract from the lectures main argument. Too much reading!!"
97381,Professor Blight without a doubt. His lectures were amazing.
97381,"Strengths: Excellent lecturer with extremely engaging stories - you'll not find a better lecture series on campus. A sense of the human cost and contribution of the war. Structured sections with activities fill in content gaps and clarify timeline/concepts.  Weaknesses: A LOT of reading is assigned - very interesting but not feasible to finish within the week; it's the student's responsibility to prioritize which pieces to read, which to skim, and which to skip. Minimal emphasis on military engagements during the war or economic changes after the war. Difficult to place events on a timeline, but every event is contextualized."
97381,"Strengths - amazing lecturer, amazing TF, great readings Weaknesses - lectures could veer somewhat from readings"
97381,"What first seemed like a weakness--the near-impossible reading list--turned out to be a strength. It was soon realized that not all books were necessary to read, and the breadth of texts made it so that each student could engage deeply with the sub-subjects that interested them."
97381,"Lecture presumes lots of knowledge about happenings of war, which wasnt always a good assumption to make about audience. Didnt focus on battle strategy/battle specifics, which was appreciated.  David blight is obviously a civil war whiz and a pleasure to watch/hear speak."
97381,"It's a great class. My TA (Daniel) was amazing, and the lectures and readings are all interesting. The only thing to know is that Blight isn't a very structured lecturer -- he always just talks about what he thinks is interesting and usually goes 10 minutes over. It doesn't bother me much because he's so good, but it can be annoying at times."
97381,"Somewhat overwhelming reading load, that could be narrowed down to highlight key points for interesting discussions. Professor Blight's lectures were mesmerizing--like your grandpa reading a great epic tale."
97381,"All of Professor Blight's lectures are fascinating and added a lot to my understanding. Professor Blight is the best history lecturer I have had while at Yale because he makes all of his lectures incredibly engaging and incorporates a lot of his research. While there was a lot of reading, I really enjoyed all of the books and articles in the course. As someone who does not enjoy finals, I would have preferred a third essay instead of a final worth 40% of my grade, but that is only a minor downside of the course."
97381,I do wish that Professor Blight's lectures discussed more of the material we read in McPherson and other texts. Writing essays and studying for exams proved more difficult than other history classes because I had to rely solely on the text rather than pulling from the readings and lectures.
97381,The lectures were general but very interesting. Blight is a great storyteller. The readings were where you got the detail.
97381,"This course had very interesting lectures and discussion sections, but it was very difficult to get through the amount of reading that was assigned. If less reading was assigned, section discussions would have been more productive."
97381,The lectures were great and I really like how free the TFs were to teach section how they wanted.
97381,the lectures are incredibly strong because blight is so knowledgeable on the subject. there is an astronomical amount of reading and i think more of it would be completed if the total amount was reduced. i also think a bit more time on the reconstruction era may be better for our conception of the era as a continuous one.
97381,"Strengths: professor is incredible, content is interesting; weakness: sections were very unstandardized and grading felt a little arbitrary"
97381,Course is a large lecture hall that would benefit from more intimate discussion beyond discussion sections
97381,"Blight is an incredible lecturer, readings are interesting, some work but not overwhelming. The paper topics are too broad, however. Theyre the kinds of things you would see on an exam but are hard to write a compelling argument with"
97381,"S: We cover a lot of material and it feels like a fair portrayal of the war. There's not too much than an average history student wouldn't already know, but Blight gives some specific details, story, and poetry that try to bring the stories and emotions of the war to life. The readings, although a lot, are great texts I think I will keep for a long time.  W: Lectures can be a bit chronologically scattered, and sometimes too much time is spent on secondary stories or figures rather than the main events. A fine section, but I don't think it's necessary for the course. Also not much time spent on Lincoln's beliefs and ideologies, very big picture overview.   My biggest complaint was that Blight, although a great professor, has a lot of biases that come through in his lectures. He makes jabs on contemporary politics, conservatives, the religious right, and the Republican Party. Whether it's guns, abortion, elections, or Trump, he would make passing comments that showed his personal beliefs, and seemed out of place in a history lecture. It distracted from the course material, was unnecessary in the large lecture context, and was very frequent. Each class having at least a couple disparaging political comments. It didn't feel discriminatory, but it annoying."
97381,"Strengths - well-structured for someone used to history classes, interesting course material, and helpful TAs. Professor Blight is a huge strength as well! He's an excellent lecturer and makes the material fun to learn. Weaknesses - I don't know how Prof. Blight expects us to read so much (~500 pages per week sometimes) and come to discussion sections prepared. I felt like I was having to pick and choose which readings to do each week, and found that a lot of the money I spent on books early in the semester went to waste."
97381,Strengths-- variety of texts and comprehensive overview of Civil War  Weaknesses-- lack of visual aids during class
97381,There was so much reading that nobody thought it was realistic and nobody did the reading.
97381,Lecture aids
97381,Strengths: blights personality and lectures. Weaknesses: section. People did not do the reading and we had very few substantive discussions.
97381,"The strengths of the course are the diversity of the chosen texts (primary documents, secondary documents, documents pertaining to both the history and Union, and documents that cover the perspective of women and enslaved people as well), the variety and active nature of lectures, and the engagement involved in discussion section. The combination of discussions, lectures, and thorough texts allowed for a nuanced and extensive understanding of the events discussed in the course. A slight weakness of the course is the density of information that was necessary to cover in shorter periods of time."
97381,Great lectures and conversations in section
97381,"The lectures by Professor Blight were incredible and engaging. I never failed to be anything short of entranced by his opening and closing remarks, and even the meat of each lecture always gave me at least one profound insight or takeaway. Unfortunately, much of my course experience was hindered by an overbearing amount of readings and a rather lackluster discussion section. The McPherson is certainly something everyone should read at some point in their life, but I'm not sure trudging through it is the best path the course should take. Instead, focusing on primary source books like the Gienapp and Lincoln Reader encourage a development of historical understanding and method that would be more beneficial for a history course. In terms of my discussion section, my teaching fellow was, according to themself, ill-equipped to be leading a discussion section about the Civil War. They also just generally promoted a class environment that was not conducive to learning. That part of the course really was a disappointment and hampered my overall experience and enjoyment of what was otherwise an in-depth and thorough examination of the Civil War era."
97381,"Strengths: This was my favorite course of the year! Professor Blight is a fantastic and engaging lecturer, so much so that I was upset when lectures were over! Essay assignments provided interesting prompts and were not at all overwhelming, and discussion sections helped me not only organize the material that I had learned but also identify and analyze important themes and trends across the massive amount of material covered in the course.  Weaknesses: Readings are interesting and greatly enrich the lecture material, but the quantity of reading assigned every week is very high, and part of this course is choosing the readings that you will and will not complete."
97381,"The readings are really interesting and Professor Blight is a great lecturer, the TFs are also wonderful and very helpful with digging into the information provided in the readings and the lectures.  One big weakness is the amount of reading: it is a huge amount of reading for a 50 minute twice a week course, especially since very little of the reading is actually covered in lecture. Professor Blight also gets distracted easily and falls behind, which was frustrating because I didn't have a strong background in the subject."
97381,This course was wonderful. The only weakness it has is that it is difficult to condense all of the content into a single semester.
97381,"The major strength of this course is Professor Blight himself. I'd listen to him talk about anything, actually. His passion for history--and within that, his passion for human stories--is infectious and entrancing. This passion is obvious in the way he recounts the story of the Civil War, but also in other things--in his love for poetry (particularly Whitman, read from his lovingly dog-eared copy), the many striking diary entries which he reads aloud, and through his repeated ability to connect history to the present day."
97381,"Blight is maybe my favorite lecturer ever at Yale. I wish there had been fewer readings or that TAs had picked certain readings to discuss because not everyone did the same ones, which made our discussions far less rich than I think they could have been."
97414,"This course was amazing! Lectures were riveting, reading assignments were very carefully curated to supplement lecture material without being repetitive, and the workload was super manageable for a history course. Prof. Magaziner can answer any questions about South Africa, no matter how much they depart from the course material. He's obviously passionate and very knowledgeable about the subject matter, and he makes it easy to see why you should care about this stuff too. No notes!!"
97414,"Professor Magaziner is very eloquent and gives beautifully spoken lectures. That being said, he is sometimes very hard to follow because he isn't guided by dates so I would randomly be in lecture confused on the timeline."
97414,Magaziner is a good and engaging lecturer
97414,I felt that the structure was a little nebulous sometimes
97414,Strengths:  - incredibly engaging professor -great spread of material across time not focusing too much/little on any period   Weaknesses: - perhaps a few too many primary sources for the first few weeks which meant it was more difficult to get into each
97414,Professor Magaziner is incredible. And the readings were incredible.
97414,Strengths: engaging material and lectures weaknesses; overwhelming at time s
97414,"This course had a lot of strengths. Professor Magaziner is probably the most knowledgable and passionate professor i have had at yale, and for my TA, the same. The course was fluid, making great flashbacks to relevant points in history which contributed to a very comprehensive, yet not overwhelming history of South Africa. I think the course could be improved by slightly fewer book readings because it seemed a little too much to read as the semester progressed."
97414,"Strength: lectures were engaging, I appreciated the novels as reading for section, we are taught to look at history critically, appreciated the papers as our assignments where we could reflect on the themes of the class rather than a fact-based exam (because memorizing dates/people etc is not what this class is about). Weaknesses: way too many readings for a lecture class and I struggled to do them all."
97414,"Fascinating content that finds perfect expression in a great lecturer, Daniel Magaziner. The lectures are intense and move incredibly fast but the content is fascinating and presented extremely well. A major strength in my experience was also my TF, Brad Brockman. He made discussion sections fun and engaging and, as a South African himself, brings invaluable expertise to the field of South African study. The assigned reading can be very heavy at times. It is manageable because not all of it needs to be read to be able to understand the course in a given week, but, especially in the last few weeks of class when final papers and projects are coming up, there is a tremendous amount of reading required. My one other piece of advice would be about canvas organization and text accessibility, sometimes the layout of the Files/Modules page made it confusing to find the materials we were expected to read for section every week."
97414,"Strengths: lecture is super interesting and Professor Magaziner is amazing.   Weaknesses: I did not like how this course was structured. Quite honestly, having only two papers, no exams, and sort of random homework readings made it easy for students to completely disengage from the class. You probably could have skipped every lecture and done well in the class if you attended section regularly. I think this is unfortunate given how great the lectures and the class material are."
97414,The lectures were phenomenal and the readings were mostly very good. The lectures were so immersive in their storytelling that sometimes it felt like we needed a step back to provide the exposition though at times.
97414,I think that the lectures could have been better organized -- signposting might have helped.
97414,The course moved at a rapid-fire pace so that it was difficult to digest information or even to take good notes. If the course had moved a little slower and taken its time with key events I think I would have retained a lot more.
97414,The lectures for this course were enthralling - Professor Magaziner is incredible. The discussion section was also surprisingly rewarding; I learned a lot from the thoughts of the TA and my classmates.
97414,"The lectures are extremely rich and in-depth. Professor Magaziner is very accessible and charismatic. His feedback during office hours allowed me to strengthen my writing. I also appreciated the heterogeneity of primary and secondary scholarship, including music, academic journals, novels, and manifestos."
97414,"Prof magaziner is really smart and an interesting lecturer, I like that he told a history of south africa as a story but at times it was hard to grasp onto concrete events so it would have been helpful to have more dates, etc. The readings were interesting but having to read an entire book a week often for a lecture meant that we had to cram to get our discussion posts in so it would have been nice to have a lighter reading load"
97414,The professor was amazing. The content was so interesting. I absolutely loved it!
97414,"Strenths: Various materials for learning (primary and secondary sources - books, newspapers, videos, movies, music, art, etc) Engaging lecture slides Excellent TFs  Weaknesses: Too much information to try and learn in one semester but the task is a large ask but was delivered upon well!"
97414,"Strengths: Magaziner is an amazing lecturer, the readings are interesting, and the workload is not too difficult but is fulfilling Weaknesses: sometimes too much reading"
97414,"Really engaging lecture! However, the weekly reading load is very high."
97414,strength: lectures were very interesting. the themes that the professor focused on were highly engaging.   weaknesses: more secondary source material to balance out the novels we had to read. sometimes i couldn't read the books because they were too long.
97414,"lots of strengths. professor really cares. TAs super accesible. lectures could be a little more linear (jumped around a lot), but overall it wasnt a huge problem"
97414,"The lectures were hard to keep up with because they did not have much structure, and there was very little writing on the slides. This made it hard to follow as names and terms were said in a language I was very unfamiliar with. That being said, the lectures were extremely well thought out."
97414,"The strengths are that Prof. Magaziner's lectures are incredibly engaging (his four lectures during the last two weeks of the semester were some of the best lectures I've attended in the history department). A weakness is that the syllabus often assigns full novels to read in one week this is too much to complete in a single week, and certainly too much to discuss in depth during a 50 minute section. I think assigning a shorter and more manageable reading load each week would allow students to better engage with the readings in more depth, and thus create better, more pointed discussions during section. This is also a small thing, but the syllabus was often confusing to read and understand I think the literal syllabus document could be neatened/better organized."
97423,"This class's greatest strength is its content, particularly in the first half. It is engaging, interesting, and highly relevant to modern African issues. The mechanism by which the content was delivered, however, was often a little too slow for my liking. It was possible to only half-listen to lectures and still understand a majority of the content being discussed. Readings were discussed at length in class, so reading them typically served no external purpose, and sections generally didn't contain enough content to justify their length. On the other hand, Professor Baldwin is a genuinely wonderful person who cares deeply about her students' learning and works hard, and successfully, to ensure individual engagement, so I was never bored in class, and felt that everything we covered had a definite purpose."
97423,"Prof. Baldwin and Mel, our TF, are both fantastic people and together made a great teaching team. Prof. Baldwin is extremely kind and helpful. She scheduled the syllabus in a way that made the final exam earlier than other finals, which was really nice because it was one less class to worry about during the last week of class going into reading period. Also, she's very knowledgeable about the course content, which shows in her lectures. The biggest weakness of the course, I would say, was the readings, and relatedly, engagement in the course. The readings were often not essential and to be honest I hardly did a single reading after spring break. But maybe that wasn't a weakness of the course but just a weakness of mine or a result of my schedule."
97423,Super high quality course. some of the film selections could be a bit better but they are informative either way.
97423,"Strengths: organized course structure, a reasonable balance in readings/materials covered over the semester, and quality of professor and TA.  Weaknesses: more discussion of current events and a different book for the second part of the semester"
97423,Strength: The professor. She was a true gem and just so lovely. She used practical examples to enhance our learning and we had a couple of fun class exercises to enact some of the scenarios we were learning about and that was helpful Weakness: paper grading... grammatical errors are severely penalized
97423,No weaknesses. I loved the course and the instructor is incredible.
97423,"Strength: well-organized: designed to be front-loaded with work, which meant that all assignments were due before finals period started for other courses. covered an enormous range of material in a short time  Weaknesses: because of the range of material covered, lectures often felt frustratingly vague"
97423,"So many strenghts! Professor Baldwin is fantastic, very enthusiastic about the content, is very good at explaining it to students in a manner that is understandable without becoming overwhelming, and very understanding. Another strength of this course is that the workload is very manageable, there is a reasonable amount of readings each week and typically not too much more other than exams and the paper. In addiiton, the TF, Mel, is another strength as she made section fun and the entire class was enjoyable. No weaknesses in the course (I truly appreciate hte opportunity to do an optional final to replace one of our previous grades, I believe this really helped me enjoy the class because I did not have to worry about the grade of each assignment because I knew at the end of the day that I could replace its grade if need be, I really think this should stay and be a component in all classes.)"
97423,"This course is extremely well structured. Every lecture had a centralized theme and by the end, all the themes worked together in order to provide students greater insights on both pre-colonial and contemporary African politics."
97423,"Strengths: A really good baseline overview for understanding African politics at a high level  Weaknesses: Lack of in-depth case studies - I felt our course was too focuses on the theoretical (which, quite frankly, I understand if the that's the goal of the course), but I would have enjoyed it more had I gotten to learn about a couple countries more in-depth."
97423,"Very strong course, no notes on improvement."
97423,The strengths of the course is that it's highly well scheduled with the patience of intellgence of Prof. Baldwin and our TF Mel. I don't see any weakness of the class.
97423,"The course material has interesting moments, but the lectures can be rather dull. Moreover, the attempt to cover almost the entire continent prioritizes breadth over depth, leading to a general lack of specific takeaways."
97423,"Strengths - Really enjoyed doing the readings, and the classes were short and straightforward  Weaknesses - Probably a subjective view but the class mainly focused on West Africa - Nigeria particularly."
97423,"There were probably too many topics covered on such a large continent, so it was hard to fully defend explanations of political development across the continent"
97423,"One of the strengths of the class was the structure of sections and lessons, I felt that they really complemented each other and I felt engaged in both classes instead of feeling a bit disjointed between the two classes."
97443,The course was not very well organized. I didn't really know what was going on each week or where the class was going
97443,Strengths: TF was great really helped to understand the class lecture which was honestly very disorganized and confusing. Weakness: The entire class was so disorganized and not engaging at all. The prof just rambled on and I left each class being very confused by what I was supposed to have taken away. I had a lot of trouble understanding how the syllabus and class lectures related and found the lectures to be Prof. Nyong'o rambling on about things that were unrelated or did not add to any level of understanding.
97443,"Strenghts: some cool readings, interesting discussions in section Weaknesses: lectures are really scattered and unengaging, feels like there's little thru line between them (and sometimes inside of them), often seemed to do a poor job of connecting lecture, readings, and broader point of course."
97443,"Strengths: The material that is covered and the readings are very interesting, enlightening, and make you think about America and your day to day life as an American differently and more critically. Discussion sections were also interesting and where the large majority of learning happened honestly.  Weakness: I often was incredibly confused in lecture, there never really seemed to be an overarching theme or any idea of what the takeaways from the lecture were supposed to be. Lecture also sometimes failed to relate to the readings, which left the course feeling disjointed at times."
97443,Weaknesses: extremely unorganized class. Syllabus constantly changing. Grading expectations still unclear to me.  Strength: TAs were invested in course
97443,"Strengths: I liked the reading list, and the keywords and movies/plays/literature were a great addition to the class. Daniella was also a great TF!"
97443,"The readings and course material were insightful, but the course lectures were hardly related to the assigned readings and lectures were often hard to sit through and not beneficial to the whole understanding of the course."
97443,"I think the discussion sections were a strength of the course as they helped me get a better understanding and see a through line among the texts, clarifying any questions I had. In terms of weaknesses, I felt that the lectures sometimes made it difficult to see the connection between the events discusssed."
97443,"looked amazing on paper, but did not live up to my hopes in reality. selected readings were amazing. however it was hard to grasp how the readings often fit into lecture. lecture felt like a close reading of the readings rather than explaining how the readings help interpret larger themes/trends of the time. each ""unit"" of the course lacked a real arc."
97443,"The material was interesting, but extremely disorganized. There needs to be more continuity between the lectures and readings. One week we were learning about Big Mama Thornton, the next was about IBM. The potential for this class is so high, but I was very disappointed with it."
97443,"The course lacked coherence and failed to make any overarching points or insights into the formation of American Culture. On top of this, lecture felt discombobulated and slow, often placing emphasis on unneeded clips or assuming intimate familiarity with films, books, or other media that the students simply did not have, and then getting sidetracked explaining aforementioned media. The course needs a point, or a set of points, or a tension that it wants to point out, or anything to make sense of what is at present a very poorly curated reading list."
97443,"I thought that the topics were interesting but that the lectures were not especially. I felt like the lectures did not deliver a lot of concrete information about the topics and were much more lofty/theoretical --essentially, I wish they had been more rigorous. I liked when we watched clips of performances in classthat was really cool."
97443,"The overall structure of this class was non-traditional. Lecture time was utilized to analyze the readings for each week. Discussion section was also utilized for the same thing. It would be easier to engage in this course if lecture time was used to learn the historical events that the readings talk about, while discussion section is used to actually analyze the readings and apply it to the historical events we are supposed to learn."
97443,"I thought this was a very weak course. The lectures were mildly interesting at best, and often disjointed and unrelated to eachother."
97443,"The class was poorly structured - in particular, the lectures. Given the broad scope of the class, it was hard to go into depth on any one topic while still covering all the material. In the end, the class felt jumbled and unorganized."
97443,"Strengths: assignments and readings were interesting, clear. Strong effort made in regard to accommodating schedules/student preferences for coursework.   Weaknesses: lectures felt disorganized"
97443,Weaknesses: really disconnected topics and confusing timeline.
97443,"The course was taught out of chronological order and felt like an examination of various different subjects rather than a thorough, continuous examination of American culture. Also the lectures were a snoozefest."
97443,I thought the lectures could be a lot more engaging and interesting.
97443,the syllabus is great but the class is super boring and disorganized in reality
97443,"The course subject and use of music and film really strengthen the class. If I had to pick a weakness I think the readings are a little bit too much. I loved the variety of readings, but it was difficult to stay organized. The course was also strengthened by the flexibility of prompts, which allowed me to pursue my individual interests in a detailed way."
97443,"I thought that the readings and class materials were really interesting. I also really enjoyed my discussion sections, and I found that they really facilitated my learning. However, I found the lectures themselves to be very disconnected and difficult to follow. There wasn't really a through-line in this course; every week was just a different topic, and the overall course did not feel very cohesive to me."
97443,"This course had many strengths. The selection of texts and lecture topics was well put together to facilitate our learning. The quality of the lectures got better over time and I bet this trend would only continue. The paper topics encouraged deep thinking, allowing students to demonstrate what they had learned from the course while bringing in their own ideas and interests. The midterm and final were fair and genuinely enjoyable ways of assessing our engagement with the material. The only weakness of the course is that it (at least initially) assumed a greater background understanding of American History than I had, so some of the material was overwhelming. However, this did not hinder my ability to succeed in the course and did not pose a problem after around a month. This is a great class."
97443,"This course was incredibly helpful in thinking about history through the lens of culture and music, I think a rigid timeline starting out from the beginning could have helped."
97443,"The syllabus was filled with relevant and interesting texts. The texts were incredibly diverse, ranging from plays, textbook-style works, American studies theory, and biographies and memoirs. I absolutely loved that Professor N'yongo opened class with music and there was a course playlist on Spotify to follow along. I would have liked it if there were a few more films, videos, or pieces of art for us to consider.  However, I didn't think the lectures were particularly strong or effective. Many lectures felt unplanned, random, and like a tangent. Professor N'yongo introduced specific and interesting moments and stories throughout the period, but I didn't always understand why. I struggled to see a thru-line between all of the voices he uplifted.  I think more of an emphasis on the thru-line and more moments in class and assignments that are collaborative would have been great. I loved my discussion section; that was the highlight of this course."
97480,I think more relevance if the second half of the class for the project would be good
97480,More engaging in an exciting way.
97480,This was a good QR credit for students who are not very math/STEM oriented. There were some interesting applications. Professor Abinand was at times a bit intense/abrasive but overall a good class.
97480,"Strengths: does not throw too much information at students so they are actually able to internalize, process, and learn the material presented in the course. I liked how the assignments and final project were structured."
97480,Strengths were that we were able to pursue any topic we wanted for our final project. The weaknesses are that lecture attendance was required and that the material could be very dry.
97480,Strengths: good survey course with an interesting end-of-term project to apply lessons learnt
97480,Psets helped affirm what we learned in class
97480,"No consistency with how it was offered with Coifman. Attendance was graded this semester, and project final presentations were also mandated whereas in the past they were offered as a way to boost peoples grades and here they could hurt us."
97480,My only advice would be that Abi should ban laptops. There would be so much more engagement if kids werent scrolling on Twitter or whatever all class
97480,"It could be more interesting, but everyone in the class knew why they were there."
97480,There is a lot of room for creativity in this course especially for the final project as a way to reflect on what you have learned throughout the semester.
97480,"Strengths: clear expectations, homework is submit until correct for full credit, exams are straightforward  Weaknesses: not super engaging, can feel a bit all over the place at times, sometimes difficult to parse through what information/material is important"
97480,it was interesting to learn about how networks connect and how to analyze them
97480,"Really disorganized and the syllabus was not accurate. Assignments were not posted on the syllabus, the grade breakdowns were different than what was actually weighted for our final grades, and there was little to no support for learning material if you missed class."
97480,The course didn't feel like it had a real purpose - we were learning a bunch of different topics that never really connected. I also thought that the professor's lecturing style was dry and did not facilitate good learning. He moved very slowly on a lot of topics but covered the more complicated things in a very brief time. We also got basically no guidance on the final project.
97480,"The strengths of this course were its organization and workload. Professor Gopal always provided detailed instructions to our class, and the workload was very manageable throughout the semester. However, the weakness of this course was that sometimes the lectures could have been more engaging. Often, Professor Gopal would write on the chalkboard without slides prepared, which could make the lesson as a whole a little hard to follow."
97481,"Strengths - weekly psets of a good length, enough to learn content, but not work overload - good pace of class - classes are relatively small ( max 20 people?) so you can be engaged and actually learn the content in class"
97481,Strengths: thorough; engaging; several opportunities to seek guidance. Weaknesses: lack of clear online resources; somewhat unorganized; inadequate material to prepare for exams.
97481,"I loved the opportunity to apply concepts, do practice problems in class, and meet with the teacher outside of the course times."
97481,"Strengths: helpful professor and office hours of professor and TAs Weaknesses: Lack of overall resources by course director, only one practice exam, ambiguous grading policy"
97481,"Brett is a great lecturer; he makes math fun and explains concepts in a neat way; the project was definitely a cool experience (though it was stressful to complete in the moment, the end product was very rewarding); the psets are all very doable and straightforward; my only complaint would be the lack of practice material for exams"
97481,"Strengths: Knowledgeable instructors, fairly available office hours, manageable content Weaknesses: The class is typically full of people who already have a decent grasp of the content, which makes it more difficult for someone coming in who hasn't worked with linear algebra concepts before"
97481,A strength of the course was the final project - I learned a lot doing that. The quality of the peer tutors was also a strength. A weakness was that I wish we had been able to have more of a taste of the proofs even if it wasn't as thorough as 225.
97481,I liked the psets. The slides were effective.
97484,"Strengths - well structured, the textbook is comprehensive, and the instructor is organized and approachable Weaknesses - while the instructor is approachable, he would sometimes rush through final slides of lecture"
97484,"This class was great. I was a bit afraid to take a math class as a bio major but this class was well taught and low stress in my opinion. I loved how applications felt central to the course, not just as add-ins. Very few weaknesses."
97484,"Strengths:  Lectures were very high-quality, and class was highly organized. The office hours were extremely helpful. Homework was a very reasonable length & was (mostly) representative of exam content. The project was helpful and allowed us to explore linear algebra applications of our interest.  Weaknesses: Some of the exams had conceptual true/false questions which our homework did not adequately prepare us for. The office hours were not as abundant as I would have liked."
97484,"The course was well organized, good office hours, and great professor."
97484,"I think the course was well balanced problem sets were consistent in difficulty, though the first and only midterm happened early in the semester such that the final was a lot more of the grade in the end."
97484,"I believe that this course provides strong academic learning, through well structured lessons and a project."
97484,This course benefited from the ample study hall and office hours opportunities. I always felt academically supported and that I could always go somewhere for help.
97484,Professor Barnes restructured the course to be far more intuitive. He was a real strength and did a great job of teaching linear such that students actually really understood what was happening
97484,"strength: pset arent very long, the content is pretty applicable for engineering majors  weakness: the course is taught in a very application based way, however the exams felt quite conceptual. more practice sets for exam prep it would be very helpful"
97484,"This course gave me practice with the basics of linear algebra, but it was not very engaging and did not leave me feeling that I had a strong conceptual grasp of the material. I think the course could be improved with better organization."
97488,"Overall, while the instructor had a clear passion and interest for educating students, this course had a serious lack of direction and organization. There was little transparency on the course listing about what this class would be about, students did not learn what we signed up for, and it felt each week a new topic was talked about on the spot. Often, lectures were centered around very long Jupyter Notebook files, which were confusing to understand and unorganized. We would skip around these Jupyter Notebook files, only completing a small fraction of the lectures with little understanding of what we were learning, why it was important, or where the class was going. It felt as if these materials were borrowed from a different class and an attempt was made to repurpose them for this class. Homework (particularly in the beginning) did not align at all with what was taught in the class. By front-loading students with the abstract math of tensors and optimization algorithms to read on their own, the class was structured such that did not understand what was being taught or where to apply it. We would then shift gears, only to return to a similar topic 8 weeks later. We received little feedback on our assignments that made it difficult to improve. With time, it was evident that students became very discouraged and would 'shut down' in the class, not participating or answering questions, because nobody knew what was expected of us or the class organization.  Towards the end of the class, we spent time doing linear algebra but spent so long on fundamentals (that were pre-requisites and taught in math classes) that we never applied it much to machine learning algorithms.   For a class about computational tools for data science, we worked very little with data, which was disappointing.   It's clear the instructor is highly knowledgeable about the subject and has a desire to help students, but time should be taken to develop a curriculum that can be followed. I believe SDS 230 with Ethan Meyers with would be a great course to use as a reference, where lectures were organized and from the beginning there was a structured understanding of what would be taught."
97488,strength: assignment based weakness: don't feel that we learned how to do the assignments in class.
97488,"This class is definitely gives you a crash course in tools for data scientists. However, it focuses WAY too much on theory. I think it needs to stick to teaching technical things more as that is the purpose of the class. We get enough linear algebra theory elsewhere..."
97488,"Strengths: Professor Lederman (Roy) is a kind and patient professor and wants his students to understand the material  Weaknesses: The course was largely unstructured, lectures were not very engaging or organized, the order of topics throughout the semester was confusing and did not relate to each other, overall unorganized."
97488,Most people were not very engaged with the material.
97488,Strengths-- interesting content Weaknesses- poorly organised
97488,"This course offers several notable strengths that contribute to a comprehensive learning experience. It provides valuable insights into diverse aspects of data analysis, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of the subject matter. The course is rigorous in nature, challenging students to delve deep into the topics covered. Additionally, it covers a wide range of relevant subjects, providing a broad knowledge base for students. However, there are certain areas where improvements could be made. The instructor's approach assumes a high level of pre-existing knowledge, which may create difficulties for some students. The homework assignments follow an unconventional pattern, which can be confusing for learners. Moreover, the grading system places excessive emphasis on the absence of errors in the code, rather than evaluating the overall completeness and correctness of the assignments. Addressing these weaknesses by providing clearer instructions and incorporating a more comprehensive grading approach would enhance the course's effectiveness and overall learning experience."
97488,"strength: gained us comprehensive knowledge on many fields, which is good as an introductory course weakness: the level of involvement of linear algebra is too high, which makes it also a hard class"
97489,"Strengths: manageable workload, important material. Weaknesses: you kind of have to teach yourself a lot of the material."
97489,"strengths - engagement, learning, interesting psets"
97489,Very challenging intellectually
97489,"Strengths: the course was very related to real-world applications, and problem set questions (as well as class discussions) often centered around real data and questions you might face outside of the college setting"
97489,"I thought the assignments and Professor MacDonald were very fun, engaging, and informative. Ed discussion posts and office hours were also extremely helpful. Not many weaknesses to be honest"
97489,Strengths: The course was well organized and we got to work with interesting datasets. Brian is a kind and likable professor. Weaknesses: I am coming away from the semester with a hard time nailing down what I actually learned. Sometimes the lectures felt more like tinkering with code for an hour than learning concrete concepts.
97489,"Strengths: It was a relatively chill class (except for when the psets were randomly very burdensome). Lots of practical content (knowing when to use certain models based on the characteristics of the response variable), and theory was superficial but enough so that you can succeed in an interview.  Weaknesses: Not sure why there was a final exam, should have been a final project to demonstrate we had learned the skills. Class lacked direction at times and was sometimes unorganized, but it was also Brian's first time teaching the course."
97489,Have many hands-on experiences and includes the usage of some novel packages. Can incorporate a bit more theoretical knowledge.
97489,This course is just a mishmash of random stats topics that just regurgitates topics from other more foundational courses like 242 or 312. It was okay/good R practice. The walking through examples was slow and not really giving.
97489,I think Brian is very experienced and knowledgeable in his field. I do wish we had more time with him explaining what model he would consider instead of just coding a single model. I think choosing the model is the fun part and the boring bits can be left to HW. I also think Brian can let the class take over sometimes and we get less done. But he is new and already really good.
97489,"The professor tried to make this class not a gut, but in the process of doing that, he explained things weirdly and I feel like most people who did not have a strong stats back ground did not really understand what was going on. This class sounds like it was better taught in the past. Instead of trying to not make it a gut, I think we should keep it as it was. Or in fact, change it so that it focuses more on questions that are asked in Data Science interview questions (like keep ROC/AUC, performance metrics, different types of regressions, and add other stuff like sampling techniques, spend more time on bootstrapping, etc)."
97489,"This was the prof's first time teaching the class, so there were some bumps in the road. However, I think this class is one of my favorites in the stats major. Learned more than any other class. I think it's a shame this course has 3 exams, this is the perfect course for a final project to apply the information that we learn."
97489,"The course goes over some very interesting material, but the pacing felt awkward at times and the lecture recordings were very hit or miss"
97489,"Problem sets are great; they help you understand the material better and they complement class stuff well. Sometimes the timing of things was off. We'd occasionally spend a long time on a simple topic, then cram in a more complex one in one or two lectures. I imagine that this is partly bc this is the first semester that BMac has taught this class, so it may not be true in the future."
97489,"weakness: not engaging, material ramps up too quickly"
97489,"I think the workload, exams, and grading were very fair, and the problem sets made sure you were keeping up with the material. I appreciated the courses focus on practical data analysis skills while still touching upon the theory behind them. I think it might be interesting to use a slightly more diverse array of datasets."
97489,"Strengths: Brian is an amazing professor! He's very engaging and clearly passionate about what he does. He breaks down complicated concepts with ease and brings practical applications to what could've been an overly theoretical class.  Weaknesses: The class felt like a topics course as we bounced around from topic to topic without a lot of cohesion. This wasn't necessarily the worst, but I think I would've appreciated a bit more linkage as to how everything related. Also, some of the problem sets were really hard, but manageable if you went to office hours."
97489,The class felt a little disorganized but there was always help present if we needed anything.
97489,"The course had an odd balance of moving either too fast or too slow, but overall it didn't feel like we learned very much."
97489,"I think the class could have moved a bit more quickly. I think it should also maybe operate from the assumption that everyone has taken S&DS 230 because the beginning of class was a bit slow.  Other than that, it was a fun class where I learned a lot through the activities and the group work in class."
97489,"Strengths: One of the most practical stat classes I have taken at Yale, very engaging assignments"
97489,"Strengths: The class material was tremendous and useful. Macdonald is a great lecturer who obviously cares about his students learning. He is very personable and was approachable, even though I hadn't taken a class with him before.  Weaknesses: The TF staff was terrible. I don't think I've ever left a negative comment about grading on a CourseTable review before because we are in college (and at this point, who really cares), but I cannot imagine what was going through their minds. Hopefully, when future Yalies are taking this class, the TF staff will be different."
97489,Strengths: This course covered a lot of topics and gave me the opportunity to practice many of them. Weaknesses: I felt as though more time could have been devoted to certain topics.
97489,Overall really good introduction to statistical modeling using R. Only improvement I would suggest is to have more thorough course notes.
97489,"Strengths: topics/skills learned are very useful and applicable to jobs in statistics. Homework assignments help build these skills as opposed to being busywork.  Weaknesses: most of the important information from lectures is concentrated in 5-10 minutes of the 75 min class (and often kinda rushed through), making it hard to focus."
97489,course recordings needed. more useful interesting material needed.
97489,I liked Brians lecturing style and how we followed along on an Rmd document during class. I also think having a pedagogical partner was really helpful he suggested having practice exams which I really appreciated.
97489,"This course was great in terms of giving us a glimpse of what real world data analysis is like. This course felt a bit scattered at times since Professor MacDonald made us do ggplot animations, R shiny apps, and some maximum likelihood estimators for the normal distribution. There were also instances where we would get points taken off on our homework because they didn't think the formatting of our plots was ""clean"" enough which felt a bit subjective at times."
97489,Course material is well thought out to provide students with a solid background in data exploration and analysis
97489,"Overall while I do think the materials in this course were worthwhile, there seemed to be a wide range of students in this class with different backgrounds, and it seemed like there was some challenge in keeping a pace that was appropriate for every student. I found it somewhat difficult to stay engaged in lecture sometimes because many of the topics were ones I was already familiar with and I didn't feel like I was learning anything new. Sometimes homeworks seemed tedious and uninteresting. It seemed like also there was a small disconnect between what was covered in class lectures and what was asked on exams - perhaps more focus could be done in class about deciding which model would be appropriate given a dataset.  Also - while interesting and really cool, I think some of the topics involving animations and Shiny could maybe be moved to the end of the course since they didn't seem that relevant to the course as a whole and time could have been better dedicated to other things."
97489,The large nature of the class meant there was a wide difference in peoples abilities. Perhaps separate undergrad and grad sections might make things run better.
97489,"For the first half of the class, we reviewed linear regression, how to use basic R packages and made a Shiny app. After this, the class seemed to complete change pace and difficulty. We rushed through all of the new content, making it feel like Professor MacDonald had a clear vision of how the course was meant to progress. In order to understand any of the problem sets past the one about ggplot or Shiny, you had to go to office hours, but the only useful hours were with one of the TFs. Further, it feels odd that the class is final exam based and not project-based. A class like this would be perfect if the skills we gained were used to level up to a project, but instead we got an extremely simple and misleading first midterm, then a poorly-made and extremely confusing second midterm which we were ill-equipped for, based on the lecture (and the fact that Professor MacDonald declined to provide a practice exam for the second midterm, because he believed that the first had been ""too easy"")."
97489,good coverage of topics but more applied than theoretical
97489,"I really enjoyed using datasets multiple times to become more familiar with them, and as a sports fan I enjoyed how Prof. MacDonalds sports analytics data science background shaped many of the examples in class"
97489,Strengths: Brian is great Weaknesses: parts of the homework can sometimes be tedious/frustrating
97489,"Rework Github into the course, maybe do an introductory GitHub workshop or lecture"
97489,lectures could be more interesting
97489,"Strengths: The material was relatively easy to understand and learn. The psets and exams weren't very difficult either. Weaknesses: I do feel like my understanding of some of the topics taught in class was very surface-level i.e. we didn't go very in-depth with theory with much of the material. This is probably the way the class was designed, but I think some more context to some of the R that we did would've been nice."
97494,"Strengths: I loved how Professor Harms used music, movies, and relevant examples to explain the concepts. The sections were also very helpful.  Weaknesses: Sometimes I would come out of class and not be sure what I learned and how it related to Anthropology. We would spend so long talking about something and I either wouldn't understand it or couldn't relate it to anything else in the course. I don't know if I actually gained a strong basis in socio-cultural anthropology or just spent a semester listening to whatever Professor Harms wanted to teach us. Additionally, while the assignments were interesting and I like the idea of exploring the culture of Yale, the instructions were so dense with words that they were hard to understand, and yet they said very little about what we were supposed to do. Sometimes it felt like my TA and I were trying to decipher what he had asked us to do, and it often had little relevancy to the course material, or asked us to use skills that we hadn't developed in class. Additionally, the midterm and final had a weird matching section that felt like rote memorization, not productive to deepening our understanding of the complex themes and ideas of anthropology."
97494,"Strengths: My TF was incredible and helped us to understand the core concepts and why we were reading certain texts. Professor Harms is a great lecturer who tries to engage with students and is extremely enthusiastic about anthropology.  Weaknesses: 9am on MW is a brutal time slot. Lectures sometimes felt disjointed in relation to readings. While this isn't necessarily a fault of the class, lots of sociocultural anthropology still feels very rooted in its colonial origins and even modern pieces of ethnography still have roots of this legacy."
97494,"Strengths: Eric Harms is such a great professor and makes the class really fun. The topics are also very interesting, particularly in the first half of the course. But the biggest strength to me was actually the ethnographic assignments. It lets you try out anthropology for yourself, and I learned a lot of interesting things about the discipline and about Yale itself doing them.  Weaknesses: Sometimes, the lectures and readings feel a bit all over the place. I think the course could be streamlined somewhat, perhaps by cutting the documentaries and making each topic a little narrower. It's great to get exposure to so many different ideas and anthropologists, but sometimes it felt like I wasn't learning as much as I could have if we delved in a little deeper. I feel like the first half of the course did a better job staying on topic than the second half. Also, I didn't find the final paper particularly helpful. It would have been fun to do our own project on a new idea, but it didn't add very much to my learning to go over old assignments."
97494,"Sometimes it was difficult to understand which topics were important to remember, and how the readings directly tied to the themes we discussed in class. However, everything we did discuss was fascinating."
97494,strenghts: The flow of the course through the semester was great. lectures can be very engaging.
97494,"This is a great class. Strengths: the readings are manageable and actually interesting!! The lectures are engaging and variable (videos, songs, texts, discussion) and the professor is super passionate and takes an straightforward approach to teaching, showing all sides of each debate/issue. Weaknesses: you have to do ethnographic observations of fellow Yale students which is dumb and annoying. I didn't learn much from these. Luckily they don't take much time to complete."
97494,"The strengths were the lectures. Professor Harms was incredibly passionate about the subject matter and relayed it in an engaging manner. I think however, that the lectures could have been reduced to 50 minutes because they often felt slightly long. The readings were a strengthnot too overwhelming and they all contributed to a better understanding of the course material. Another weakness I would point out is the exams. I wish there had been study guides for concepts, because I often felt like I studied the wrong things and was tested on authors and concepts that were briefly mentioned and not thoroughly covered."
97494,"The lecture style was incredibly structured, and I really loved how enthusiastic Professor Harms is about the material. I also found the amount of reading each week and the general workload to be very manageable."
97494,"This strength is very accessible to anyone in that everyone has the skills to engage with and learn about cultural anthropology. The content learned is also very applicable to everyday life. One weakness of the course is that some of the key terms and ideas of the course have loose definitions, which may make it challenging to understand them."
97494,"The lectures are a nice amount of time, and the material is interesting. The professor is a proficient public speaker and always comes prepared. I wish we could have spent more time reviewing for the exams or have had a study guide to go off of though."
97494,"Good professor, engaging lecturer. Good slides, interesting material, good job at covering a wide range of anthropological examples from throughout the world and over time. Good attention to the racist, problematic nature of the field of anthropology historically (and now), and how anthropologists and others should learn from this history and engage in better practicescould be delved into even more. Fun, interesting writing exercises. A little name/place memorization heavy for my taste, but understandable for the type of course. An excellent intro anthropology lecture."
97494,"I think a great strength of this course is the lectures. The lectures were engaging and helpful, and connected to the reading just enough so that we see how it thematically fits into our weekly discussion, but not too much so that more time can be spent expanding the discussion. The best part of the course was the discussion section."
97494,"The course is very well organized, and the readings are very connected to what we learn in class. The assignments are magnificent and help us get involved with what we learn through our own observations of Yale Culture. However, sometimes we had too much reading assigned."
97494,"Strengths: The amount of content covered is just right, and the overall arc of the course (cultural difference, power and the ""dark turn"", resistance and possibility) is built well to make the course engaging and transformative -- a bit of a ritual analogue in its own right. The readings are all incredibly interesting in their own right. Prof. Harms has a deep conviction about the importance of anthropological thinking, and makes the case extremely effectively through this course."
97501,The readings are sometimes not very engaging and not what I expected but the class is amazing! The professor is great and the work is engaging and fun!
97501,Feedback pertaining to papers was not adequate. Critique felt impossible to improve on or was not properly explained in the instructions.
97501,I think if there were more writing from the cultures themselves versus outsider views.
97501,"I loved the readings and the pop quizzes as well as the group assignments. I do wish we got more time for the group projects, however."
97502,"It sometimes gets a little boring, but Prof's interest and knowledge of the material made it interesting."
97502,Strengths: very interesting material Weaknesses: Watts tries to cover all primates when maybe studying certain primates would lend to better understanding.
97502,"Strengths: Very knowledgeable professor, recommended readings were provided for those who wanted more information. Professor leaves detailed comments on all of you papers.   Weaknesses: Because you're not held responsible for memorizing any of the content, so it's very easy to disengage"
97502,"The strength of the course was definitely Professor Watts' knowledge and command of the topic. One weakness of the course is that it sometimes took Professor Watts a while to post assignment prompts, which could be frustrating if you were trying to work ahead."
97502,This is an OK course.
97502,"I think one of the strengths is that the subject material is very interesting, especially some of the readings, however, the course is not very engaging."
97502,Strength: There is a lot of flexibility. A lot of optional reading material to further explore your interests. The workload is manageable enough for you to not stress out too much. Great feedback on assignments.  Weakness: Not as structured.
97503,I thought that a major strength was the discussion section since it allowed us to interact with Professor Watts closely and have him answer our specific questions. I also think that another strength was that the lecture presentations were very comprehensive and easy to follow. I didn't think that this class had many major weaknesses.
97503,"Strengths: the course load was manageable and good. Professor Watts was very punctual about posting his lectures before he gives them so that students could follow along or go back and review. The organization of the slides was a bit confusing, it was more of a sit and listen lecture than take notes verbatim. I enjoyed this style, it helped students form their own political opinions of the topics we discussed. The discussion sections were very interesting, I enjoyed the ability to talk with Professor Watts directly outside of the lecture. I also highly enjoyed watching short documentaries and then having section discussions about the topics. I learned a lot through this model from the professor and my other classmates.   Although the lectures dragged on a bit. Perhaps cutting the class time shorter would keep students engaged."
97503,More videos
97503,"strengths: The class isn't all that difficult, but the topics are super interesting and important, and they are approached with a tremendous amount of care and attention to look at many perspectives on the issue! Prof Watts makes this class truly special; he cares so much about the animals he's teaching about as well as the people who share spaces with them, and he makes the class a really enjoyable and inspirational experience. I loved the discussion sections that he led himself, and hearing all the anecdotes from his own field work was really cool. The workload is very manageable, and the assignments are split up into small ones throughout the semester so that there's never a week where you're completely overloaded. Weaknesses: none."
97503,"The lectures can be a bit boring, especially if you aren't interested in primates, specifically, but if you appreciate the conservation history and politics, you'll appreciate the course."
97503,The strengths were the variety of materials Professor Watts provided to aid our understanding of his lectures. Weakness: It was not engaging except in discussion sections.
97503,"The course was very enjoyable, but I feel like it was hard to engage with some the content specific to monkeys. Perhaps a local zoo-keeper could bring in a monkey to show the class?"
97503,Strengths: easy to follow and good professor
97503,Strengths: Professor Watts is very engaging and knowledgeable.
97503,I really loved this class. Professor Watts gives great lectures and is really passionate about the subject. I wouldn't change anything about the class.
97503,"Strengths: Professor Watts is so passionate about conservation and has so much knowledge to share. Section mainly focuses on watching videos and discussing them, which was a new (for me) and engaging way to interact with the course material.   Weaknesses: Incorporating more discussion into the lecture times would make them more interactive."
97503,I loved the workload. It allowed us to delve deeply into what we truly cared about during our sections.
97503,Very engaging and interesting content
97503,The professor is very nice and accommodating and is very open for discussion. I enjoyed the discussion sections as they allowed for smaller group discussions.
97503,Great lectures and discussion section
97503,"Very good course. Enjoyed Professor Watts as a lecturer and he had very interesting points in the section. Very nice, caring, flexible, and enjoyed hearing about his work in the field"
97503,There are no weaknesses with the course. This course has the strength of promoting student engagement with the material through the different reading responses and discussion section.
97503,"Rather than so many small assignments that were difficult to keep track of, I would have preferred fewer, longer papers or presentations."
97503,The mutiple types of media used in the course made it more engaging.
97551,"The course is a lecture despite being framed as a seminar. This is not necessarily a drawback since the professor has an enormous amount of experience. It should just be marketed as such for students to know what they are signing up for. The field trips, guest lecturers, and final presentation make for an excellent class structure."
97551,More emphasis on overall themes and takeaways rather than throwing so much content at us during every lecture. Guest lectures were wonderful and I'm grateful Prof Prober put so much effort into inviting so many interesting guests.
97551,It could be less reliant on the midterm and final presentation.
97551,"Strengths: Broad range of topics in energy, engaging field trips to Kroon Hall and Yale Power Plant, and very caring Professor, often bringing in solar cars for us to build and keep, interesting guest lecturers, and snacks!  Weaknesses: The every day class format was not as engaging, as it would consist of presenting Powerpoint slides. However, I still learned a lot, as the slides covered many different topics every class!"
97551,I hope there could be participation grade to force participation.
97551,A strength of the course was the content we studied. It was very thorough and of appropriate depth depending on the subject. The multidisciplinary way we approached issues was also a major strength. The guest multiple lecturers were engaging and added their unique perspective to the issues discussed in the course. The main weakness of the course was the lack of clear organization of readings from the book lining up with topics discussed in class during the first half of the course.
97551,Strength of this course would be the final project and research!   This course could be improved by having more in-class discussions in a seminar setting.
97551,"Strengths include a good ""leminar""-style (the professor basically talked for the entire class and paused for questions), good organization, and a fun final project. One weakness was that the course was very intense for the first half, until the midterm, and then fell off dramatically."
97551,"The course could be greatly improved if the slides were provided before class (without paper) and the class time was used for discussion of current events or historical breakthroughs. I greatly enjoyed the concentration of guest speakers in the second half of the semester, but also wish they could be slightly more spread out throughout the class schedule."
97552,"although the subjects that are taught are intersting, its very boring and quite slow"
97552,"Wish there was more clarity on the exams, they were tougher than the sample exams and problem sets."
97552,A strength of this course was the breadth of topics we covered. There weren't any weaknesses I observed.
97552,"This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Support from Professor Miller and the TFs was abundant, and feedback was clear. The exams were fairno trick questions and we were allowed a single sheet of notes. The psets were both challenging and fun. This is a very well-run course."
97552,"The class moved very quickly yet forgivingly. The grading scheme seems pretty lenient (knock on wood) but I honestly don't feel like I learned that much because of how quickly the class moved. I took AP Physics 1 and self-studied AP Physics C in high school but I still felt like I did not have a rigorous-enough understanding of basic Physics electricity and magnetism concepts before we jumped to more complicated technologies. The tests are very hard, and while the curve seems generous, I do think the tests worded the material in ways incongruent with the ways we learned them. Overall: the lectures are mildly engaging, the curve seems (again, I hope) forgiving, but I didn't learn that much in the class and it was very hard for me."
97552,"This course was amazing! I learned so much and loved attending every lecture. This course did a really good job of simplifying complicated topics so everyone could understand. The pset were relevant and important to further understanding of the materials and while the exams were hard, I thought they were reasonable and good."
97552,"Strengths: The lectures were interesting, and the midterms were fair (especially with the curve). I also think Professor Miller was always willing to help and the near daily office hours meant there were always places to turn if you were confused. Weaknesses: none!"
97552,Strengths - amount of resources available Weaknesses - The extremely fast pace
97552,"Strength: lectures were engaging Weakness: exams were typical physics department exams where the average was a crushing 50-60 each time, often felt like you knew course material well but could not translate it to the exam."
97552,good lecturing and resources
97552,"Strengths: the course was able to get through many interesting topics and was generally quite intuitive; I liked the structure of participation (Pollev questions graded on completion), which encouraged class attendance and engagement without adding stress about having to get the right answer Weaknesses: because this class covers such a breadth of topics, the level of depth in each topic wasn't always enough to understand the finer details (which may or may not be important depending on what you're looking for)"
97552,"Extremely boring lectures, decently difficult exams. Owen Miller clearly knows his stuff and is a brilliant guy, just not the best lecturer. At least the curve is nice. Only take if you need a science credit."
97552,"This course was a great experience, largely due to the strengths of the course, which were rooted in the professor, Owen Miller's teaching style. Miller is an engaging and informative instructor who is always willing to provide feedback to students, even on short notice. He responds quickly and with enthusiasm to any questions, which was greatly appreciated.  One of the unique features of this course was the attendance criteria, which was enforced through the use of PollEverywhere. This approach encouraged students to attend each class and stay up to date with the course content, ensuring that everyone had a solid understanding of the material.  The live demonstrations were another strength of the class, particularly the use of 3D glasses, polarization sheets, and observing the formation of standing wave patterns on sand. These demonstrations helped to bring the material to life and made the class engaging and exciting.  However, there were also a few weaknesses to the course that should be noted. For one, the class met early in the morning, which could be a challenge for some students who struggled to stay alert during lecture. Additionally, the problem sets and exams were extremely harshly graded, with even minor mistakes resulting in significant point deductions. While this may have been intended to challenge students and ensure a high level of understanding, it also made the course more stressful and difficult than it needed to be.   Finally, there was a notable lack of coverage of the ""Hairy Ball"" Theorem :(  Nonetheless, the course as a whole was a valuable learning experience that provided practical skills and knowledge of the applications of physics. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in exploring physics in a practical and engaging way, with the caveat that the grading may be more challenging than expected and the early morning class time may be difficult for some."
97552,"The strength is definitely Professor Owen, the material taught and the way it was taught. I really liked the structure of having two exams early on in the term and then giving time for a final video project that was a lot of fun to make. The only real weakness I would say is that sometimes it felt that the explanations required on exams and problem sets were way too specific, more than what is necessary."
97552,"Weakness is that everyone does very, very bad on the exams and it is disheartening. If you think you'd be the one to do well just know that I've like never gotten below a B on an exam and got a 52 on the first exam hah. This is your warning now."
97552,"Thought it was great, super organized and fair to the students"
97552,"I think the video project, nice as it is to have something short for the end of term, meant I was unengaged with the material in the lectures affer the second midterm and struggled to focus.   A third exam, or two exams placed differently, would have been preferable.  But overall I'm pleased with this class -- it covers a lot of ground and the exams are such that you have to learn the material in order to do well. It isn't a gut."
97552,Content was great but problem sets and exams nothing like lecture
97552,"Incredibly engaging and well-structured course, and super supportive professor! No weaknesses I can think of"
97552,This course is clearly organized and works pretty well. it is deceptively hard and it may take some time to fully understand how much work constitutes to a good grade.
97552,It was not as engaging as I had hoped; I also wish that there was more of an emphasis on foundational topics in physics.
97552,"Strengths: Professor Miller has a ton of passion for the material, and it's especially interesting when he drops pieces of knowledge about himself that tie into the material (his PhD research, his past research, his research that was funded by Meta, to name a few). I think the in-class demos are a wonderful addition the course, and really add to the novelty of much of the material.  Weaknesses: unfortunately, the course is not really tailored to the humanities student fulfilling their science requirement. I come from a decent science background (although not a super strong physics background) and this was my fatal error. The first topic of the course, electricity/magnetism, is very difficult to understand, and I honestly think learning some of the calculus might've helped. ""Magnetic flux"" is a super conceptually challenging idea to wrap one's head around, and we spent an inadequately dearth of time on it in-class. The P-Sets, especially in the beginning of the course, were exceedingly difficult, and I along with my friends took very detailed, diligent notes on the material AND used Prof. Miller's course notes and slides to supplement. I found the TAs largely useless; one in particular wasn't very interested in actually helping the struggling students. I am the type of person who requires a lot of guidance when I go through complex topics and ideas, and I didn't get them, so I honestly lost the desire to go discuss with the TAs at all. Professor Miller told us that he creates and grades the exams based on ""mastery"" of the material; I have a fundamental issue with the notion that one must be assessing students for ""mastery"" and thus penalizing them on a grand level. For a course that is intended to be an introduction to higher-level science/math concepts for the non-STEM student, one need not 'master' the material to have learned something. And the grade, in my humble opinion, should reflect that. The exams were, frankly, very very challenging -- and not in a good way. One student actually scored 100% on the first exam, which speaks volumes as to the composition of the course: some people were coasting b/c they'd taken heavy duty physics previously. Others like me were on the struggle bus with no end in sight. The course generally tries to cover too much content in too little time -- we should sit with the material a little bit longer, go through more examples... and perhaps lower expectations in an introductory, general science course. I looked into the course that Prof. Miller claims to have modeled this off of (at Berkeley) and the approach to assessment is vastly different, and the conceptual challenge-level is slightly lower. That would have been a recipe for greater success. But if I have to pore over the p-sets for hours on end and not understand any of it... there's a problem."
97552,Its a good course for ppl who dont wanna a crazy science class. It seems harder than it really is in the beginning so stick with it.
97552,"Moves fast, PSETS not always related to class material"
97552,"Strengths: Extremely well organized, Prof. Miller was very good at explaining tough concepts in a digestible manner Weaknesses: Exams more difficult than expected"
97552,"strengths: Professor Miller is really nice and helpful, and office hours are life saving. The material can be relatively interesting and relevant.  weaknesses: it's not really a gut. the material is honestly very very hard to understand for those who are not naturally physics-minded. psets require a lot of help and the tests are designed to be incredibly challenging."
97552,"Strengths: good professor, interesting material  Weaknesses: this class would work SO much better as a seminar rather than a lecture. I didn't end up learning as much as I would have liked, and the class wasn't super fun."
97552,Strengths: Clear instructing
97552,"Strengths: Amazing STEM course for non-STEM people! I learned a lot and it was very accessible. Professor Miller is an amazing teacher and really supportive and helpful. Weaknesses: a few TFs seemed a little unprepared but even so, I never felt at a disadvantage academically, and Office Hours were always very helpful"
97552,Ok course
97552,I think it was a great course! Loved the diversity of topics!
97552,"Strengths: the Professor, the organization of the course, the teaching assistants, resources available to help with exam preparation, the final project, and the curriculum (which felt very relevant to the technologies we encounter in the world around us). Weaknesses: The class was very large, which made it more difficult to engage with the material."
97552,"Strengths - attendance grade requires some level of engagement, TFs were super helpful, Professor Miller communicated often and clearly with us Weaknesses - definitely has silos of teams who do psets and study together which can make the class daunting if you do not have a group of peers to work with (find your own!)"
97552,The problem sets sometimes asked questions that weren't covered in lecture enough. The TA's were extremely helpful in understanding the homework.
97552,Lectures are super entertaining. I'll miss some lectures in other classes (like we all do) but didn't like skipping this because it was so interesting.
97552,"The strengths are that it does a good job summarizing how different technologies improved. However, since some of the topics were very hard to understand, I think we should have gone more into detail and done more practice problems."
97552,Strengths: Teaching method and the way concepts are described. The diagrams used to describe concepts.
97552,I think this class was awesome and I wouldnt change anything.
97552,"Strengths: Prof Miller really sets you up for success. There are a lot of resources and practice questions available, and a lot of additional material to help you study and get confident in the material. However, this class is really not a gut while there's no math, it is very conceptual and you will have to really engage in order to do well."
97552,"I have only good things to say about the instruction and content of this course. The option to watch the course via the media library is a great option, but I found myself coming to class the majority of the time. The one weakness that I will highlight is that the first few problem sets are pretty difficult to do on your own if you have little background in physics. I found that I had to rely on the teaching fellows to help me understand how to do the problem sets in the beginning of the semester. With that being said, you certainly gain an intuition and get better at them over time."
97552,"The class was super interesting, but a little more mathematically rigorous than expected for a ""gut"" science class. Content was great, but teaching staff also was pretty eager to take off a lot of points for minor errors"
97552,"The course was well organized and expectations were clear and the material was interesting, even to someone without a strong science background. The only weakness is that sometimes Professor Miller was a bit overly ambitious with the topics he tried to explain."
97553,it was very fast-paced but overall a good class. i wish there were more office hours over zoom because i wasnt able to make a lot of them.
97553,"more resources and office hours would make this course better, but other than that the strengths are that there is only one midterm, and both the midterm and final are open notes"
97553,"Strengths: Course was very low-stress. Exams were open note, which allowed us to focus more on problem-solving than on rote memorization of formulas.   Weaknesses: Lectures were a little unengaging. I also did not enjoy course instruction being done on a blackboard (which was often hard to read). I would prefer if the course was taught through pre-made lecture slides or examples written out on an iPad projected to the screen. There were also very limited office hours."
97553,"The biggest strength is the open-note nature of the course. We are encouraged to work together and use our resources with no penalty. One weakness is that the content was often confusing to me in lectures, but that could just be a personal issue of comprehension."
97553,"Strengths: the office hours were extremely helpful, the professor was extremely receptive to feedback about the lectures, twice a week was a great time frame, we were often encouraged to solve the problems for ourselves by the professor which helped us develop our intuition for the concepts weakness: the lecture notes could definitely be improved (they weren't always entirely clear), more practice problems could be given"
97553,It was very helpful to have multiple sessions of office hours spread out throughout the week. I think it was also very helpful that the lecture notes were posted because that made it easy to go back and review. I think the lectures themselves would sometimes be a little bit hard for me to follow in the sense that I felt I would often have to refer to other sources to fully understand concepts.
97553,It's a good course already.
97553,"I think the concept of this class was good--having a multivariable calculus class centered on applications instead of purely theory. But the class was not especially engaging and the format of one midterm and one final left fewer opportunities for reinforcing knowledge--perhaps more, shorter assignments would be better. I also felt that compared with other math or physics classes, there was less support--fewer office hours and review sessions."
97553,"Strengths: The class discussed several important topics in a way that progressed naturally. Problem Sets are built upon content covered in class, allowing the content to be applied and not just simply put out.   Weaknesses: Lecture notes were hard to read/follow at times. Many steps (and explanations) were skipped or not explained which made them difficult to comprehend. Besides the time spent processing the content, I needed to spend time to just understand what was being said intuitively. To improve this, notes could be written more in-depth. (This does not mean just mean more derivations, but just focusing on the logic/intuition behind each step). In addition to this, at times, there was an in-balance between making sense of equations and applying them to examples. At the beginning of the class, there was a lot of time spent on just deriving equations which made it difficult to intuitively understand them or see how they worked in equations. Although as we progressed, there was less time spent on derivations and more on examples, it resulted in there being close to no time spent on intuitively making sense of what the equations mean."
97553,Grading was done relatively fast and there was lots of time to ask questions.
97553,This course had the skill of being very supportive and informative for the students.
97553,"Strengths: Professor Puri is a good lecturer and was always willing to help or offer clarifications; her problem sets and exams were very fair; she doesn't want the class to feel stressful for students, but you still do learn a lot || Weaknesses: problem sets sometimes took a while to get graded, but this is a minor complaint"
97553,"It was very informative, I dont know how it could be improved."
97553,Could use better organization
97553,I think it needs 2 midterms not just 1
97553,"i really like the application based nature of the class. sometimes it felt like we were going really fast, but i think that's just the nature of college level calculus classes"
97553,"It is a lot of information in a short amount of time. It would be better to give it more time, especially since this course is known to be one of the harder mth classes"
97554,problem sets were mostly interesting. Its nice that you can drop 2 PSETs.
97554,"I think the course was taught very well and I came into the course dreading it and I actually very much enjoyed class and felt I learned extremely well from it. The professor is very good at explaining concepts and teaching the material. The homework was representative of the material covered in the class.   I felt the tests were designed to be far too complicated compared to the material on the psets and lectures. The class is curved (first exam average 71%, second exam average 64% so it has to be) but the distribution we were given essentially had the average being the cutoff between a B and B-. I have done just below average on exams and very well on problem sets and feel strange since I feel I have a very good grasp of the concepts covered, but that my grade will be low due to overcomplicated tests.  Additionally the exams are 4 questions long and on the second exam there was material on 1-2 questions that was from chapters of the book and problem sets we were told the exam wouldn't cover and much of the class hadn't studied those parts.   I would be giving this class flying colors in terms of instruction and the class overall if it was curved with the average having a higher letter grade cutoff or if the exams were designed to be more representative of the material on the problem sets. This was a class I enjoyed taking, it is just frustrating to be in a low grade range and feel I have done a great job with mastering material."
97554,"Strengths some TAs and peer tutors were very helpful Weaknesses lectures were unclear, hard to follow, and not helpful. The exams were not representative of class material and homework"
97554,"Lecture was not effectively done throughout the class, problem sets were not reflective of tested material, and exams were so distinct from material covered in class."
97554,this was not a great course. I feel like the lectures were structured in a manner entirely non conducive to learning. The only strength of this course was the peer tutoring.
97554,The lectures are very dense and so is the textbook. The content is simply not that interesting or applicable so it is hard to stay focused.
97554,"This course simply tries to cover too much material. It moves too fast and every single week there are three new topics or strategies we cover. I feel like our understanding of the material would be greatly increased if we just focused on a little less material. I think the instruction was good, but it expected us to pull a lot of our own weight to learn that quantity of really complex material. Especially since this course is just a prerequisite and is taken in tandem with many other demanding courses in engineering majors, it is unreasonably difficult and time consuming. The problem sets made sense in terms of difficulty, but the exams would choose the hardest cases to test us on."
97554,maybe more practice during class
97554,"Well taught course. Just very hard and takes more than once to get most of the material. Could have had more engagement with the class, perhaps a project?"
97554,Its literally so hard
97554,"This professor could have been improved in numerous ways, and one of them is being open about the goal of the class"
97554,"The course had a lot of information per lecture and the psets were very hard. There was a lot of resources for help from peer tutors and TAs, but the course went too fast sometimes."
97554,"Strengths: great textbook alongside good lectures facilitated a deep understanding of the concepts, homework assignments were engaging, professor and TA's were very willing to help.   Weaknesses: the material in chapter 10 felt a little bit crammed, perhaps we could move a little bit faster earlier in the course or cover 1-2 fewer sections in the previous chapters. Also exam questions did not necessarily match style or difficulty of problem set questions."
97554,"Strengths: well structured class, covered a lot of material in depth, professor was funny and engaging Weaknesses: none to be honest, class got the job done."
97554,Taught too fast and I think tests were unfairly hard.
97554,"I think the pace could have been faster near the beginning and slower at the end, given the ramping difficulty over time of the course"
97554,"I really liked Sohrab. I think he was a great lecturer and tried his best to keep the content interesting. He talked about the real world applications pretty frequently. His handwriting was scribbly at times but all in all I really learned a lot from this class. It was hard, but based on previous reviews this is about as good as it could have gone. The exams were absolutely brutal though, the first midterm average was a 71, second midterm was a 64, and the final average was a 60. I learned a lot even though it was hard."
97554,Lots of problems to solve Problems arent similar to final exams which the professor told us in the beginning  Interesting course materials
97554,Just the way it was set up was terrible. Learning nothing in lecture. Terrible teaching. Going to class was literally a waste of time. Super unclear and he would always make mistakes in the slides. Hes literally was copying slides from the textbook not even writing the math down on a board and still couldnt copy the slides correct. So many errors. Pretty bad experience do not reccomend. Note to all students the professor you take the class with really really matters in your overall experience.
97554,Strengths: The professor made things engaging and as fun as possible.  Weaknesses: The content wasn't my favorite and I basically just took it as a requirement. The lectures weren't always clear and went through a lot of content in the last 2 weeks but this is partly my fault for not reading the textbook before class as recommended.
97554,"It is very frustrating studying for exams with the resources you have (the textbook and lectures) just to go to an exam and discover that the professor has decided to put a modification of the types of problems you learned in class and on problem sets into the exam, so most of your studying was just a waste of time. The exams were just so demoralizing. You can study 20h for an exam and still do rubbish. It was just a horrible horrible class for one's mental health."
97554,"Strengths: The course did a good job of covering all of the essential techniques for solving and understanding differential equations. Sohrab was a good instructor who taught clearly and kept the classes engaging and entertaining. He kept a good balance between theoretical understanding of the material and learning practical techniques for solving equations. The midterm formula sheet competitions were a lot of fun, and it was always entertaining to see the formula sheets. Most importantly, I truly learned a lot in this class about differential equations, and feel prepared for future classes where I might need to use this knowledge. Weaknesses: Sometimes Sohrab went through derivations and proofs rather quickly, while I think spending more time on them could have helped me understand the material better. Students should also be aware that although the problem sets start out relatively simple, they get relatively more challenging and time-consuming over the course of the class."
97554,A strength was the organization of the course as it followed a very logical progression from one topic to the next that facilitated learning and applying the content. The homework related directly to classwork so helped students master the content in a challenging but very fair way. More office hours hosted by the professor would improve students learning ability.
97554,"Strengths: the material itself is very interesting and applications very relevant to engineering, especially towards the last half of the class. Weaknesses: lack of transparency in the grading philosophy, exams were very theoretical/proof-based even though this is a class for engineers, lectures were too fast to the point where students often left lecture more confused than entering it."
97554,"A lot of concepts, we covered by going through the proofs of the concept. Although this can oftentimes be interesting, this is not how I learned best, and rarely helped me understand how to apply concepts to answering questions. I would have preferred if we had spent more time going over questions and how to apply the concepts to a solution. I felt like I understood what was going on, but then when it came to Psets and exams, I didn't know where to start."
97554,"Very fast paced, but I think this is inherent to the structure of the course being comprised of both ordinary and partial diff eqs. Strength: engaging and patient professor and TAs, active on ed-discussion, teaching staff open to suggestions from students. Lots of available help and support."
97554,"I know there is a lot of material to get through, but I think if somehow the pace could be reduced just slightly and some formatting elements of the course remained consistent, it would be much improved. Towards the beginning, there are many slides that summarize how to do certain procedures that I would regularly reference when trying to do the homework or study the material. These slides got harder to find moving later into the course as I got lost and found myself unable to catch up, so it would be nice if slides like this were highlighted as summary slides, and if they were more consistently included especially for more difficult topics like series."
97554,Lecture slides for this course were organized very well. I do not have any weakness that I can think of for this course.
97571,"Strengths: different approach to art history; teaches you to see the world in a new way; section takes place in the YUAG and you get to actually interact with the objects which is super cool Weaknesses: lectures get pretty dry about halfway through the semester, and they all follow the same outline; sometimes it can be hard to tell which info is important for exam review and which is just interesting to know"
97571,"I think the course is a good survey, but I think the lectures could be better organized for learning. Sometimes they were a bit tangential and all over the place and it was hard to synthesize and absorb material."
97571,"Engaging lectures. Sections were really interesting at first (cool to see and handle objects up close) but got a little repetitive as the semester went on. I think that a more critical approach could be taken with regards to art collection (i.e. the YUAG's acquisition and holding of objects) and the field of art history more generally: there was a whole lecture on art collecting & museums as imperial projects, but the YUAG's role in this was not addressed."
97571,"I cannot think of any particular weaknesses of this course. Professor Cooke never relied too heavily on the powerpoints which was great to keep students engaged. I believe that the class was incredibly well structured, focusing first on understanding the materials of object and later learning the objects themselves."
97571,"Strengths: The course is very well-organized. The expectations for each assignment and exam are clear. I felt prepared going into every assignment/exam. The pacing of the course was also great. I liked that the first half of the semester focused on the processes of making objects and the second half focused on the connection between different objects. The course builds well on itself, and I felt engaged the whole time.  Weaknesses: None!"
97571,The sections in the YUAG were this class greatest strength. It was also great to learn from an expert like professor Cooke but nothing compares to working with and handling the objects themselves in the collections of the art gallery.
97571,The lectures were really good and then getting to do section in the art gallery and interact with objects was such a great experience.
97571,"The discussion sections were not facilitated in a way that were super useful. No one took notes, but then the objects from section would be on the exams."
97571,"This course changes tone and direction at midterm, focused in the first half of the semester on knowledge acquisition and the second half on global networks of exchange. The first half is much more compelling. The second half recycles objects and themes quite often, often making lectures redundant. Moreover, slides are often labeled with very little text (or text that says nothing about an object besides its tombstone information--devoid of thematic significance) or long-form, extraneous content. Both make for a frustrating student. experience. This course could benefit from a curricular redesign and refreshed educational materials."
97571,I really liked the sections in the art gallery and how they were hands on. The only thing was you didnt really know what you needed to know in lecture.
97571,"Strengths: Dedicated professor, good overview, fair and creative assessments  Weaknesses: It was a lot of content and information to take in each week, and I wonder if each topic could have more of a narrative or if Prof. Cooke could choose a smaller selection of objects to discuss in greater depth--sometimes it felt like he provided lots and lots of examples without much structure and they were hard to remember"
97571,I very much enjoyed the different assignment types and structure/organization of this course. I also loved the way our sections were run as they allowed me to build upon my knowledge base from lecture.
97571,"Section is a big strength of the course, allowing students to engage with objects first hand."
97571,I thought that all of the TAs and the Professor (Prof. Cooke) were incredibly kind and reasonable with grading. I think one area of improvement would be some more guided/structured sections. Not every section lined up with what objects we looked at during lecture m.
97571,Section was amazing. You get to hands-on look at and touch objects every section in the YUAG
97571,"Strength: Well-designed sections, knowledgable professor, fresh topic of class Weakness: Not really"
97571,"Strengths: engagement with YUAG collections + Professor Cooke's own collection, Professor Cooke's expertise and obvious passion for the subject, material itself (very interesting course, unlike anything else you will really take)  Weaknesses: sections could get a little bit repetitive, course itself was more organized towards the beginning of the semester as opposed to the end; readings were LENGTHY and it was hard to tell what was important and what wasn't by virtue of the reading list... found some readings to be a bit technical and unnecessary given the ""survey"" nature of the class."
97571,"Great lectures, sections are a ton of fun in the YUAG."
97571,Loved the slide format and the sections which provided time to actually interact with the objects we talked about
97571,"I loved this course!!   Strength: The sections were my favorite part and, by engaging with the objects in the YUAG, I really got to understand them in a way that one cant from just 2D pictures. The lectures were interesting, as well, and provided a wealth of information that we could put to use as we held and discussed the objects in section."
97571,"This course is very thorough which can at times be overwhelming when taking notes. This is not a major weakness, just a note."
97571,"The first half of the class on technique and material is pretty dry, but the second half is super interesting. It would be nice if we were given more detailed handouts in section regarding the objects we interacted with"
97571,"The lectures were for the most part very interesting and engaging and the discussion sections in the YUAG were incredible. Being able to apply what we learned in lecture to real objects that we could handle ourselves just made the class material so much more real. I have to say that there was kind of an odd low point in the middle of the semester where there were two or three lectures whose content felt kind of redundant with each other, but after that the class picked up again and each lecture felt unique and engaging, so overall I'd say the weaknesses were very few."
97571,"For a lecture, this course is extremely engaging. Professor Cooke brings objects from his own collection to class so students can interact directly with the materials they are learning about. Section, which is conducted almost entirely in the object study rooms in the YUAG, gives students further opportunity to interact with objects from both Professor Cooke's collection and the museum itself while also driving intellectual discussion about the objects and honing their object analysis skills. The making exercise and the final label bring the whole course into perspective by reframing materials and practices that seem something of an older age into a modern context. The only suggestion I have for this course is the implementation of weekly discussion posts. The intention here would be for them to be graded on participation, with only a certain number being required by the end of the semester, but for students to be able to practice their material literacy in a more informal capacity where they can still receive feedback from the TFs and even their peers."
97571,"This course has very interesting lectures, although lecture slides to not contain words about what was discussed so if you miss a lecture it is hard to make up what you missed. Discussion sections are very unique to this class because you are able to touch objects and explore the YUAG."
97571,"strengths: you maybe only need to read two of the readings that they give out for the entire course, just actually take good notes during lecture/lecture recordings, trust me, I got an A on the midterm with only two readings behind me. at a certain point I forgot they existed. because he had a staggered upload schedule, i'd watch one lecture recording and go to one lecture in person every week. the making assignment was really cool. a good way to start a new skill as well!  weaknesses: seemed to be two camps of TFs that you'd get for sections. either super intimidating or friendly. just a luck of the draw. but the intimidating ones were incredibly intimidating. which, this was kind of a strength if your response to this is to come super prepared. even if you come super prepared you still end up with a solid undercurrent of fear, but it did make me pay more attention for lecture. sessions weren't really a place to not know or ask questions, it was where all your non exam grades would come in. so you had to know, be correct, and use the correct vocabulary, not only the correct concept, in order to get your grade."
97595,"I enjoyed most of the readings and discussion sections but felt like there was far to much reading assigned on a weekly basis to go in depth into the material. Also some lectures were interesting and others had a lot of information that could have been conveyed in a more interesting manner. I liked the final project setup with the presentation and freedom to explore topics covered in class.   It was hard to get feedback on assignments for aspects to include in projects and writing and there were no grading standards posted.   In terms of grading, we have received feedback on only the project proposal worth 10%. We've submitted 60% worth of other assignments including the Not I, participation, discussion sections projects, presentation and haven't gotten grades back so ending finals period I have no idea what my grade is like in this course which is fairly frustrating, it would have been nice to get a mid semester or final week progress on how the grading was looking like as it made it impossible to see if the course should be taken on Credit D Fail basis or for a grade."
97595,loved it so informative
97595,"The grading between TF's is not consistent; some grade much harsher than others. Also, there is very minimal instruction about the group project which is 40% of the grade. Everything in this class is just so vague; it makes it so hard to be successful or see improvement in yourself over the course of the semester."
97595,"I think the lectures were very interesting, but the real strength came from the TA Alex. He ran such an engaging section and was clearly so knowledgeable and approachable. He really mentored the students and made sure everyone reached their full potential. I think the lack of guidance around what the assignments are meant to look like is a bit of a weakness. There was never a clear explanation of what the final product of assignments should look like because they were so open-ended and I found that unnecessarily challenging."
97595,"Strengths: animated lectures, interesting topics"
97595,"The readings and discussion sections were not engaging at all, a lot of the content was just boring in general."
97595,"The readings were really interesting, but lectures were sometimes chaotic"
97595,This course thoughtfully integrates structured curriculum with a research project that gives students the chance to conduct independent study about a spatial infrastructure or episode that interests them.
97595,This class was great.
97595,Very abstract and hard to follow
97595,I thought the lectures were weird and it was tough to follow along
97595,"The strength of this course lied with my TF, Alex Kim. Without his guidance through the complicated topics of our lectures and readings, this class would have had little to no learning value for me."
97595,"The course is very open to explore any avenues that you find interesting through the essay and Pecha Kucha. The class gives you a good framework to think about a lot of issues. However, it does feels as if Keller Easterling is mostly reading her book through the lecture."
97595,"Course had a lot of interesting content, but I thought it was slightly disorganized."
97595,"Strength - gut, chill professor and TAs Weakness - you get what you put in"
97595,The course was strong in its breadth of topics covered but can be confusing to understand at times
97595,"Strengths: the readings are well chosen and interesting (sometimes far too long though) Weaknesses: lectures are extremely un-engaging and there is very little reason to be motivated to do any work. Consequently, you barely learn anything and leave very unfullfilled"
97595,"The lectures hop from example to example and expect you to draw foundational concepts from them instead of clearly walking you through a smaller number of examples, which might facilitate student learning. The readings were consistently fascinating, but the lectures were often very hard to follow. Discussion section was great and very necessary for student understanding/discussion. Expectations for the first assignment were extremely unclear (although I think everyone got an A on it)."
97662,Textbook reading a little too heavy
97662,"The content of this course was really interesting, but sometimes the language/terminology was just so difficult for a non-STEM major to understand"
97662,"Strengths: Well organized, interesting"
97662,I enjoyed Professor Kenney's use of synchronous participation in class. That helped with student engagement. The course was well organized into three different sections.
97662,"Strengths: Prof. Kenney's lectures are engaging and fun! Even when the content felt confusing or a little boring, Kenney would catch our attention with funny slides or in-class demonstrations. This course is very accessible to everyone. Even though students might assume this class is a ""gut,"" the structure of the course made it feel like an introductory astronomy and astrophysics course, just with a very understanding professor and sympathetic grading. I never felt like the class was easy or a throw-away lecture; instead, this class's broad focus builds a really strong foundation in this topic area. Additionally, the observatory extra credit excursion was SO COOL! Weaknesses: Lectures are not recorded in order to encourage in-class attendance and participation - this made me feel more motivated to attend lectures, but this could be inconvenient when students were sick or had conflicts. The midterm was pretty difficult in terms of the time constraints and tedious calculation questions, but Kenney graded the midterm with a very forgiving curve."
97662,I loved the textbook.
97662,"The course has interesting content, however I would say a weakness is the lack of similarity in the lectures and the homework/test content. Oftentimes on the homework I had no idea how to begin even though I attended every lecture."
97662,"Not a beginner class, would appreciate demonstrations of example homework problems in class."
97662,"Each lecture could be 50 minutes instead of an hour 15, as many students appear to loose focus in the middle of class. There's a lot of information crammed into each slide, which is useful for review, but harder for students to take in during class. It would be great if the professor could give us access to the slides beforehand, or record the lectures."
97662,I really liked the observation opportunity and the psets were good practice
97662,"The lectures were poorly organizeda lot of the slides were repeated every class. Also the psets tested problems that we never went through in class, the lecture material was pretty irrelevant to them."
97662,lectures are more confusing than helpful. learned the most reviewing the slides by myself.
97662,"Strengths: Professor Kenney was a very engaging lecturer, and I liked that there were elements of participation in the class it definitely helped me pay more attention and understand the concepts.  Weaknesses: I wish we had spent more time doing example problems with the various formulae we had to learn instead of being thrown into the PSETs with little understanding of them (however, the sections/office hours were very helpful for this, I just wish we did it in class too)."
97663,"It's fun, but the psets are not always easy"
97663,"STRENGTHS: - Course material is incredibly interesting. - The course culminates in a message that we send to space, (hopefully) contacting aliens. This was really cool, and the students got a say in exactly what message we would transmit and what star we would transmit to. - Faison is funny and quite engaging.  WEAKNESSES: - Psets were a bit vague at times. Sometimes they would require clarification from TFs in order to determine specifically what they were asking.  - Ed could've been more useful. I felt like it was mostly an afterthought, whereas in other courses, it's been much more helpful.  - Lectures were often disorganized. Most of my learning in this class came from the readings or googling for psets rather than the lectures it seemed."
97663,"I loved this course! Starting with the astronomy component made the course really interesting, and Professor Faison made the biology part easier to understand. I have to say that making the problem sets due at 11pm on Friday rather than Saturday made it a little difficult for me to balance time, but the late policy was reasonable."
97663,"The topics discussed were very interesting, as well as the problem sets. However, the grading/expectation on midterms was a little bit harsh, or not clear beforehand."
97663,"Strengths include occasional really interesting material about the universe and our place in it. Weaknesses include confusing lectures, problem-sets that are unrelated to lecture/reading content, and tough grading on exams."
97663,"A strength is the topic itself, however, a big weakness is that it's formatted as a lecture. I feel like as it's more a topic of debate among scientists and critics alike, it'd be best adapted as a seminar."
97663,"The PSET results come out pretty late. I am currently writing this one day before the actual final exam, and my PSET 10 grades had just been released."
97663,I think that this course could be improved by having more clear lecture slides and notes.
97663,"Strengths: naturally interesting material, great structure and order of the topics covered, kind lateness policy, psets and exams were amazing (not that type of hard that leaves you nauseous and hating the class, they were actually easy and mostly asked for clarity, logic, personal reflection, and creativity), kind TAs that help with psets during discussion sections. I genuinely enjoyed doing ever single assignment in this class. Weaknesses: the lecture presentations are non-informative (mostly just photos/pictures), and the lectures are not recorded. That's probably a single consistent stressor I experienced in this class. The grading is somewhat nit-picky, and assignments are often returned much later, but that wasn't too much of a concern to me."
97663,"Strengths - Michael Faison is a great, engaging professor who truly cares about the students. He invited us to see the Venus, Mars, and a star cluster up at the observatory one night as well. He is always excited to share new astronomy news with us in class.  Weaknesses - Sometimes, the teaching fellows would not show up to sections or would not show up on time."
97663,"The content was interesting, and the TFs were very attentive. I think the class failed to teach us the mathematics needed to complete the problem sets, which was frustrating. It was not intuitive. Other than that, I felt the class was well-formatted."
97663,"The inherent content is quite interesting, and Michael Faison can be fun to listen to lecture, but the important content of the class is a bit lacking. Faison doesn't put any words on his slides, and so accessing them later to compare with your notes isn't an option. Additionally, almost every question on every single problem set requires you to look up answers online, resulting in paying attention in class having almost no impact on how you do on the problem sets. This ultimately leads me to ask the question: Why am I spending two hours a week in a class when most of what I'm learning (and then applying on the exams) just comes from the internet? Why take this course if most of the assignments tell me ""look on Google"" and then *that's* what's on the exam. I appreciate that the class is trying to match the times, as I think the internet is a great resource and should be utilized more in assignments, but not exclusively and in lieu of learning content in class. Additionally, the fact that problem sets all relied on self-research online turned them less into a learning experience/applying my knowledge and more into a chore I had to work out in two hours through various Google tabs."
97663,"Strengths: manageable problem sets that reflected what we covered in readings, really interesting subject matter. Exams are well structured and I think that Faison really cares about his students having a positive experience and not being too stressed out while also learning a lot  Cons: Faison's lectures, while warm and engaging, sometimes deviated from the topics we were supposed to be covering that day. The one place I would say this course was seriously lacking was with the TA's -- there were several weeks where I showed up to section and the TA wouldn't know what questions we were asking or wouldn't have looked at the problem set, which was mainly why students were there."
97663,"Only weaknesses are what I can recall from this course, those including spending a minimum of 30 minutes covering ""relevant"" news that did not correlate with our lessons, receiving PSET grades late and having a disorganized structure."
97663,"Strengths:  very interesting content, unique course, I feel like I genuinely learned a lot of new information about the subject, the exams were mostly fair, brief, and graded well. The course emphasized student curiosity rather than memorization.   Weaknesses:  I found the grading system very stressful to a degree that it made me enjoy the course much less. The problem sets were incredibly time consuming and made up of very subjective questions that would get points deducted if they were not answered in a certain way. There was also barely any preparation provided to students before the exams that made it very stressful and difficult to study for them. Thirdly, the course content makes some assumptions about students having a background in some physics and chemistry and does not review concepts in these fields, making it much more difficult for students who do not have a strong background in these subjects to understand the reasoning behind course concepts."
97663,Strengths are content. Weaknesses are due date of assignments.
97663,The weekly assigned readings seemed not to match the problem set questions greatly and some wouldn't of the asked about topics wouldn't be hit on in lecture in the same detail needed for the problem sets. I found myself having to do a decent amount of outside research but other than that I thought the lecture and amount learned overall was fulfilling.
97663,"The biggest strength of this course, to me at least, was how engaging lecture was. Not only was I interested in the content, but Professor Faison's use of both puns and amazing images of interstellar nebula further pulled me in. The assigned readings also went a long way with broadening our understanding of the material, and there were always optional readings that further delved into specific subjects for those who wanted to know more - from Ben Affleck teaching about whale evolution to theories on how we would travel through black holes."
97663,"The course material is fascinating, and the readings are mostly simple to understand and engaging. The lectures themselves, however, are the biggest detriment to the course. The lectures feel disorganized and disengaging. It doesn't feel like we are covering the material adequately within lecture."
97663,"Strengths: Great teacher, interesting material, engaging environment. Weaknesses: This is not really a weakness, but weekly problem sets took a lot of time to complete. Either shortening each problem set or reducing the number of problem sets would help a lot. Moreover, the slides were not helpful at all. They mostly contained pictures, and I rarely used the slides to prepare for exams. Adding some text would be helpful."
97663,"Strengths: the course is really interesting and easy to grasp for non-science majors. The topics we cover are really cool and I genuinely feel like I learned a lot from this class. Professor Faison does a great job keeping students engaged. Weaknesses: the scope of the course is so broad, so some classes sometimes don't feel as relevant to the focus of the class."
97663,"The course topic was interesting, but it was somewhat disorganized and hard to stay on track"
97663,The lectures are not very organized and the problem sets arent based off of things covered in lecture. A more direct correlation would make the class easier to follow. Also the exams and problem sets arent graded consistently answers close to the correct ones still get points taken off.
97663,"I often felt that the questions on problem sets were open ended, but the grading for problem sets was too strict/was looking for a more specific set of answers."
97663,I loved the lectures and the lecturer but the PSET was a bit exhausting every week. It ensured I memorized the material though.
97663,"Strengths: interesting topic, and Faison can be humorous sometimes. I also enjoyed the more ""hands on"" parts of class, like getting to go to the observatory and see what we learned about in action. Weakness: lectures are a little bit unorganized, and it would be nice if they were also recorded."
97663,"Strengths: Good reading list, not a horrible workload, relatively interesting content.  Weaknesses: The P-sets, lectures, and tests. P-sets: Professor Faison often tried to include math on the p-sets, but he wasn't good at explaining the simple equations involved in physics and astronomy to a non-STEM audience. Almost every single math problem was impossible to understand, never mind solve, without going to office hours. Most required additional information that we were either expected to figure out on our own or know already. Additionally, the p-set questions almost always required us to look up information that wasn't included in either the readings or the lectures. In fact, content from the lectures rarely showed up on the p-sets, and the lectures themselves weren't great. Professor Faison made a valiant attempt at engaging the class by spending the first 20 minutes of every lecture discussing whatever recent astronomical event happened to be in the news, but since most kids were just taking the class for the science credit, no one was interested in paying attention to an irrelevant topic that wouldn't show up on the tests or p-sets. I think students would have been more engaged with this section of the course if Prof. Faison tried to initiate a debate or ask us about extraterrestrial life, rather than astronomical phenomena that requires a high degree of subject knowledge to understand and discuss intelligently. We almost never got through all of the lecture material, and the slides never had any words or lecture notes on them---which is testament to Faison's skill as a lecturer, but made it difficult to follow what he was saying or take notes later. Attending lecture honestly ended up feeling like a waste of time since I knew I would have to google or look through the textbook for the information I needed for the p-sets anyways. The tests, though generously graded, were also way too short to be fair. Each was only 4 questions long. Given the amount of content the course covered, it's crazy that a subject you studied may or may not have shown up on the tests simply because of dumb luck. The p-sets were the main method by which I learned the content, since they were so long. I ended up spending close to 10 hours on each of them. Again, that seems like a bizarre way to design a course; this means that most of what I learned was by self-teaching. I feel like I went above and beyond what was required for the p-sets; I can't imagine another student who didn't put as much effort in as I did coming out of this course having learned anything much."
97663,"Professor Faison's lecture style was incredibly confusing. He would often try to adopt a socratic method where he'd ask questions and open it up to the class to answer, but this was flawed in several ways. Firstly, by having student answers drive the lecture, it meant that the explanation of any given subject wasn't necessarily done in the most conducive way to a newcomer understanding it; rather it followed whatever responses students had given, which may end up resulting in a topic being taught circuitously. Secondly, Professor Faison often assumed that if one student answered something correctly, that the whole class could follow that student's logic, which isn't necessarily the case. Another major weakness was that especially at the start of the course there were massive amounts of reading that overlapped 80-90% with the lecture, so it frankly felt like a waste of my time to read, but occasionally we were actually expected to have found those random nuggets of new information on our own. In terms of strengths, the subject matter itself was quite interesting and the psets and exams felt fairly manageable."
97663,"Sometimes the lectures felt a bit shallow/didnt really go into much depth and were repetitive, but the professor is really great and covers so much."
97663,A lot of the questions on the p-set just required us to google stuff. Some of the readings weren't available on canvas.
97663,"Strengths: Dr. Faison was great and knows so much about the topic, and his lectures were incredibly interesting/engaging  Weaknesses: Problem Sets were largely just poring through a few sources in search of long, written answers. The sources were interesting to read for someone interested in astronomy (like me) but it was often tedious and took a while to find answers."
97663,"Strengths of the course are the clearly laid out units and how the course is divided into three sections, each of which has an accompanying exam. I think that the workload of the course was well-balanced and doable. Weaknesses of the course are the sometimes useless time in class during lectures. At times I found it more useful to read the textbook and watch the professor's recommended YouTube videos than to go to the actual lecture."
97663,"Faison was an incredible lecturer, if a bit disorganized chaos style"
97663,"Some interesting facts, some was funny. Other parts felt like random details rather than cohesive"
97663,"I felt like the material on the problem sets was often unrelated to what was in lecture (and harder). We were told to try to reason things out using concepts, but often it was difficult to do this with mathematical problems."
97663,"Strength: incredibly interesting and informative, and it got me to fall in love with astronomy. Weakness: there should be comprehensive study guides so that you can recollect what youve covered during the course easier"
97663,"Strengths: very interesting content, especially in the second half of the course, and Prof. Faison is a very entertaining lecturer  Weaknesses: Prof. Faison is also not a very organized lecturerlectures jump from topic to topic and it was hard to tell what information was important and what was tangential. Also the psets took ages to be graded."
97663,Its a fascinating class that helps non-STEM majors get excited about science. Pset questions are sometimes very subjective and vague and it was not clear what the graders were looking for making it hard to get points.
97663,Loved the session at Leitner at the end
97663,"There are only strengths. Doctor Faison's classes are incredibly inspiring and thought provoking. Problem sets and assigned readings are short and reasonable. The assigned reading is actually incredibly interesting. There are short problem sets every week, ten in total. The problem sets are more difficult than the tests, and designed exactly that way so that if you know the problem sets, you're sure to do well on the tests. Regarding the tests, they are three things... short, reasonable, and fair (fair in terms of content, expectations, and grading). The design of the course alone makes it is clear that Doctor Faison is setting his students up for success and very much cares about his students. Further proof of this are the three discussion sections each week (voluntary, you don't have to go!) where TFs help students understand the concepts taught that week. Additionally, Doctor Faison has office hours three times(!) each week on Zoom. To excel in this course, all you need to do is come to class, and do the problem sets and the assigned readings. If something stumps you that week, you have six opportunities to get help outside of class every week, plus a discussion board where you can ask other students questions at any time. Advice: Study the problem set solutions when they come out and make sure you understand them, you'll be sure to pass with flying colors if you do this! Also, if you do take this class, please be active on the class discussion board! It is there to help you and your fellow students!! Again, there are no weaknesses. It is an incredible class!!!"
97670,I don't think this class was taught in the greatest way. I think the slides could have been more clear and I found myself just scrambling to write down the codes in class without understanding what each line did. The content was confusing to me.
97670,"Strengths: I quite enjoyed the content in this course. At first, I was not too excited to learn Matlab, but by the end of the semester, I was fascinated by what I could do with the program. Dr. Mak is a strength of this course--he is consistently accessible for office hours, and does a great job of answering student questions. Another strength of this course is the problem sets, as they helped me rigorously engage with the content in the course. One final strength is the practice exams, as they are exactly like the midterm and final, so there were no curveballs or unexpected ""gotcha"" questions. Weaknesses: The main weakness of this course is that it is very dry. I think this is in part unavoidable when teaching Matlab from scratch, but I think this could be fixed by moving more quickly through the first half of the course, and spending more time on the second half of the course. The first half of the course was extremely boring, especially since many people had at least some coding experience. The second half, however, was considerably more difficult--but more enjoyable and fascinating--and I think the course could improve a lot by expanding more on the second half (chemical reactions, Brownian motion, etc.)."
97670,The difficulty of the course ramped up very quickly after the midterm.
97670,"As part of the additional help provided, extra questions were created and posted on canvas. However, the answers to these extra questions were not posted. As such, the potential for the extra questions to help was extremely limited."
97670,"The lecture material could feel slow, or dry at times. But, I feel that this was the best way to learn a new programing language. I'd never used matlab before, but now feel very comfortable with the language."
97670,"Strengths: Computational skills are a must in this day and age, and this course was a very approachable introduction to these skills. Prof. Mak did a great job integrating practical tasks with teaching coding fundamentals. Additionally, ample support was provided, with plentiful office hours and TA sessions.  Weaknesses: Learning coding in lecture format can be a bit dull sometimes, but this is more the nature of the subject rather than a shortcoming in any teaching capacities."
97670,"I thought that, towards the end of the course, the psets were incredibly difficult, and the allotted time to finish them was not enough to properly learn the information. Overall, I found that I learned a lot of coding, however, and that the course was very good for learning the logic behind coding in MATLAB."
97670,"This course taught me the skills I need to model and analyze data using matlab. However, the lectures were often hard to pay attention to and could be made more interesting."
97670,"A strength of this course is that its structure of the content (i.e., the units the course is split up into) makes sense, such that at the end of the course, completing the final project which models a biological system is simply a matter of combining the basic parts together into one model. The pacing is also very approachable.   One improvement I think could be made is in how some demo codes are presented. Though it could be difficult, it would be useful to show that oftentimes, several different logical structures could work for the purpose of the function being constructed."
97670,The material is very dry and its hard to remain focused during lectures. The TFs were not very responsive to emails and neither were they very helpful when it came to problem sets. The second half of the course is significantly harder than the first half and much of the material was rushed through toward the end. The slides were also not very helpful for exam prep. The final project is very time consuming (even though its worth only 5% of your grade!) and working on that took a lot of time away from studying for the final.
97670,"I struggled a good amount given that I had no coding experience, but I'm not exactly sure how it could have been improved given the amount of content we had to cover in a limited amount of time. I think I was given a good amount of resources but I just needed more time. It could have been nicer providing written explanations of what certain commands in MATLAB meant so that reviewing codes after class would be more straightforward."
97670,Wish it was a full year course. All of the really exciting stuff came at the end
97670,I think that the office hours offered by Prof Mak was a highlight of the course as he always made time for students and was extremely kind and patient. I wish that the course itself was more engaging though as it was mainly just students copying code from a computer screen. I also wish we went over graphing models and interpretations a bit more.
97670,"Very fast paced, not engaging"
97673,"The strengths are that KMJ explains the material well and there are two sections you can attend which are helpful. Although KMJ is great, her class is extremely difficult. The biggest weakness is the midterm project. It is so long and we receive very little instruction on how to actually do the MATLAB part of it. The midterm project was over 20 pages long of so many calculations, explanations and MATLAB and excel plots and interpretations. It was so difficult and if you didn't devote your spring break to working on it, you were very behind. This should have been the final project in place of having a final. Do not underestimate how high the workload is in this class"
97673,"Overall a terrific class, and I really got a lot out of it. The only thing is sometimes I felt it was may be the tiniest bit disorganized Im really not impactful to the course at all"
97673,KMJ is a fantastic lecturer and the course is very interesting. My biggest suggestion for improvement would be to post annotated notes on Canvas as even if you take good notes in class it can still be very helpful to supplement with her notes for psets. Often on canvas the slides for a derivation were blank as they were done in class.
97673,"The course is taught very well, but it sometimes becomes difficult to understand how this content could be applied in a real world setting outside of academia. We learn a lot about how to apply differential equations to construct enzyme binding and diffusion models, but I'm still not entirely sure how I would use this knowledge. Even though the content was difficult, I still have the impression that I learned a very basic level of biological modeling, but I feel like this would only ever be used for modeling a system in academia. In terms of how the course is run, lectures are very engaging, and TF sections are helpful for figuring out how to do psets. However, it gets pretty frustrating that psets take so much time and work, but are only worth 15% of your grade."
97673,This is a very well-organized course and Prof. Miller-Jensen does a great job of teaching and running it. I do wish that psets would be a little more manageable without having to seek outside help - sometimes if we do attempt it alone we could waste a lot of time as opposed to waiting until office hours to set up the question.
97673,The professor is a massive strength as she make the material engaging and very applicable to the real world.
97673,The phrasing of several of the assignments is difficult to interpret both the intention of the question and what parameters we are/are not allowed to make.
97673,"Strengths: Prof KMJ is so knowledgeable, organized (!!), and understanding. Her lectures were very well structured and engaging. The material is very relevant and interesting.  Weaknesses: the PSETs are pretty difficult and time consuming (and nearly impossible to complete without friends and TFs), so it would be nice if they contributed more to our final grade. It was disappointing that the midterm project was worth more than all the PSETs combined, considering they took 5-10 hours each week to complete."
97673,"This course evaluates knowledge in many ways such as a project, problem sets, and exams. Also, there are many opportunities to interact with both the teachers and TFs."
97673,The class was well structured and the material was covered very well. I would say that the PSETs were very time consuming and that I wish they were worth more of our grade based on the amount of work we had to do for them.
97673,Strengths: Very interesting material. The information in the class is taught in an intuitive way.   Weakness: Probably some of the hardest psets I've done at Yale so far.
97673,This course was so much work and I definitely learned a lot but the psets and projects and exams were some of the most difficult at all. I think their was a lot on matlab that also made it hard. I think less matlab would make this course less stressful
97673,"Strengths: Dr. Miller-Jensen is an amazing instructor and she always ensures that people are caught up and understanding the class material by checking in and clarifying when people ask questions. The class material itself is very engaging and relevant for those interested in the molecular side of biomedical engineering.   Weaknesses: Psets are unnecessarily long, complicated, and unclear such that you cannot succeed unless you make it to TA sections every week. Expect to spend 5-10 hours a week on them. The Ed discussion portal was helpful but was not frequently updated, especially before exams."
97673,I believe that the grading distribution is a weakness given that the PSETS should be worth more than 15% of the overall grade as they are much more challenging than other classes. This class emphasizes exams which is a fair move but the reward of steady and consistent effort throughout the semester should also matter. A key strength of the course is the way in which Professor Miller-Jensen is highly engaging with the material and is always open to answering questions.
97676,The notes are really hard to follow in class and to look back on. Very easy switch would be to do a continuous scroll when writing down notes in class rather than turning the page quickly. I never had enough time to write everything down and it was very hard to stay engaged in lecture. The class and PSETs were really hard. It is nice though to have a class with Prof Duncan and Staib to get closer to the DUS and have them so accessible
97676,"strengths - grading seems to be relatively forgiving so you can focus on understanding the content, Prof. Duncan does a lot to try to make the course easier for students because the content is pretty difficult. Content-wise though, a considerable portion of it does overlap with things from physio or BENG 355L so you won't feel completely unprepared. weaknesses - lectures were REALLY unengaging and it was very difficult to maintain my attention."
97676,"The course structure is paced well, and examples given in class give an excellent demonstration of both conceptual and practical applications of each topic. One aspect I hope to see improved is a more thorough walk-through of PSET solutions after their submission."
97676,"Sometimes it was hard to understand their notes, but they are really nice and helpful"
97676,"Strengths: Taught by two professors who specialized in the topics that were discussed in class. Gave a varied approach to learning. The content was difficult, but help was always provided.  Weaknesses: Exam questions sometimes called for extremely different approaches than were discussed or provided earlier."
97676,"While the lectures in the course were not the most engaging, the professors and TFs provided ample information and notes on the topics in class as well as opportunities to ask questions."
97676,"Strengths: the TAs are very knowledgeable and helpful, we always got quick feedback on homework assignments. Weaknesses: lectures were not engaging, exams were very difficult, and there were no office hours held by the profs or TFs (except for once weekly section)"
97676,"Strengths: Great teaching, interesting material! This is definitely the more math-heavy side of the BME major but I thought it was so applicable given that all of the medical imaging and analysis that happens nowadays is based on computational operations like those we learn in this class. Prof. Staib and Prof. Duncan are both wonderful to talk to and clearly are very knowledgable about the field. Also, the TAs our year were wonderful and they had the best pset solutions that would walk you through a problem very clearly so you could learn from your mistakes.  Weaknesses: Sometimes the lectures were too fast and it was difficult to follow during lecture. Also, sometimes lectures were not that engaging and contained a lot of material that was not tested on, making studying for exams difficult. There was also a slight disconnect between what is taught in class and the psets - more integration would help reinforce concepts rather than forcing the student to rely on the TAs to teach entirely new concepts or methods."
97676,"The greatest strength of the class is the professors and TAs who are amazing at continuously answering questions, filling in the gaps of understanding. Another strength was the use of visual examples to better understand matrix convolution or other class concepts. A key way that the course could be improved is by having more real-world connections with how the material is used in industry or in current research literature."
97684,The TFs were not great.
97684,"Clearly presented, interesting concepts at a good pace. Asking questions is encouraged, and led to interesting side discussions. Paper reviews during the lecture brought good perspective to reading scientific literature."
97684,I think that the course was well taught. I liked Professor Kyrakides' teaching style - he was very engaging and was able to explain difficult concepts and difficult scientific papers in a way that was easy to follow. I wish that the rubric for the writing assignments were clearer and more specific.
97684,"strengths - theoretically low-stress writing assignments and open-note exams weaknesses - seemingly arbitrary point loss, no clarity in what we can improve on, extremely harsh grading seemingly only for the purpose of ""creating a grade distribution"""
97684,"I enjoyed how many real scientific articles were used in the course. I wanted more feedback on my work, especially on writing assignments where points seemed to be taken off quite arbitrarily."
97684,Exams did not feel like they tested how much you learned rather than if you were able to write down a really specific detail from class or read a vague question the right way. Strengths were that it was very interesting course and cool topics.
97684,I think this course introduced many interesting concepts and I have learned a lot.  The course could be better organized to make it more structured.
97684,This course covers are wide variety of topics in numerous application areas ranging for tissue engineering to diabetes to deep brain stimulation.
97684,"Strengths: Topics are very interesting, great integration the real world applications with the science  Weaknesses: Lectures are not recorded, rubric for the writing assignments are not clear, professor's wording is confusing to follow sometimes"
97684,"Strength: You get to learn a lot about biomaterials.  Weaknesses: Very poorly structured class. It was difficult to know what was going to be on the exams. In fact, it ended up being anything he might have said in class. This meant that keeping a detailed log of what he said in class was important in getting a good score in the class. This is also because 90% of the class grade was based on the exams."
97684,"The tests were hard and unpredictable , lectures were really interesting tho"
97684,"Strength: The course content is interesting and teaches you a lot about the immune response to and testing/approval process for medical implants. Prof. Kyriakides is very knowledgeable and enjoys interacting with and helping students. Weaknesses: The lecture slides don't make too much sense without attending lecture, which is good for motivating class attendance. However, the exam questions are based off of what Prof. Kyriakides verbally says in class, which makes it very difficult to do well on exams if you have to miss a lecture or accidentally lose attention in class."
97684,"Loved the lectures including actual research and very well explained. Really enjoyed the information in the class. The test questions could be more clearer. Atleast one question on the final required too much time to find the answers, the question was too specific with no clear direction if these were details found in the lectures or the papers mentioned. If it was in the papers, then the answer was not clarity found, requiring too much time on one question for a 2 hour test."
97684,"The course is fully lecture-based, which could be a strength or weakness depending on the learner. I personally really enjoy learning through lecture, and I found the lectures in this class to be better than most because they were primarily case studies that the professor would walk us through. If you have high interest in the course content, it isn't hard to stay engaged. Another strength is Professor Kyriakides' expertise; he knows the content like the back of his hand and can answer all sorts of questions. The open-note exam format was nice as it emphasized understanding the material (and showing up to lecture) rather than just memorization."
97684,The content was extremely interesting and it was taught in a very accessible way. I loved reading new papers and understanding the drawbacks of their approaches. The weakness was the lack of engagement of other students in the course.
97684,"One major strength is the teaching style, no weaknesses"
97684,"weaknesses: no clear feedback, expectations not made clear, grades felt made up, passive aggressiveness from both TAs and professor, professor not open to answering questions,"
97691,Great balance of mathematical theory and computational modeling.
97691,Emonet should teach first. We are already overwhelmed at the end of the term and 4 others agree with me. Joe had the most straightforward instructions.
97691,Psets were quite long and coding was not taught well/at all
97691,"This course is really quite nice and interesting. I like the organization of the course in terms of exercises and PSETS, and the fact that we have three sets of professors was quite fun.   I have only two weakness I think should be improved: 1. Professors Howard and Emonet had wonderfully clear and self contained notes. Although I liked Prof. Damon Clark's lectures, I felt that his notes should be improved for clarity and being more self contained. 2. The final project was essentially a sixth PSET. I wish we had more flexibility in choosing a topic for our final project."
97691,"Assigning more teaching assistants, or adding peer tutors, to this course would make it feel much more accessible!  MATLAB techniques weren't the focus of in-class instruction, but made up the bulk of assignments.  Offering more time for coding help would really make a difference.  TFs were great in person, but not always responsive to email. 2 office hours a week felt insufficient."
97691,"Strengths: current mode of teaching is really great, the flow is very appropriate, and the difficulty of the content is okay.  Weaknesses: deeper level of dynamical systems should be involved. Some definitions (e.g., on bifurcation, etc) is not clearly explained. Also, some more textbooks and further/supplementary reading should be provided-- there is no natural linkage between every module despite that within every module, the logic line is clear."
97691,Less homework!!!
97691,"A major strength of this course was the publication of detailed lecture notes (especially in the first two modules) that allowed students to revisit the relevant content in full mathematical detail. Another strength was the pacing of assignments, which was frequent enough to review the material but not so frequent as to be a major burden. One weakness in my view was the amount of ""blackboard mathematics"" that was involved in the lectures-- it feels like exposition of basic algebra/ODE work is best left to the lecture notes, as the derivations are both less time-consuming and easier to understand on paper. This lecture time could then be used to discuss both the intuition behind the solutions and significantly expand the course content itself-- it's impossible to judge, but I felt like symbol manipulations took up at least a third of the overall lecture time of the course. Another weakness in my opinion was the use of MatLab. I understand that it would be difficult to switch over the course content, but as a student who literally spent hours of frustration trying to make MatLab cooperate (with issues that sometimes confounded the TAs as well), I genuinely think it would be extremely worthwhile to make the change. The long-term trend in computational biology appears to be towards using python, and making the switch now rather than later will help the next several classes of students develop python proficiency and explore the course content in a more-intuitive and better-documented computational environment."
97691,Strength: Topics covered were diverse and involved a lot of different type of biological systems. Readings were helpful to get a broad sense of applications of topics learned in research.   Weakness: Lots of exercises and problem sets. Time requirement for class was high.
97691,felt that the lectures and assignments were disconnected.
97691,"Wonderful course! All three professors were friendly, kind and good at explaining. The course was also very engaging, and covered exciting topics that are inspiring to research that requires mechanics modeling. The only suggestion I have is to open a following higher-level course to cover more materials in e.g. diffusion, regulatory feedback, signaling cascades, branching process, etc. for students who wish to dig deeper in the beautiful world of system biology. One semester is not enough!"
97766,"strengths: engaging lectures, organized content, and great lecturer. Homeworks were hard but really improved my understanding of the content.  weaknesses: nothing outstanding, but the class is notified of a homework 1-2 weeks before they are due, so it's hard to plan ahead and know when to expect homework."
97766,"This course covers a lot of really interesting material, and the professor is very engaging. Two weaknesses: 1) there is an overwhelming amount of material at times, and lecture can move quite fast, and 2) the assignments are not very transparent, for example we did not know the schedule of assignments ahead of time and we never got to look at our grades exams because Prof Frank reuses questions from year to year. This lack of transparency made learning more difficult."
97766,"The course is well organized, but the lectures can be a bit boring. Also, having both a final exam and a final project felt like a lot."
97766,"The material is presented in a good way and it can be engaging at times, but sometimes the content isn't that interesting and becomes boring/dull. The concepts can also be difficult to grasp but the homeworks help."
97766,"Not what I expected. No clear or definitive conclusions were drawn, and I can tell exactly what I got from this course. The lectures were also very disorganized, starting some classes in the middle of lectures. The lack of organization and structure made it difficult to follow and prepare for each class."
97766,"strengths: great professor, really engaging weaknesses: slides aren't always clear"
97766,"This course could be improved by making lecture recordings accessible earlier, rather than publishing them a couple of days before the final. A strength of this class was the use of interactive examples to help keep students engaged and learning."
97766,Could be interesting for students very interested in Linguistics---if you are just taking this to see if you like CogSci/Language do NOT take this course.
97766,Strengths: very in depth  weaknesses: only for someone who is very knowledgeable and interested in linguistics. I took this as part of the cog sci breadth requirement and regret it - not for intro level students.
97766,Readings could be cut down
97766,"The course is well-organized, I think. The lectures follow a logical sequence though somehow I don't know what the main takeaway of the course was. That might be simply because of the nature of this young discipline, as claimed in class. One thing that could definitely be improved is the assessment of the assignments. The grades and comments are often released later than the next assignment is due, so there is no room for improvement."
97766,"The course is genuinely interesting and lectures were well done. I also found the PSETs engaging, although grading could be confusing/ lacked opportunities for partial credit. Overall ran smoothly, though."
97766,"The course covers many different topics and sometimes it feels like it moves a bit quickly. However, it provides an interesting and comprehensive intro to linguistics through a cognitive science perspective."
97766,Sometimes the information seemed to be over complicated and made it harder to learn the actual concepts because prof was using difficult vocab
97766,It's a really great course. It covers a wide range of topics that all work to unpack what language can tell us about the human mind. Weaknesses: I don't know if it was necessary to have both a final paper and a final exam. Perhaps a larger paper due sometime in the middle of the semester? Having the two biggest assignments/assessments of the whole course due within four days of each other was a little tough.
97766,"The lectures for this class are always in incredible. There is always something new to learn and blow your mind. However, sometimes they can feel clouded by the mass of details you need to learn and remember for the exams. Another strength is that there are a lot of TFs, so there are always office hours and discussion section to go to for questions and supplementary learning. And another weakness is that the homeworks sort of pop up out of nowhere, as there is no set schedule, so you never know when they will happen, so you can't plan."
97766,The course did well at going in depth in the content.
97766,"The strengths of the course are the engaging and well-structured lecture material. Professor Frank is a very enthusiastic lecturer, and I loved the ordering of the studies he presented; it felt like unfurling a problem through each lesson.  The weaknesses are that I felt as if section could be made more interactive."
97766,Some studies are kind of hard to follow and lectures sometimes felt like we were just jumping around but the professor is very enthusiastic about the topic which made this course a little better
97766,"Strength: professor always had good energy Weaknesses: Office hours were not that helpful, I oftentimes left feeling as confused as when I came. Lectures covered too much material and didn't designate enough time for each topic"
97766,The use of current research papers instead of a textbook was very effective and makes a lot of sense for the subject. This can definitely be applied to other classes Ive taken!
97766,I found the content of the course to be interesting
97766,"The material is very interesting, but often the 75-minute lectures had too much information. It would have been a lot more enjoyable if we had been assigned TFs and had two 50-minute lectures and a section (instead of having optional sessions that were a bit disorganized)."
97766,"the material is truly incredible and i feel like one really learns a lot in every class. i feel this is both the strength and the weakness of the course, in that i wish i had more time and assignments and quizzes to appreciate the material."
97766,Amazing overview of the field
97766,I think this course is taught well but there definitely are a lot of difficult and confusing concepts that I think would be helpful if they were reviewed an extra time or two to clarify the topic better. But I do think the weekly sections were helpful in doing that at times but I would have liked more review of the challenging concepts in class. I think the assignments were also challenging but a helpful check in to see what we were understanding and what was still confusing.
97766,"This course was very thorough and in depth with its content, but there were too many terms and concepts to memorize that it got overwhelming at times"
97766,I thought the content was interesting but the overall structure of the course was confusing.
97766,"I think there were good resources available to improve my learning in this class, but they seemed generally underutilized. For example, discussion sections were optional, but I often gained more from attending them than just going to lectures. Additionally, the study guides provided to us before exams were comprehensive and extremely useful but also lacked a lot of information, meaning the extra work you did was often an educated guess at what mattered most. Also, I would have appreciated a clearer syllabus and expectations, with set dates for lecture topics, homework, and exams."
97806,"I thought that the lectures were great and informative, but I wish there were more practice problems available to do."
97806,"Some strengths of the course involve the possibility to drop an exam. I believe that relived much of the class's emotions and anxieties around these tests. I think a weakness of the course is having assignments on Acheive and not inputing those assignments on Canvas. There were times where I forgot to check Acheive and I would be late on assignments. By inputing the links to the acheive on Canvas, I would've been more easily able to complete assignments on time."
97806,"Strengths: Lots of opportunities through assignments and quizzes to boost your grade and reinforce knowledge from lecture, discussion section format of practice problems in groups was very informative and helpful in reinforcing class concepts Weaknesses: Not enough reminders and notifications regarding homework assignments, have to pay for homework system out-of-pocket in order to complete classwork"
97806,"I think that Prof. Cooper is a big strength of this course. He is well organized and the schedule/structure of the class is laid out clearly. His lectures are clear and made sense to someone who had basically never taken chemistry before. We had no review sessions for the final, and I think that would be a big improvement."
97806,Time management was definitely a weakness of mine and I can improve that by making a better schedule for myself. I also just do not find the class super interesting or engaging which is no one's fault but mine.
97806,Professor Cooper tries to make the material as approachable as possible and offers plenty of opportunities for students to receive help.
97806,Strengths were the discussion sections and the quizzes that were in two parts. Weaknesses were no final review and no practice exams for the final.
97806,"Overall, because the instructor of this course ensured student understanding of the course material was efficient, I felt as though I knew the conceptual teachings of the course very well. However, when it came time for exams, I felt extremely underprepared when it came time for testing and wish more practice material was offered."
97806,"While the teacher was incredibly sweet, and the lectures did an okay job of teaching, the discussion sections felt weirdly designed, and didnt really help me learn. First of all, you needed to complete a quiz before every discussion section (on your own-which was graded even though the material was pretty much completely new), and then you would do the quiz together for another grade. Why couldnt we just start off doing the quiz together? Or we could have study groups which encourage group collaboration while we are doing the quizzes, especially since this is all new, it was quite stressful trying to figure it all out in a short amount of time without help. Additionally, the tests themselves did not give nearly enough time for completion. I handed in almost every test having to skip a question or two since I knew I wouldnt have enough time to think through it and there were other easier points to get (even though if given enough time, it would have been possible to figure it out). It felt like a test of your quickness in reading and writing instead of a test of my learning. The homeworks on achieve were surprisingly helpful, especially since it will walk you through how to do it through hints, but we did not get enough tries (3 tries to get it wrong when we are still new to the material is preposterous). It should have been 10 tries, or at least enough to learn through our mistakes without getting stressed about not getting the points."
97806,"I truly admire the way this course is designed, with this professor. I love the way Achieve weekly assignments are set up because they truly help a lot in learning the course material. I also feel that each aspect of the course is very fairly weighted. However, I think adaptive learning quizzes should remain available until the end of the semester (deadline should be end of semester) so that students can continue using them to practice."
97806,Strengths: The lectures are 50 mins long so it doesn't get boring and the syllabus is well structured. The professor is also really good at explaining stuff and tells you what to expect in midterms and exams. The midterms are great because its divided into topics so you dont have to study alot for one midterm and the online portion is open book. Weakness: The recordings are the worst quality and if you miss a lecture because you were sick or smth you cannot catch up untill the end of the weak when the recordings are posted
97806,Strengths: homework and adaptive quizzes and the practice questions for the exams  Weaknesses: tests were difficult and didnt have enough support with regards to questions and review sessions
97806,This course definitely seems to be designed more for students who have some sort of prior experience with chemistry and calculus.
97806,"A strength of the course is that the material covered is relatively simple you just have to put your time into it.  A weakness is that at times, the material on the lecture does not align with what is tested on the exam."
97806,The lectures are pretty boring.
97806,"Strengths: this course is very well structured and provides many resources for students to practice their skills and challenge their understanding prior to the exam. Professor Cooper is an excellent lecturer, and his lectures were supported by sections that allowed students to gain confidence with concepts. The combination of individual work, small-group activity, and lecture-wide teaching made this course more engaging, and the variety of assignments provided many opportunities for student growth.  Weaknesses: if there is any way to upload Achieve assignment reminders to canvas, that is the only big change I think would help students remember to complete their assignments on time."
97806,very good class. one weakness is that the final was unlike any of the midterms. i loved the weekly quizzes.
97806,Great course!
97806,The strengths are the way this class is set up by Professor Cooper! He was always willing to help and always understood certain circumstances!
97811,"The course can be better taught by the professor and the midterms should be in person. The lectures should cover all relevant matter that will be tested, instead of doing practice problems for 30 out of the 50 minutes of class while barely skimming through the important content points and leaving the rest in the textbook."
97811,The strengths of this course include the level of individual competency it teaches and the weaknesses of the course are cheating that happens during tests. It could be improved if there were more office hours.
97811,"this course was not taught in an effective way, the lectures were very difficult to engage with and often felt unstructured and unclear on what we needed to note down.  One good thing was the continuous assessment through p-sets and pre-lecture questions, which allowed us to keep up to date with our knowledge."
97811,"This course had reading questions that acted as checkpoints and motivation to keep up with the lecture content. The lecture slides for this course did not contain all of the information that you needed, and lecture felt unstructured at times. Therefore, it is crucial to attend section, office hours, and read the book to get a good grasp of the content."
97811,"The exam format is strange and somewhat unfair. A one-hour online exam with fewer than ten questions (some of which are all-or-nothing multiple choice questions) means that one small mistake can tank a student's grade. I would have preferred a regular (in-person, multi-hour, partial-credit-possible) exam structure like in CHEM 161."
97811,The structure is easy to follow and there are many resources available. But I found the professor's teaching strategy very hard to follow. It was not always clear what we were supposed to know and I could not understand a lot of what he was saying. I found it hard to pay attention in class because the content was not engaging.
97811,"Weaknesses: This course had many weaknesses, the most significant of which was the way exams were run. Exams were all held over canvas quizzes, and only 1 or 2 questions out of 10 would require that you show any work; the other 8-9 questions would either be multiple choice, or there would be a place to type in your final answer. This meant that it was not possible to receive partial credit for most problems, and that it was very easy to lose 10% of your exam grade on a single problem even if your only mistake was that you'd typed something into your calculator incorrectly. This also made it very easy for students to cheat, since they could easily share answers during the online exam without having to understand the work that went into getting that answer. Personally, I believe that when exams grade the process to reach a final answer as well as the answer itself, a more accurate assessment of a student's learning is obtained.   Strengths: This course follows the textbook almost exactly, so even when I didn't understand a concept that the professor had tried to convey, I could read the textbook's explanation."
97811,Lectures were not organized and slides did not cover talked about material.
97811,"The Psets were well designed to help learn the material, and I found that much of my learning came from doing the problem sets. On the contrary, I did not enjoy the exams. I do best when I have an exam environment, and since the exams were online I was left with my room, which was not a suitable environment for me. I wish that they could have opened a classroom with a TF as an option for students to take the exam in an exam room, as I would have benefitted from that. In addition, I found that the structure of the online exam, especially with the emphasis on fill in the blank answers where work is not considered was not conducive to assessing my understanding. Minor mistakes in work were considered to lead to absolute wrong, and partial credit was rarely awarded. The online tests were short and open text, so this did not impact my grade heavily, but I would rather my grade reflect my learning than be good. I urge that future years have a more traditional exam format, in person if possible."
97811,"Strengths: Achieve problem sets. The unlimited attempts feature on the problem sets greatly facilitates learning without the stress of a grade. Dr. Parr's slideshows are helpful and informative. Weaknesses: There was rampant cheating on the exams because they were Zoom-""proctored."" Many answers could be looked up on the internet, which drastically undermined student confidence in the integrity of the class and distorted the curve. The grading of Canvas midterms minimizes opportunities for partial credit. For example, a question requiring significant calculations might only be worth one point as a numerical value entry with no opportunity to show work. At the same time, getting a single multiple-choice question incorrect on a midterm would decrease one's score by up to 12%, sometimes bringing that score down to the class average just by missing one multiple-choice question. The biggest thing that would enhance learning in this course would be handwritten, in-person exams. Also, Dr. Parr's lectures often include extensive rambling that doesn't facilitate efficient learning of the material. While the slideshows are great, many lectures consisted of a projection of live handwriting (of example problems) on a notepad that was hard to follow. During lectures, it was very hard to tell what information was actually the content/skills we would need to succeed on the exams and what was simply background theory or distantly related material/fun facts."
97811,A strength of the class are that lectures can be in-person or virtual. A weakness is the lack of opportunities for partial credit on examinations.
97811,"Midterms were a bit short and they always will have at least one question that may stump you. The online format was different than what I'm used to, and the ""open-textbook"" (not open-note) policy helped me learn how to effectively use my textbook. I was very appreciative of the live streams of every class, but class was much more engaging and easier to understand when I attended despite the live stream option."
97811,"I believe the pre-class questions required by the professor was a strength of this course. Although having to remember to answer questions before going to class every day seemed burdensome, it proved very beneficial in understanding the concepts learned in class. I also appreciated discussion sections: my graduate student teaching assistant really helped clarify many of the topics. I also loved the open-note examinations this course offered; this prevented the need to memorize overly technical info and allowed me to better appreciate the general concepts surrounding many topics. I believe open-note examinations better parallel what professionals do in their daily life. The only info a professional likely memorizes is that which he/she uses frequently, but he/she likely uses references to refresh he/her memory on certain topics. Open-note exams mirror this use of references by professionals and are thus a bit more applicable to career-life."
97811,"The strengths of this course are the way material is covered in lecture and the helpful psets. The main way this course could be improved is by giving full-length in-person exams rather than unrepresentative, short online exams."
97811,"The strengths of this course include the fact that the professor went step by step through problems throughout the lecture and he was always relating the topics we were learning to real life situations. The weakness of this course is that it did feel a little rushed and sometimes the lectures would feel repetitive, but not comprehensive."
97811,Strengths the TA staff. Weaknesses Parr
97811,Seems it has to cover a lot of content but this becomes overwhelming because it is very fast paced if you've never learned chemistry before. Meant to be an introductory course but I would say is very challenging for those who have not taken AP Chemistry before
97811,I liked that the professor applied the content we were learning and showing examples of how to apply the knowledge. Sometimes I felt as though the content jumped from one thing to the next a little abruptly.
97811,The content is interesting and covers many different areas of chemistry. The problem sets are very helpful for the exams.
97811,The problem sets and exams all worked well but sometimes the lectures seemed disconnected from what we were being tested on/our psets. I also found the reading questions helpful.
97811,The strength of the class was that it was available both in person and online. The lectures were very hard to follow. Wished there were more clear directions placed for each chapter with more comprehensive slides.
97811,Online resources Sometimes lectures were long-winded; not the same as the textbook
97811,strengh: my TF sabrina! weakness: course structure and the exams grades were unfair (you could miss one multiple choice question and go from an A to a B)
97811,"The way the exams and grading in the class is structured is very stupid. Definitely one of the most unfair ways to have exams. The online exams were ""Zoom Proctored"" and they just expected people to not cheat, but the average on the first exam of Chem 165 was around a 92 and the average on the first exam of Chem 161 was a 68. People don't just get that much better at Chemistry over winter break. Additionally, because the class is on a ""class curve,"" where only a certain amount of A's, A-'s, B+'s, etc. are given out, it is unfair that the tests are online, which greatly increases the average score. It is unfair to those who actually work in the class, because they are stressed about their grades even though they likely know much more than people that are getting the same exam scores from looking up answers and such. Not a single person got a 100% on any of the 161 exams with Dr. Hazari, and yet there were 70+ total 100%'s on the 3 exams in this class, which is crazy to me. In person tests would be significantly better, especially for a Final Exam."
97811,"The one strength of this course was there were three midterms, which meant that there was very little material left to learn for the final given that it had all essentially already been assessed. This made studying for the final a little bit more feasible. There were many weaknesses of this course, one of them being that the midterms were online. The exams were ""open book"" but NOT ""open note."" This meant that you could have a textbook (online or paper) open during exams, but not your notes. However, it was acceptable to have annotations to your textbook available. The exams were proctored over Zoom which in my opinion is basically the same thing as no proctoring. It isn't realistic that a TA is going to be able to catch cheating over Zoom. It would've been very easy for students to collaborate during exams by either being in the same room and discussing, or messaging over text. Also, anyone could have used internet resources. It is unfair that people like me who were honest and followed the expectations of academic integrity are then put at a disadvantage given that this is a curved class. When people cheat, then do well, this affects the curve and therefore the success of other students.  Also, I did not appreciate the format of the exams themselves. There was barely any opportunity for partial credit. For the majority of the questions, you either received 6 (or even 12 points), or nothing at all. This was due to the online format because for most of the questions, you simply typed a number into a textbook, not showing any of your work. It was not an uncommon experience to use the right method/process to work out a problem, and then accidentally mistype a number into the calculator, obviously leading to an incorrect answer. There were maybe 2 questions per exam where you could actually upload your work to earn partial credit. Given that these exams were pretty short, getting the non-partial credit questions wrong significantly decreased one's score."
97811,"Lectures should go over more textbook material and actual notes, and maybe demonstrations did in class could be supplementary videos."
97811,"Strengths: distributing a lot of general chemistry content in a short amount of time. Weaknesses: really not any weaknesses come to mind. Though, it would be helpful if there were study sessions or enrichment sessions offered."
97811,"The fashion in which material was presented was often convoluted and hard to follow, which made learning the course material an often completely independent activity"
97811,I enjoyed the fact that this class was available online so I could rewatch lectures and that the outlines for each chapter corresponding to the textbook and our schedule were available. I did not enjoy the style of teaching and thought that many times we focused on irrelevant things (aka deriving equations and doing one an example of a reaction instead of giving us the general method of understanding all of the type)
97811,"Weaknesses: I personally encountered a lot of technical issues when it came to our online tests and even the final exam; I had to send some submissions via email after the portal was locked even though I answered them well within the time range. It also was not fair that most people did collaborative work and harshened the curve for the rest of us. Would much rather prefer an in-person test to evaluate our true understanding without external stresses with technology  Strengths :appreciated how all classes were recorded so it was very easy to hop back on track; we also had 3 post-class quizzes per week, which were very helpful as we remained interactive with the course. the Achieve questions had unlimited tries as well, which was very excellent in honing our perseverance as I ideally would have skipped those questions. Overall the class was very great up until the online assessments"
97811,"This class is all weaknesses. Professor Parr is not very considerate of students, replies to questions with backhanded answers, and runs the class as if he does not want to teach. The exams are terrible. They are online so they are subject to so much cheating and they are only a few questions (7-8) with very high point values."
97811,"Weakness - The online exams. There is no reason to still be forcing students to take online exams when COVID-19 is no longer declared a public health emergency. Moreover, the format of the exams encouraged cheating and academic dishonesty, which was evident in the grade distributions of midterms. Moreover, unlike in CHEM 161 (under Nilay's instruction), the TA's were not required to come to class, which caused a big discrepancy between what the TA's thought we needed to know for the midterms and what was actually tested. Also, there was not even a review session for the final exam, which caused a lot of stress since the final exam was cumulative and tested 10+ chapters of content. Plus, the reading questions due before class were unnecessary, as they soon became a way for people to quickly complete them rather than trying to learn from the reading questions. Additionally, the discussion section worksheets were not even available to the students as a blank copy, so they can practice on their own.  Strengths - TA (if you have a good one) and peers (form study groups)."
97811,"The course is well paced. As a weakness, it is not super well structured, and it is hard to follow if you are not attending every lecture. I found the exam distribution methods incredibly inconvenient and stressful. With that being said, the course is clearly designed for students to perform well.m"
97811,"The strength of this course was the fact that the pre-class questions and problem sets were ungraded. This gave students an opportunity to test their knowledge without being penalized. Also, the pre-class questions were a great way to stay on top of the content as it was being taught. The weaknesses of this course were Prof. Parr's teaching style and the virtual shortened exams. Prof. Parr's lectures tended to be dry and always ran 10-20 minutes late. Lectures should start and end promptly. Additionally, the online open-book format of the midterm and final exams was designed poorly as most of the questions were multiple-choice and thus, did not give an option for partial credit. Also, the value of each question varied greatly; for example, a lengthy calculation question was worth 1 point while another conceptual question was worth 6 points. This meant that getting very few questions wrong resulted in a terrible score. Exams should follow the format of CHEM161 and be in-person on-paper 1-2 hour exams with given formula sheets to give everyone an equal opportunity to succeed and allow for partial credit."
97811,"Strengths: accessibility of lecture material and structure of the homework (graded by completion)  Weaknesses: canvas structure of midterms and final exam, as the point distribution allowed for more room for error than for partial credit for work done."
97811,lectures could be better organized
97811,"Strengths: Classes were offered virtually in live-time. So if you didn't want to go to in person class, you could listen into the class in real time virtually. The midterms were accurate representations of what we were learning in class, I believe.   Weaknesses: Professor Parr's teaching style did not work well with my learning style. Most of the examples he gave in class were very disorganized and did not apply to the problem sets. He is also very sarcastic and does not seem like an approachable professor by any means. I felt very uncomfortable asking him for help with anything. The final exam was also a very inaccurate representation of what we had been learning throughout the year."
97811,This course could be improved by more comprehensive communication of what is expected of the students.
97811,Better attitude when students come to office hours. More dynamic teaching style rather than illegible handwriting. No online exams.
97811,"Overall I thought that this course was taught quite poorly. Unfortunately, I felt that the online Achieve psets and the textbook did a much better job at teaching/explaining concepts than the actual professor was. One weakness was that the lectures were not straitforward and did not explain new topics well at all. One improvement could be starting from the basics (definitions, explanations, etc) rather than jumping right into confusing practice problems. I also felt that the exams could be improved. Although it was in theory nice that exams were open book, many students felt the tests did not provide a good opportunity to show what we have learned because they were either extremely brief or tested concepts that were not emphasized much in class. Additionally, I feel that the weighting of exam questions was unfair as students were overly penalized for small mistakes even when they could have demonstrated a firm understanding if allowed to include the work/thought process that helped them reach that answer."
97811,"The very high disparity between lectures, psets, and exams. Also, the way the tests were very few, high-point questions with no partial credit made it very easy to lose points for minimal mistakes, which means your grade ultimately did not reflect your knowledge accurately at all"
97811,I appreciate that the lectures were recorded so that I could go back and review material as needed.
97811,"I think that the earlier units were taught very effectively, but I did not like the teaching of the later units as much. I felt the online exams, although I understand the rationale of relying on the textbook rather than one's notes, was silly. I don't think grades fully reflected one's level of studying (as with 7-8 questions a test, one mistake on a multiple choice question is a significant loss)."
97811,"The fact that all lectures were recorded but in person required masks encouraged students to not attend lectures in person therefore decreasing in class participation, but allowed for ability to take chem from anywhere at any time which was very helpful."
97811,"Strengths: unsure Weaknesses: Dr. Parr is an awful lecturer. I attended every lecture and learned almost 100% of the class on my own during problem sets. Also, the Daily Questions were unhelpful and an unnecessary extra thing to keep track of. They were testing how late I went to bed, not how much I knew from the class."
97811,Strengths: good structure of the course in terms of exam content and lecture content.   Weaknesses: some topics were taught too deeply in the lecture to the point of confusion.
97811,"Strengths: engaging, well thought out, amazing professor  Weakness: none that I could think of"
97811,"Strengths - none Weaknesses - I could have learned more by either self studying or attending only the discussion sections instead of lecture. The lectures were not helpful because Professor Parr explained things in the weirdest, most roundabout way."
97811,"This course is unfortunately one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale and made me sincerely reevaluate whether I want to keep pursuing science here. The lectures were incredibly disorganized and confusing - rather than first going over basic concepts and definitions, Professor Parr would instead spend class writing out a number of examples that he often failed to explain fully and connect to larger ideas. The lectures themselves were also clearly poorly planned out time-wise, and we often were either unable to cover everything in class or had to rush to fit in very important topics in the last five minutes. As a result, I learned almost nothing in lecture and had to teach myself the material using either the textbook or online resources in order to understand what we were expected to know. Because lectures were so unclear, the TFs had to spend section trying to actually teach us the basic ideas of the unit instead of building on the lectures and going over practice problems. (The TFs, who generously devoted so much time and effort to helping us succeed in this class, are the one strength I can think of in this course.)  My other major problem with this course was the assessment style. The midterms and the final were all on Canvas and were open book (but not open note). Many questions, despite the fact that they required lots of calculations and multi-step thought processes, did not have any space to show your work and only had you put your final numerical answer into Canvas. Because you couldn't show your work, there was no partial credit, which often resulted in ridiculous grade deductions. And because the exams were relatively short, each question was heavily weighted. (For example, if you did everything right on a question but simply plugged a number wrong into your calculator, you could easily lose 14%). It seems somewhat ridiculous to me that questions which clearly require both conceptual understanding and multiple steps of work don't have opportunities for partial credit, and thus making a small numerical error results in the same score (a zero) as literally not even answering the question. To me, this reflects a larger issue with the assessments - they are not designed in such a way that allow students to demonstrate their understanding of concepts, but instead hinge almost entirely on tiny calculation details. I also do not understand why the assessments were on Canvas - I think it would make much more sense (particularly now that Covid does not restrict this) to have in-person assessments (or at the very least, if they have to be online, to make it open everything) so that all students are on a level playing field."
97811,The lectures should be geared more toward homework and how to solve the problems we will be asked instead of random knowledge. But the discussion sections were very helpful in this aspect of the course.
97811,"This course had many weaknesses that could be improved in many ways. Firstly, the lecturers were not engaging and often many students could not follow Professor Parr's presentation of the material. He often went on tangents and pushed through material without ensuring students had understood the material. Secondly, the weekly problem sets should be counted for accuracy, as opposed to unlimited tries. The online format of the exams was inappropriate, given there was no reason they could not be administered in person. On the exams, students had limited opportunities to show their work / thought-process and in-person exams should have been administered."
97811,Horrible exam format. Didnt test knowledge. The lectures only covered a fraction of the content and had to learn most from YouTube and reading the book. Poorly structured and timed class
97811,Strengths- the lectures are recorded and can be viewed later. Weaknesses - the lecture might not go in depth on all the concepts that are needed for assessments.
97811,"strengths: there are many support resources such as discussion sections, peer tutors, and office hours held by the entire teaching team, exams are pretty fair in their assessment of our knowledge and they aren't too long, one exam grade is dropped  weaknesses: the lectures are not super easy to follow, slides don't have a lot of the information and examples that are critical, daily questions and problem sets can be hard to keep track of"
97811,The camera was sometimes not focused where it needed to be in the recordings. It was also difficult to ask questions during exams.
97811,"Strengths: broad-ranging curriculum with various chemistry topics, evident applications from General Chemistry I class, introduction to organic chemistry unit was helpful for exposure.  Areas for Improvement: at times, it felt as if the course was structured around the assumption that students possessed prior exposure to topics. This made it difficult to understand concepts during certain lectures. I found myself consulting the textbook to understand the majority of content."
97811,One strength was the recorded lectures.
97811,"This class is generally taught well until the end when it gets very confusing. Overall, I think the exams are not structured well, as there is so much emphasis on a single question (students lose points really quickly for smaller mistakes)."
97811,"Everything is good except for the online exam system, which makes it very hard to upload our answers in time, and it will not provide the exam environment that makes students focus."
97811,"Lectures sometimes felt a bit disjointed. Overall, reading the book as a supplement helped."
97811,No online exams. Redesign lectures so they arent rooted in the history of the topics we are supposed to learn. daily questions not helpful.
97811,The course covered a lot of material.
97811,The online exams have got to go. The professor was just completely oblivious to the vast amount of cheating that went on.
97811,very strong in exams
97811,"As a large lecture, with less than half of the class attending, it is discouraging to the scheduled class time. As for strengths, the subjects of the class are quite interesting, but there is not nearly enough time to cover everything in depth."
97811,The lectures were not very well organized and the online/open book exam format made them more stressful and so that I did not have to engage as deeply with the material. The topics were relatively interesting.
97811,I was able to learn a lot. There were no weaknesses.
97811,"Strength: the lecture videos were recorded and the homework had an infinite amount of tries without point deductions Weakness: Since all the assessments were online, for some of the answers if an answer is incorrect, it is just incorrect, and six points are deducted. There are usually only 9 questions on each midterm, so if one question is incorrect, a student only receives an 8/9. Be careful on the exams and study the math and basic concepts. During the organic chemistry unit, many TFs also did not understand the naming system, so students should learn that on their own. The lectures are always confusing unless you read the textbook ahead of time, so prepare to be confused after every lecture. Some students stopped attending lectures and just read the textbook."
97811,The class felt very disorganized and some of the material on assignments did not feel like they were covered in depth enough during class.
97811,N/a
97811,The lectures of the course were very well taught. I especially enjoyed how sample problems were walked through from each chapter. I also liked the problem sets being unlimited attempts in order to further encourage growth instead of giving up through searching up the answer.
97811,"A strength of the course was that it had a relatively lower workload than a lot of other introductory STEM courses. Additionally, all of the p-sets prioritized letting students try as many times as they needed on each problem until they got the correct answer and understood the process of answering the question. Another strength was how accessible lectures and lecture materials were, given that the lectures were recorded and live-streamed. A weakness of the course was that the class moved at a pretty fast pace and so it felt difficult to master the material when it was taught."
97811,"Strengths: Some interesting content and more direct applications to other fields than Gen Chem 1. One midterm drop was helpful, and some TFs office hours were helpful. Having the ability to come to class via Zoom was also an asset. Section questions and Achieve homework were great learning tools and helped prepare for assessments well. Weaknesses: Lectures were pretty confusing, with slides that didnt provide much information and really fast equations done on paper in ways that didnt help connect them to the underlying concepts. Tests were much more stressful than they had to be. While shorter grading is understandable, with 7-8 questions on a test and almost no chances to show work, if you made 2 math errors and misremembered one concept out of 4 chapters on a midterm, you could be looking at a sub-60% score when it often did not represent what you actually understood. Information on the curve was also hard to find grades arent everything, but particularly in a class with many premeds, tests with a standard deviation of 15 points and no clear curve policy make it really hard to tell how well you might do and prioritize time appropriately. Professor Parr often provided relatively condescending answers to earnest student questions, and approached office hours as if you didnt get it in lecture why should I have to explain it now? Overall, the course was frustrating and got in the way of just learning chemistry."
97811,"I would recommend making the exams in person to more accurately assess some questions through partial credit. During some exams, the lack of partial credit may have given me 0 points on a question that I should have gotten mostly correct due to the virtual formatting. Maybe even a picture submission can be implemented for each question."
97811,This course was pretty chill. There were plenty of resources provided that allowed anybody do well in the class. I thought the class was almost too chill to the point where I was provided so much flexibility that I couldn't stay disciplined in my learning.
97811,"I was not really a fan of the structure of the course. I found that the lectures didn't always translate to what was on the psets and then the exams, and I also found the structure of the exams being shorter and online more challenging and not always indicative of what I felt I had learned."
97811,"The professor felt distant and unwelcoming at times, and the lecture style was personally hard to follow. The online test format was both a strength and a weakness, because I felt the tests to be less intense than the paper exams, but it also meant one wrong digit loses you 5 points."
97811,Strengths:  Entertaining Engaging Informational Attentive to students growth Online practice and problem sets  More focused on life-applicable examples then material strictly for tests  Weaknesses: A bit dispersed with recorded lectures offered (allows for less students to be present in the lecture hall)
97811,"offer different medium to attend class, had the slides in advance, problem solved in class."
97811,"I think to fully grasp the knowledge of the course, you had to do a lot of outside reading and studying. I enjoyed the remote nature of the lectures and the live recordings."
97811,This course was poorly taught. The lectures were extremely hard to follow and the tests were conducted online which made cheating by other students possible. Many times concepts on the test were not covered in class.
97811,"I cannot think of any definitive strengths, but one of the weaknesses is that it is hard to be engaged in the class. The lectures are normal, but sometimes when deeper topics are discussed it is hard to determine what is meant to be retained and what is just being taught for the sake of it. Another weakness is that the tests have few questions which often dont have partial points, so making a small error can have a big impact on your grade."
97811,"Overall, I think this course provides a good overview of the many different fields of chemistry. Moreover, Dr. Parr was enthusiastic about helping us and willing to stay after class to have our questions answered, which I always appreciated. I also liked how he gave us a lot of resources and practice problems, and how he had a clear outline of what we would cover each day. His lecture slides were also very concise but effective, and the tests provided a good assessment of the topics we should know. However, he sometimes went too in-depth when explaining topics (more so than the textbook and the tests), which sometimes made the concepts more confusing rather than clearer."
97811,"I think that the online test format did not allow for enough partial credit on long written problems and made too many technical difficulties possible. To solve a problem on paper and then have to type out all of your written work to answer the online questions wasted too much time on the midterms. I preferred tests in the format of the previous semester of General Chemistry that were written, closed-book, and in-person. I did like how the lectures were recorded and therefore could be rewatched later when studying."
97811,"strengths: offered fully virtually, goes along with the textbook weaknesses: open book tests made it very easy for students to cheat and did not help us learn the material as well. I much prefer the paper exams that were closed note in chem 161 because it was necessary to fully understand the material before the exam and facilitated an increased amount of retention of the material. also, the exams did not fully assess our understanding of the material as not all of the concepts were covered, and they represented too small of a sample of what we had spent time in lecture learning. it was also very difficult to receive partial credit on these online exams because you could not show your work for most questions, so the grades did not accurately reflect how much you actually knew about chemistry. paper exams would better reflect one's understanding of the material because you'd be able to show all of your work and receive better feedback as was the case in chem 161. overall, the class was very disengaging, the lectures were not interesting and not well-organized, and the professor did a poor job of explaining concepts and encouraging students to participate."
97811,"Strengths: Course extends beyond topics covered in the AP curriculum to some pretty different and interesting topics (covers organic chemistry and coordination chemistry), TAs were available and helpful, feedback on assignments was clear, and the practice of having required daily questions (graded for completion) before every class definitely encouraged me to keep up with the material and helped me identify challenging topics.  Weaknesses: The course felt a little too dependent on technology overall, and I think my level of engagement with the course would have been higher if it were less asynchronous. All lectures were recorded and posted immediately, and midterms (three total, with the two highest carrying) were all open-book and online. By moving midterms to an in-person format and delaying the posting of recorded lectures, I think I would have been able to both engage with the course and learn the course material on a higher level."
97811,"The strengths of this course are that it pushes the student and allows them to grasp a better understanding of more advanced Chemistry topics, some weaknesses are that it does not cater to students who may have a weakness in understanding certain topics and fails to consider students with different learning styles."
97811,Strengths are that it is recorded which is helpful in reviewing content for the final. Weaknesses is that the professor sometimes rambles.
97811,"It's a pretty standard Gen Chem class so I'm not really sure what to say in regards to strengths. The TAs were all helpful and hosted numerous office hours, so that was definitely a plus. The weaknesses were pretty abundant, however: lectures were largely not worth attending because the teaching was so convoluted, the exams were open-book online but gave no room for partial credit, the pre-class questions were annoying, etc. I would say that lectures need to be a little more streamlined and taught more clearly. I think in-person exams are better, too."
97811,"The strength of this course is the willingness of Professor Parr to allow student to take the education at their own pace. By posting all of the lectures online, I could go back and replay any parts of the lecture I did not understand really allowing me to cement my knowledge."
97811,"i think the focus of the lectures were often scattered, where topics were covered without any clarity of what we actually needed to know. the homework assignments were helpful and pretty much the only way I knew what to study for the midterms. the grading overall was very fair, and the online midterms were nice"
97835,"The biggest strength of this course was probably in its organization. It was very easy to understand how what we had done in previous lectures related to the current lecture, and I found the ""lecture recaps"" at the beginning of each lecture to be extremely helpful. Probably the biggest weakness of this course for me was that there was maybe one in-lecture chemistry demonstration the entire semester - as someone who enjoys seeing theory applied in practice, this was a bit disappointing."
97835,"Course is organized pretty well, teaching fellows offer a lot of help, and peer tutors are extremely useful. The material is challenging but the course is formatted really well to aid learning. While there are four midterms (one is dropped), I feel that they are actually beneficial to learning and retaining the information learned in the course. No real complaints with the course."
97835,"The beginning of this course was overwhelming lecture material does not correlate well to homework. However, as I got more into the class and into material I had a better background in, I loved it."
97835,"I found the unique curriculum developed by Dr. Johnson to be the major strength of this course. The organization and scope of content covered were another major strength. Lastly, homework graded upon completion was a major strength that allowed for low-stress practice of the material. I found the 4 exam (and an additional final) structure to be a weakness. There was little time between exams to process course content, and this pacing seemed stressful."
97835,"Strengths: The lectures are well-paced and Prof Johnson starts each lecture with a recap of the last, which is very helpful for refreshing the contents. The TFs and peer tutors are very kind and helpful, especially when it comes to exam reviews.  Weaknesses: The class is quite challenging for someone who is no longer very familiar with topics in physics and sometimes its easy to feel lost in the class."
97835,"The problem sets and exams were well thought out and related to the course. I felt like there was always help for me from Professor Johnson, the TFs, and the peer tutors. The lectures were always interesting and I felt like I could see the myriad of applications of the lectures to concepts outside of the course. I cannot think of any weaknesses!"
97835,I think a strength of this course is how the exams for the most part are based on the problem sets and things we do in class and one weakness is that sometimes it is hard to know whether information in class is important to know or just extra information
97835,The strengths were the community and the peer tutors. The weaknesses were the teaching style and low access to office hours.
97835,The lectures were sometimes too derivation-heavy.
97835,"Strengths: Problem sets are very straightforward and manageable, units are clearly defined and relate to one another, exams are generally fair/clear, material is typical for an introductory chemistry course, due dates are very manageable and often adjusted to ensure that students are well-informed to complete them Weaknesses: Lectures move very quickly, but TFs do a good job at recapping tougher topics in discussion sections. Example problems/in-lecture activities to engage students in the material could make the course even better."
97835,"Great class, extra work for the same credit"
97835,"I really liked having practice tests available and the review sessions, that put together with the peer tutor's cumulative review was really helpful for exams."
97835,I really enjoyed Professor Johnson's qualitative approach to explaining complex topics. I would improve this course by offering more specific information about what will appear on exams.
97844,Strength: it covers a lot of material. Weakness: it covers a LOT of material.
97844,"Strengths: Incredibly well-taught. Interesting exams. Fantastic TAs. Great connections to chemical research, current and historical. Weaknesses: Honestly, none"
97844,"Strengths: Prof. Miller is incredibly passionate about teaching this class and is a very engaging lecture. He explains concepts well and shows you how they are applied in research and literature. The class is tough, but you get a lot out of it. Weaknesses: Grading is unclear, as Prof. Miller won't announce the curve until the end of the course. Exams were very difficult and sometimes were very loosely related to what was covered in class."
97844,"Strengths: Prof. Miller is an engaging and fun lecturer who makes attending a 9:00 AM lecture worth the trip up Science Hill. The psets were all graded essentially for completion, which was a nice low-stress way to practice that week's concepts. It's a pretty low-workload course outside of the midterms and final, which you will probably have to study extensively for in order to do well. We had practice exams before each midterm that were a good way to feel out how Prof. Miller was going to assess us. Prof. Miller uploads his lecture notes on Canvas the morning of each lecture, which is really handy to have open during the lecture (and for studying after). Whether you like organic chemistry or not, this course will undoubtedly help you to appreciate a lot of the cool stuff that modern organic chemists are doing, and how a lot of it is based on the fundamentals learned in undergraduate-level organic chemistry.  Weaknesses: It's really hard to know what Prof. Miller is going to test you on. There's so much content and only so much testing time. Unless you study literally everything, it's entirely possible that you'll miss something that's on the test. Prof. Miller also includes unique problems that you probably wouldn't find in most other orgo 2 courses, which are usually extremely difficult and force you to stretch your understanding of the fundamental concepts a little. This can be a plus if that's what you're looking for."
97844,It was taught very well so that understanding key concepts and patterns help facilitate student learning rather than straight memorization.
97844,"The course assumes a much steeper learning curve than CHEM 174. The disparity in the course formats makes the transition difficult to adapt to and CHEM 175 is a lot more stressful, unnecessarily so, than its fall counterpart, mostly because it assumes a greater mastery of the content and makes larger leaps and bounds in the spring syllabus than anticipated."
97844,"I liked the content of the course, as well as the way it was taught. Although it was fast paced, you get what you put into the class in terms of effort."
97844,It is a difficult class
97844,Strengths: organization   Weaknesses: book readings are very long and not all of it is always relevant
97844,"I think that there could have been more rigorous practice - I for one did enjoy challenges during the exam, however some problems were often just unprecedented in that we'd never seen anything like it before. Overall though, I enjoy the lectures."
97844,The exams were very hard and sometimes I felt like I didnt see them in my notes or the textbook.
97844,I loved the way the psets were structured and how available the TAs were to answering questions and meeting. I also loved the real life applications for each concept.
97844,"Miller is an amazing Professor and lecturer. And the TAs are amazing. While it is a difficult class, it will teach you to just keep swimming. Just keep working at it and you will begin to understand organocatalysis."
97844,"The course went into a lot of specifics during lecture, which made it very difficult to discern what the actual important material was. The main thing that saved this course were the discussion sections run by the TA's (who were amazing) and the review material given before exams, both of which clarified what we actually needed to know."
97844,The psets should be more reflective of the test material
97844,"Professor Miller is an incredible lecturer, genuinely interested in the content and earnest to share his enthusiasm with his students. He makes the content seem effortless, which makes the challenge of the course worthwhile. Strengths: teaching, Miller's office hours, the TAs are godly (for office hours, study halls, and discussion sections), the peer tutors are so helpful, the structure is very consistent and reliable. The content is stressful but the class is chill. Weaknesses: 9 am on science hill may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it becomes an iconic part of the package."
97844,The course exams were difficult and the class makeup is skewed towards high achieving students but Scott is a great lecturer and really prioritizes knowledge and learning.
97844,"Strengths: good pace, a great professor, challenging but fair exams. Weaknesses: slightly disorganized"
97844,"seemed to deviate a bit from normal orgo 2 topics but the content was rigorous and challenging. fantastic teaching assistants, and Miller is a decent prof although his exams are hard."
97844,"The lectures could have focused more on patterns and problem solving methods, which is how we were tested."
97844,"The course was well structured and accompanied by a textbook and regular problem sets to help students check their understanding. Problem sets included 4-5 required problems as well as an additional 20 optional problems that could be used as additional study help, so I felt that this course was very flexible for learners. The sheer amount of material we had to learn was challenging, and could be overwhelming at times."
97844,The exams were a bit too difficult in my opinion
97844,Good
97844,Professor Miller did a great job of structuring the course and I believe that the pacing of the course and topics were all well done.
97844,A more clear overview of topics before each is introduced would make the continuity of the course better.
97844,"This course is interesting, especially if you liked CHEM 174. Simply put, it's a lot of reaction mechanisms, which can be cool. However, you rarely learn the patterns that guide the mechanisms, making it needlessly hard."
97844,"Strengths - Prof Miller gives you suggested textbook problems which help in test preparation. For each exam, he gives a practice exam to gauge your knowledge.   Weaknesses - exams are very conceptually challenging and felt a bit unreasonable at times. There were a lot of ""I know we haven't specifically covered this yet, BUT why do you think this happens?"" questions. I felt as if no matter how much I prepared, I would not do as well as I would have liked to."
97844,The class was well organized and Prof. Miller is a very engaging instructor. It would be nice if there were recordings available to be able to easily make up for missed lectures. I also wished we could do more of the off-the-textbook stuff like learning from cool papers that are relevant to the reactions we are learning in class.
97844,"Strengths: Professor Miller is a good lecturer and really embraces your interest in the course material. He is very passionate about what he teaches. The TFs were wonderful and always willing to help out. We were able to drop one midterm. Weaknesses: We didn't really know our grade until the very end of the semester which became quite stressful at times. Also, the exams were truly some of the most difficult exams I have taken at Yale."
97844,The tests were very difficult but very informative
97844,"I thought the TAs did a wonderful job of helping the students. They were always willing to answer questions with emails and were very accessible to students.  This might be just for me, but I found the hard testing to be a little demoralizing and sometimes I felt like there was too much content that I couldnt cover."
97844,"For the most part, Organic Chemistry II allows for much more creativity in synthetic techniques; as the students' vocabulary of possible reactions develops further, so does their ability to string together complicated synthetic pathways. I had a lot more fun this semester taking on the PSETs and tests because of this.  I feel like delaying carbonyl chemistry until the end of the semester did it disservice, however. We ran out of time to fully explore the scope of these integral reactions, and with it some of the connections to key advances in the field were rushed (only briefly mentioned amino acids, didn't cover amine syntheses at all, etc.)"
97844,The course was thorough and well run overall! The content was challenging but presented in an engaging manner.
97844,"Strengths: taught really well, a lot of support given (through office hours, teaching assistants, etc), challenging but fair exams Weaknesses: lectures could be a bit disorganized/jump around a lot at times, went a bit fast at times, it's a difficult class, so know what you're getting into!"
97856,"There is a massive disconnect between Jason Crawford and Aaron Clark in this class. Jason is constantly trying to lecture about biological concepts, and Aaron writes the tests, so the tests are always pretty much strictly chem. This means that many of the exams do not overlap with the material we learned in lecture, and it makes for a strange experience because I never know what to prepare for the exams. I wish there were more communication between the two or the curriculum were more organized to be sure that what's being presented in lecture is what's on the exams."
97856,"strengths: i suppose it's an ok lecture course weaknesses: could be improved a lot. not very structured, sometimes the practice tests weren't as helpful as they could be in preparing"
97856,"The course is ambitiously designed to cover a lot of material in a short time and sets students up very well for biochemistry. However, the course desperately needs problem sets. The main weakness was a continuous push and pull between the professor and the preceptor. The professor taught mechanisms and reactions (and a lot of biochem/chemical bio) while we were examined mainly on orgo applications of what we had learned. This made it so there was little practice for exams, and the practice exams did not cover all the content we did and had extra topics we didn't cover (and they were given online so a different level of difficulty was realized). All of this is to say that the course needed practice problems, and we didn't have them. Also, a 50% final exam does not seem to be the best way to assess student learning in the course. Dropping a midterm was great, but a single final exam worth 50% doesn't seem reasonable or fair."
97856,Strengths: content is good and interesting. TAs and peer tutors  Weakness: no way of checking yourself or your work (you learn from the mistakes and points you get off from tests). Grade is 100% exams. Just lecture class and exams (not enough structure). Lots of self studying. Stuff that comes up on tests tests you on stuff not discussed or warned of in class
97856,"I think the main weakness of the course is the lack of problem sets. There are optional practice problems on Achieve, but a lot of them don't have to do with what we actually talk about in lecture. The course is very loosely structured and exams make up our entire grade--but without problem sets, there is no structured way to consistently practice for the exams.   Also, moving from off-sequence to on-sequence chemistry classes revealed that there are discrepancies between the curricula, and this class was taught seemingly without awareness of that fact. It would be best to either offer CHEM 221 in the fall or standardize curricula across off- and on-sequence CHEM 220--or at least make sure the 221 professor is aware of what discrepancies might exist."
97856,"I think the intentions of the course were well, and the professors made themselves available to students by way of office hours. However, pedagogically, I think there are a few areas of improvement. Firstly, it would be helpful to provide students with psets (instead of the Achieve practice problems) to work on throughout the semester. This would serve a twofold purpose: first, it would help students build a better understanding of what kind of questions may be asked in exams so that they can start thinking in the right frame of mind, and second, it would give students a chance to show their knowledge of orgo in settings outside exams, giving them an opportunity to boost their grades as well. It would also be helpful if the lecture notes were a little bit more organized and if they were regularly posted on Canvas after each class to ensure that students have the resources to learn the material adequately."
97856,"Strengths: Prof. Crawford is a wonderful lecturer, Dr. Clark is a great preceptor, and there were a lot of resources to help ensure that i understood the material. I am grateful that classes were recorded to facilitate re-watching the lectures to better understand the material afterwards. Weaknesses: having an exam immediately after spring break was more difficult than I had anticipated it would be. Would have appreciated optional problem sets to verify that I understood the material before the exams"
97856,"The course overall is great but requires a lot of memorization, even though the profs will insist it doesnt. Knowing the chemical trends can certainly help, but its an empirical not predictive science, and most mechanisms must be half logicd out and half memorized. The trust the profs put in us to review material on our own (and therefor the lack of HW) was great and let me manage my own schedule and learning nicely. On the other hand though, the fact that the exams were worth so much (final was 50% of grade) was not ideal and super stress-inducing. Overall, though, this course was well run and good at teaching us the material."
97856,"The biggest weakness is the grading breakdown. 50% midterms 50% final is not helpful for learning and retaining content. Instead, you do nothing most weeks of the semester and then cram the week before a test."
97856,"The TFs, peer tutors, and instructors were fantastic. This class has a relatively low workload (since homework is not weighted in the final grade), but your grade is dependent on solely exam scores. The lectures were generally good, but sometimes a little unorganized as Professor Crawford would often jump into explaining something or showing a reaction mechanism without telling us what mechanism this is, what biomolecule we are looking at, etc. This made studying for exams or reviewing content more difficult as you would have to piece together what everything was and how it related to each other. This was particularly true during the last third of the class, but was the only downside."
97856,Strength: Dr. Aaron and the TAs. They did a fantastic job delivering the content in an affective way.
97856,The teaching is pretty disorganized and it can be hard to follow along with the examples Dr. Crawford give because he doesnt really give much background on what he is teaching before jumping into examples. I do like how the last section of the class started introducing me to biochem.
97856,The lectures were dull at times
97856,"Strengths - lots of interesting content, exams were written well Weaknesses - the grading system was 50% midterm, 50% final exam and that's a really scary split up. I think having some sort of extra credit option or homework category would be beneficial."
97856,"The course was very challenging, and I wish there was a mandated homework and section grade to give a buffer for students who don't perform very well on exams. However, there was a lot of support through office hours and study halls. The teaching staff was very responsive."
97856,"Strengths of this course were Professor Crawford's passion for the subject. Weaknesses were that the course was very stressful because 100% of your grade is exam-based, and you truly have no idea of what your score could be if you are performing in the middle range."
97856,The strengths were the recorded lectures. It could be improved if the grade was not solely determined by exam scores.
97856,"The greatest weakness is that there is little support in between midterms to help students learn and retain information. Sure we have the achieve but it rarely aligns with the information that is tested and thus made it virtually useless (do not buy Achieve for this semester). I highly encourage this course to take into consideration problem sets, even as long as it's optional, so that people can keep up with the lecture material. The greatest strength of this course were the practice exams that were released a few days before each midterm. They accurately reflect what will be tested while being challenging. Even so, the keys the the practice exams were horribly written (basically unreadable) and sometimes there were no keys to the practice material so that was very annoying."
97856,Strengths: Aaron Clark!  Weaknesses: Jason Crawford.
97856,"The strengths of this course were the pacing of the class and the material that was tested. This course however had units that were too filled with too much material and then units with less material. I think the different units could be reorganized in a way that balances the three exams out. Additionally, I like how the topics for each exam were laid out because it narrowed my studying and preparation for the exam."
97856,"I think the strengths include learning about mechanisms. However, the exams were long and much more difficult than I think the class material."
97856,"It was be very fast-paced, but the review sessions were very helpful."
97856,It was intimidating that the course was 100% based on exam grades.
97856,Strengths - interesting in how the chemistry was related to biological concepts. Crawford is a good lecturer and knows what he is talking about. The recorded lectureres were extremely helpful as I could go back and research to find things I missed the first time. Weaknesses - it was hard to capture and understand all of the concepts of each class the first time during lecture. I found myself writing things down that didn't make sense until researching the lectures.
97856,"The professor is probably great for biochem, absolutely garbo for orgo"
97856,I wish wed had psets or more practice problems in general so we had more opportunities to practice the material before it was time for the exams.
97856,This class was very poorly organized it was hard to find the connections between the course lectures and the exam content until review sessions that would be held just days before the exam. The course content was often not applicable to the topics at hand. More information on the syllabus about the materials and the content is essential. This lack of structure makes it so hard to know what we are talking about in class. There is barely a textbook for the course.
97856,I think some weaknesses of this course was that it was entirely exam based - it often didn't feel like a holistic measure of how much material I understood. I found myself really struggling during the midterms at times despite having spent extreme amounts of time prepping for the midterm.
97856,"Strengths: instructor lectured well, teaching team was very organized and responsive   Weaknesses: it was at 9 AM"
97856,"Professor Crawford is an amazing professor, and he made it very easy to understand difficult concepts in the class. Additionally, the Teaching Staff and Dr. Clark were very adept at explaining things and breaking down the reactions and mechanisms into understandable formats. There also aren't any assignments, which makes the workload light but can make it hard to grasp concepts through examples. I think one major weakness is that when it came to biological molecules and applications, the course lost a lot of the focus it had in the beginning and started to become less comprehensible."
97856,Strengths: Aaron Clark is absolutely amazing. The lectures all connected to each other.
97856,Strengths: - lectures twice a week  Weakness: - lack of linking between lectures made them a challenge to follow  Improvements: - live demonstrations - nonscience analogies to make the concepts feel more personal
97856,The class was taught in a pretty confusing way the content is interesting but definitely challenging.
97856,The course required a lot of self-direction with the only grades being 2 midterms and 1 final. This was a strength and weakness because it saved time for people who could grasp material quickly but for someone who needed more help sometimes it was difficult to identify gaps in knowledge without homework / more structure. Weakness was that the final was 50%
97856,"Weaknesses: Not having homework/assignments that keeps you engaged between the midterms and kinda lower the weight on the final (because 50% was insanely a lot).   Having two instructors, both of whom are lovely and exceptional, who had somewhat different ways of approaching the course -- Dr. Crawford was more focused on biological chemistry while Dr. Clark was more into the actual organic chemistry."
97856,"This course was difficult, but it always felt like there was support outside the lectures if you just asked for it. While it was nice to not have psets, without proper homework (achieve did not do a good job reflecting the course material), it was hard to practice putting what he learned in lecture into action. Strong practice questions -and not just previous exams from other professors who valued different topics- would have been so helpful!"
97856,"This course felt like there was too much material to internalize all of it enjoyably. Likewise, the way that professor Crawford taught the course felt confusing, as he rarely connected lessons to overarching concepts or explained how different mechanisms/ideas were related to each other."
97856,"This course was quite stressful as the lectures did not feel helpful. We spent classes watching mechanisms be drawn and explained with a biology focus when the tests were more ochem focused. Overall, the details of lectures did not seem to match what we were eventually tested on."
97856,"Strengths: lecture format of class made it much easier to learn (in comparison to flipped classroom in CHEM 221) and having no homework and only practice problems was extremely helpful and made it a much better learning experience. Instead of trying to get the work done by the deadline, I was able to take as much time as needed to actually understand the content. Weakness: we were just thrown a bunch of reactions in lecture, and it was difficult to follow along and recognize what we needed to learn. Especially when biomolecules were used, the names were dropped with no explanation, which was hard to conceptualize. Some more organization when presenting the material would have been nice."
97856,I think this course was very disorganized and was one of the worst structured classes I have taken. There was no homework or PSETS and our only grades were three midterms and a final worth 50% of our grade. we had no practice of material as there were no psets and there was only optional achieve hw which even the TAs told us not to do because it did not relate to the course content. The class was taught by our professor which was hard to follow but the exams (our only grades) were written by the TA and often the professor did not even know what was on the exams.
97856,"This class took years off of my life, to be honest. When you go to section and even the TA is confused about whats being taught, thats when you know things are bad. Dr. Crawford is a nice guy, but his lectures are incredibly unstructured. I had to teach basically the entire syllabus to myself from online resources and Organic Chemistry as a Second Language. There are no problems sets and no quizzes, so your entire grade rides on three midterms (with one drop) and a final, but the tests are all over the placeon our exam 3 test, we were tested on exam 1 material (which was taught months before) without warning, literally just to trick us. To top it off, there was no curve in this class even though the average on 2/3 midterms was in the low 70s. Given that this subject is generally regarded as one of, if not the hardest, pre-med requirement, this seemed like an unnecessary and honestly cruel way of educating. If you can help it, protect your sanity and take this course somewhere where they actually want the students to do well and learn."
97856,"The biggest flaw of this course is that there's no assignments or ways to assess our learning prior to exams. This meant a lot of us went into exams feeling prepared and then realized we had gaps in our learning. The practice exams were from previous years when the course was on zoom and therefore open-note, so they weren't helpful in assessing how prepared we were for the actual tests."
97981,Strengths: TAs are wonderful! super super amazing with homework.  Weaknesses: lectures could be sometimes ineffective.
97981,"Course felt pretty disorganized, lectures were dry and didn't connect with psets."
97981,"Professor Park truly wants to teach students coding and has a brilliant passion for it. I feel like the class was very fast paced and it was difficult to keep up with after the 4th week. I think the amount of office hours that were available created a really strong support system for students; however, I was often confused in lecture."
97981,"The weaknesses are that sometimes lectures went very fast, there is a lot of information, and very hard to organize together. The strength is that there is a lot of discussion section and office hours that are helpful."
97981,"This course is designed so that you don't fall behind, but a lot of people still slipped through the cracks. I struggled to keep up with the pace of the class even after attending office hours, but this was more of a me thing than a class thing."
97981,Strengths: a strong group of TAs really helped students to navigate through data science and coding Weakness: the lecture of modeling part might be better delivered if there is a comparison table of strengths and weakness of modeling shown in the beginning.
97981,"Strength: go through a lot of material in a short span of time, the final project is very helpful and ties everything together, extra credit opportunities are encouraging, TAs are very great at what they do and very accessible  Weakness: with the final project it would have been helpful to have more feedback throughout (it was difficult to know if our models were appropriate and if not, how to fix it before it was too late)"
97981,"This class should NOT be titled as specified for Humanities and Social Sciences. Nothing about the pacing or course material categorizes it as such and it is false advertising. Just call it intro to python and move on. There are so many weaknesses, mainly the pacing of the class. If you do not have coding experience there is a major learning curve and you are not given the grace or time to catch up since everything builds upon the next thing you learn. The TAs were great but if you don't understand what's going on how great is the class actually? It is entirely too much content. There is a PSET each week that takes SIGNIFICANT time especially if you are struggling. No matter how much you go to office hours, DS, or pay attention in class it will take a very long time if you are not experienced with coding. On average about 9-12 hours a PSET."
97981,"Strengths: Professor Park is very nice and will take time out of her afternoon to explain concepts to you one-on-one. Also the ULAs were super awesome and helpful. Weaknesses: I felt like Professor Park waaaaay overestimated my capabilities to understand CS. The lecture format of this course meant that every single class we'd blur through all these complicated CS concepts and it was just impossible to follow. The unit in which we were supposed to learn all the CS basics necessary to perform our statistical analyses felt far too short, and Professor Park squeezed in the whole complicated system of object oriented programming four days before the midterm, and then made have the midterm about object oriented programming. I feel like this class maybe would have worked a lot better if it had been in a seminar format, with more emphasis on professor-student interaction and in-class time to practice and really understand the models we were working with. Maybe a reverse-classroom situation would've helped too. In the current format of the class, I felt like I never really fully understood what I was doing, which was super frustrating, and even when I was able to get my code to work for the final project, I'd get results I couldn't analyze or evaluate because we didn't spend any time discussing what a good accuracy score looks like, or what a strong R-squared measure is."
97981,"Strengths: Prof. Park is super accessible and understanding of deadlines and students needs. There was so much extra help in this class and if you used it (went to office hours and discussion section), it made the course a breeze. The problem sets always helped me learn concepts from that week and never felt overwhelming. I also appreciated the extra practice for the in-person exam. Weaknesses: The data science part of the class (the second half) moved incredibly quickly. We didn't need to know all of the material presented, neither for our final project or the second midterm exam, so I think this course could use some restructuring of that section. I feel like I've walked away knowing many data science concepts exist, but I can't quite explain all of them."
97981,Good introduction to Python. I wish we spent more time solidifying the basics and learning concepts like objects and classes more in depth before moving in to data science concepts. I think learning fewer data science concepts at a slightly slower pace would have also been helpful. A lot of statistics and data science were thrown at us class after class the last half of the course and it was hard to retain or feel comfortable with much of it.
97981,Strengths: The ULAs and TAs were extremely helpful and the grade breakdown (how much PSETS were worth and projects) of the class were fair
97981,pacing was much too fast
97981,"Poor lecturing and lecture format, not helpful or engaging. The rest of the course was formatted well, though. ULAs were great."
97981,strengths: Professor Park is amazing. she really cares about her students and our learning and is constantly trying to improve the class weaknesses: you cannot do well in this class unless you go to office hours and discussion sections A LOT
97981,"I really appreciated how professor Park tried to accommodate our learning pace by going slower at times. Also, she did a great job of making the material approachable and not scary and she made sure to make sure we were engaged by checking in throughout each class."
97981,Strengths: this class fills a huge void by being approachable to non-majors but still teaching key CS concepts. The plethora of ULAs and office hours was also tremendously helpful. Weaknesses: Sometimes class went so quickly through modules that it was impossible to copy down all of the code or follow what was going on. I also felt that the content of the second half of the course tried to cover too many things so I didn't get depth in any of them.
97981,You will learn python! but the thing is Professor Park goes too fast and covers too much! I would have to spend 3 hours at office hours after class!
97981,"strengths of this course would be that it is well organized and covers a lot of material, also the TA's are very helpful and try their very best to help you understand concepts that you don't which for me was the entire class  weaknesses would be that the class moves way too fast and doesn't really give people time to actually understand things before implementing them. The final project starts way before I was technically capable of completing something like that and it just completely threw me off tbh."
97981,Taught very well and easy to follow and very practical skillset gained
97981,"Expectations on certain assignments or projects could have been somewhat clearer. However, overall, the course was very supportive in all areas and used a variety of types of assignments/projects to learn the material from various angles."
97981,"Strengths: TFs were great, the subject was interesting.  Weaknesses: speed of the course. It would be so much more beneficial to break this into two courses. Even Cs Majors who looked at our syllabus were shocked at the speed we were going at. Lectures were too fast, and we went through the modules so fast we ended up having to go relearn the material in discussion sections. The didnt spend much time on the extremely hard concepts, so when the exam came around, I felt unprepared despite studying for hours and going to OH every week on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and sometimes Friday. Also, the way class info was shared was so inconsistent. Different TFs would be telling us different things, and some regularly would say they too, dont know Whats going on."
97981,"Professor Park is amazing but sometimes she goes too fast and its easy to feel lost in class. However, I was able to catch up during ds / office hours l"
97981,"Strengths: the subject matter of this course is interesting, especially if you want to think about CS application to humanities / social science topics. You'll leave the class feeling like you have a pretty strong grasp of Python basics, and the ULAs are phenomenal. Professor Park is also very sweet. Weakness: the class goes VERY fast (which I don't think the professor was aware of) and almost everyone I knew was often lost, overwhelmed, and confused. The lectures and lecture slides are difficult to follow, sometimes the Pset questions didn't make sense (even to the ULAs), and you'll need to rely on teaching yourself and talking to the ULAs in order to grasp a semblance of what's going on."
97981,"Professor Park is very kind and considerate, if not always the clearest lecturer. I realized pretty soon that I'd have to learn a lot of the content alone, because there was so much covered in class that it was impossible to follow without having basically done everything beforehand and, at that point, there's not much sense in going to lectures. Many others in the class realized this as well.  In my opinion, the biggest weakness of the class is the content. I wasn't entirely sure why the discipline of data science existed before taking this class, and having taken it I'm less sure than ever. Learning about and solving problems using Python was fun enough, and I quite enjoyed the first half of the course, but as soon as we started getting into data science I was entirely lost intellectually, emotionally, and morally.  The best part of this class is the grading structure. When it's all said and done, 85% of your grade will come from take-home assignments, which is huge. The fact that everything is spread out over a bunch of different small assignments also takes some pressure off. All the assignments are easy enough to do well in if you're willing to put in the time."
97981,"The 11AM problem set deadline made time management a bit difficult, in that sometimes the need to finish a pset last minute meant skipping a 9AM class or losing sleep rather than a midnight cutoff"
97981,Strength: The amazing TFs and ULAs that provided numerous office hours.  Weakness: Some of the content felt rushed.
97981,Office hours are helpful. The final project proved a bit constraining.
97981,"This course does expose you to many basic Python programming skills, albeit very quickly, and it does briefly expose you to what you can do with Python, especially with data science. However, I think the course was too ambitious in its goals to try to expose students to as much material as we were exposed to this semester. There was too little time to absorb the large amount of information we were given, and it was often difficult to grasp the applied part of the class because everything was gone over so quickly."
97981,Less confusing slidesthey are sometimes lifted directly from external websites that are more clear themselves.
97983,"Strength: interesting psets every week, only one midterm, a final project to put things together"
97983,"Strengths: good pacing, order of material made sense, I felt that the psets were a good difficult  Weaknesses: sometimes we did not cover everything that was necessary for a pset when it was released. There was also no discussion between section leaders / Professor Barron about where we were in lecture so we would sometimes do things in section that made absolutely no sense because we hadn't covered that material yet. For both lecture / section, there were a few times where there was simply way too much information for the given amount of time."
97983,"Strengths: psets are good and challenging. rarely felt totally overwhelmed. lots of opportunities to pick up points and not centered on the tests Weaknesses: lecture can be long and drag on a bit. required section, which was helpful but the course is a really big time commitment"
97983,"I think the course starts off very strong, but then gets very advanced for someone with no coding experience whatsoever. Also, it is very difficult to stay engaged in lectures because the complexity of the code that is being analyzed is often a lot. Also, there is not enough emphasis put on how to think about the algorithms that you are trying to create."
97983,"I loved the psets because they were always something fun, but the class itself is very difficult. I had a hard time applying what was taught in class to our weekly pset assignments, but if you want to do well, you DEFINITELY have to go to office hours."
97983,"Because this course is in a fast paced but long lecture format, I think having access to the slides at the start of class would be very helpful so students can annotate the slides and or follow along from a smaller screen. However, it is very nice that the lectures are recorded, and the discussion sections are well organized (and appropriately on Thursdays at the start of the pset period) to facilitate the learning of new content."
97983,"I sort of wish the lectures had been a little more interactive. I suppose you could code along as Tim went through applications in VS Code during lecture, but that wouldn't be the most practical when you're still just trying to grasp the concepts. I loved doing the psets, but the lectures themselves weren't always the most engaging."
97983,"Strengths - The psets are generally interesting and engaging, and the TA's are very helpful when it comes to tackling any issues with your code.  Weaknesses - lectures are not very engaging, and slides were usually only posted a day later; it would have been very helpful to have the slides / skeleton code examples earlier to be able to follow along during lectures."
97983,"Strengths: fair psets, fair midterm, overall not a difficult class at all. Weaknesses: sometimes lectures were a bit dry/un-engaging. The course would befit from 3 times a week 50 minute lectures instead of two longer ones."
97983,I think a lot of the psets we do are too complex for our level of beginner and some feel too separated from what we are actually learning
97983,No strengths of this course. Genuinely the worst class I have ever taken in my life. I was super excited about learning CS and now I hate it and will never take it again. Much better to take CS50
97983,"It takes a lot of time to learn how to code so expect to spend a good amount of time outside of class to work on weekly assignments. The course does, however, provide a TON of office hours and one-on-one assistance with those assignments, so take advantage of them. It is a great course but you have to put in the work to get past the finish line."
97983,"Strengths: Interesting psets, wonderful and approachable staff, lots of freedom with the final project, engaging lectures, very approachable and accessible to all backgrounds!"
97983,"Strengths: Some of the TA's were really helpful  Weaknesses: So much. The lecture material was not taught very effectively and most of my learning was from the TA's at office hours or by trial and error while I completed the PSET's. I would not take another class with Professor Barron honestly. I wish I had just taught myself CS over the summer on Youtube and then taken CS 201 in the fall, or I wish I had just taken CS 50. The lectures were not engaging and were very difficult to sit through. Some of the PSET's were way too hard and even the TA's said they did not really understand how we were supposed to do them. I never felt adequately prepared to do the PSET based on what we had covered in class/section. Many of my friends who were in the class with me dropped. Sometimes I lost points on the PSET for things that had not been explicitly told to us in the instructions. The PSET instructions were also really unclear sometimes. Professor Barron was also very difficult to communicate with over email or after class. There were also frequently clear mistakes in grading that I had to point out in order to make sure I was given the credit I had earned."
97983,"I loved how interesting the psets were, I also think the course doesn't prepare you at all for the midterm. The final project was fun."
97983,"I think generally, the progression of the course was well-organized in that each pset built on previous ones in productive and interesting ways that rewarded staying engaged.   The last month of the class was definitely the worst - we rushed through swing and then were expected to use it for the final project, and I think most people felt pretty unequipped to do so, especially with inconsistent office hours (I would have liked the course instructor/manager to be more present at the last few office hours)."
97983,"Too much work, bad section materials"
97983,The course requires a moderate amount of work from students. Lectures could be more engaging.
97983,"Lecture could be a bit more engaging, and we definitely should've covered GUI interactions more thoroughly because I had to teach it to myself to do the final project."
97983,"Strength: The problem sets became increasingly interesting as they grew in complexity, and I ended up building software that I was proud of and that I can see the use of. I also was able to appreciate the coding behind the technology I use every day. Weakness: I think that the midterm test being on paper was strange given that all of the coding we do was on the computer. I don't know if there are lockdown browsers or other ways to take a test on the computer while still maintaining academic integrity, but I think that changing that test to digital would more fully simulate the actual coding we do in the class and beyond."
97983,More live demos in lecture
97983,"Lots of work, but worth it. You really get a good foundation of the basics, and some intermediate concepts."
97983,ULAs were useful and problem sets were challenging. There were many hours of office hours throughout the week.
97988,can be helpful in building foundation for my python
97988,"Strengths: class code,"
97988,"Well-organized and well-taught. I thought that the statistics unit in the class felt somewhat disjointed from everything else, and it might have been good to start with that unit rather than cramming it in at the end, but it was not that big of a problem either way."
97988,"Strengths: recorded lectures, enough TF / Peer Tutor hours, accessible format (Jupyter notebook)  Weaknesses: inconsistent pacing of class, occasional very difficult homeworks, no accurate reflections of midterm / final exams."
97988,"I really like the class exercises we did in class. I also appreciated how readily available the lecture recordings were. However, the biggest weakness was the pace of the course. It felt like we spent a lot of time on the basics, so much so that we didn't really get to explore in depth some of the more challenging parts of the course. In fact, it sometimes felt like an intro to Python course with a bit of data science, rather than a data science course with a bit of Python."
97988,"I really appreciated the lecture recordings, as there were quite a few lectures that I could not make it to."
97988,There is no section for this class which means we did coding during lecture. Because of that sometimes it felt like the pace of the class was too slow and didn't learn a lot overall.
97988,The class was very code heavy and could use a little more actual data science concepts.
97988,"Hand written exams when the entire year was devoted to online program was slightly bothersome. Otherwise, it was a great course."
97988,Great course! I did not see any weaknesses.
97988,"cool class for sure, but the structure of it wasn't great. This semester we learned code different from previous years, and there weren't a lot of resources to help us improve/practice the code applicable to our class"
97988,"The strengths of this course are surprisingly the homeworks. I learned so much from each assignment, and got to put what we were learning in practice. The EdStem is also vibrant and helpful. However, the midterm exam was difficult for a lot of students, which was discouraging in our learning."
97988,"This course does a pretty good job of teaching coding even for beginners like me. Classes and homework are both very hands-on, which is really helpful. It's easy to learn by doing, and the assignments often go step-by-step to help you out.   The main weakness of the course to me was exams. The course is ostensibly designed for people who want to learn how to code but aren't necessarily pursuing computer science jobs after graduation or anything. For those of us in this position, it doesn't really make any sense to have to take difficult, fast-paced exams where we are writing out code on paper. It just added a lot of stress without helping me actually learn anything. Assignments like the final project were much more helpful, allowing you to put the skills to use on something you are actually interested in. Also, I found that the statistics section of the course was relatively weak. It kind of erased what I thought I knew from intro stats, and I ended up more confused than ever because we didn't really spend much time covering it. I think it would be better to just remove this section and learn more python data analysis instead."
97988,This course is perfect to me. I enjoyed it!
97988,The course does a great job of facilitating student learning prioritizing time during class to practice using the code in live time. Assignments help foster a stronger understanding and do not necessary feel entirely like busy work.
97988,Lectures are boring and feel kind of disorganized
97988,The course is perfectly designed.
97988,The instructor was super clear in each step and explaining concepts to the class. I learned a lot!
97988,Could be a bit more organized and be provided with practice exams that are more comparable to our exams
97988,strengths: great way to learn data science. Weaknesses: none
97988,I like the transition to using real data sets and thought the final project was a strength and helped in learning and solidifying the python we use. I think a weakness is the inclusion of image manipulation as we didn't use that much besides in one homework and potentially in the projects if one decided to use it.
97988,"Strengths: None   Weaknesses: Very boring and not good for people who have never coded before. Some of the homework assignments were way too difficult for beginners. Also, because of how grading works, your final grade is essentially determined by the exams, which are hard. ALSO, exams are handwritten, which is extremely difficult! (And also doesn't make sense because it is a coding class)"
97988,"strengths:  - homework assignments were very well designed! this is probably going to be a very unpopular opinion but I actually thought the difficulty level of the first few homeworks on basic coding was quite fair and helped me develop the coding abilities that I needed to support me throughout the rest of the class. When the course concepts themselves got harder towards the second half of the course, I think it also made sense for the homework assignments to get ""easier"" in the sense that there wasn't much difficulty beyond application of the already difficult concepts themselves.  - lectures were pretty well organized  - in-class exercises were good - I feel like this class actually helped me learn how to code (unlike the S&DS 230 class I took in Spring 2021)  weaknesses:  - sometimes, lectures weren't the most engaging and the pace was rather slow, or fixing spelling errors in code took away time from explaining the actual concepts being presented  - there were often typos and grammatical mistakes in homeworks and even exams that made them difficult to understand"
97988,"Strengths: problem sets were incredibly good at teaching the material when I didn't totally understand it in class, the material was presented well and I felt like I learned a lot coming in with CS knowledge but little Data Science knowledge"
97988,"I think a weakness of this course was that everything was new this year and so sometimes things were more difficult than I felt they should have been. This improved throughout the year, but in the beginning of the course a lot of the homeworks were too challenging. Also, I felt like we crammed a lot of content in during the last few weeks of the semester on big topics like classifiers or hypothesis tests, but then we learned about small things like text manipulation early and then we were never even tested on it. Also, I feel like the final project was not super beneficial for my learning in the class. I simply used tools from class to manipulate my own data, but the tools I used I had already done in the homework and so I felt it was a bit repetitive. Finally, because the course was so new, I definitely feel like we did not have enough practice problems or practice exams available to practice for exams. When exam time came, I felt like I was guessing what kind of problems I could possibly be asked since I only really had the homeworks to go off of. All that being said, I think a strength of this course was that the professor and the TAs were always available for office hours and to help explain concepts. I did find it cool to learn about some visualizations!"
97988,"I learned how to code basic python, which is what I was interested in. However, the midterm and final were much more difficult than anything that we had done in the class, so it came as a surprise."
97988,"Strengths: We went over each topic pretty heavily, which made them easy to understand in the end. Homework was relevant to each week's content and wasn't too much or too little. Collaboration was encouraged. Slides and answers to the problems we did in class were provided for each lecture. Classes were also recorded. Lowest homework score was dropped. Ed Discussion was used and responses were prompt.  Weaknesses: The midterm and final were both on paper, which I did not appreciate at all considering we did all of our work (and the final project) on the computer. The tests were also weighted as a combined 40% of our grade, which seems extremely high for a format that does not reflect how we learned. I think something more like a timed pset would have been more accurate to what we learned."
97988,"There were a lot of office hours available throughout the week, which was very helpful and convenient. Having OH frequently helped a lot with this course. One weakness, if any is that some of the homework introduced new concepts not discussed in class."
97988,"I think a strength was applying the skills we learned to real data and how to manipulate it. However, I think a weakness was that they we were not given enough time to really hone in on those skills and practice it. sometimes I felt we went way too fast which made it difficult to grasp certain concepts and then apply them in difficult ways. I think it could be improved by slowing down a bit in the beginning of the class and going through practice problems in class that are related to the PSet. In addition, I think assigning something that is the same difficulty of the exams would have been helpful or having practice exams."
97988,"Strength: great teaching and straightforward syllabus Weakness: TAs cancelling last minute on day pset is due, no extensions"
97988,I think this course could have better explanations for some of the concepts
97988,It is well taught using the Jupyter notebooks. I dont think that there is a weakness
97988,Great class
97988,Strengths- engaging classroom materials and homework Weaknesses- lack of confidence in teaching
97988,"class is quite well structured, the psets were really helpful in revising the material gone over in lectures, and the pace was just right for a complete beginner at coding."
97988,everything good
97988,"Strengths: Professor adapts to feedback; the p-sets are purely based on what we have learned; doesn't presume any background in Python. Weaknesses: workload would vary a lot from week to week, so it was difficult to predict how much time one might spend on the class."
97988,"This course said they don't assume prior knowledge but we were expected to learn how to code very quickly, felt less of a stats class and more of a CS course which I did not sign up for"
97988,"Weaknesses: new syllabus and class structure--so did not have any guide or previous examples for major assignments. Also, important topics like machine learning and data ethics were rushed (I think to improve this to speed up the introduction week of Python, and pandas--and maybe making data visualization a flipped classroom module). Strength: the class was paced extremely well with constant revision. The final project also gave us the opportunity to apply data analysis skills to other personal or academic interests."
97988,"I think the pacing could've been improved: sometimes it felt like we spent multiple days reviewing a basic concept (e.g., Boolean masking) and then went through an advanced application (image processing) too quickly."
97988,The midterm was way too hard and did not reflect what we have been learning. The hw were good but the class itself was a little boring. Need take home tests or coding on computer
97988,"Strengths: pretty organized, tons of content covered in a week of lecture. Weaknesses: too rushed, exams were difficult, and I disliked how the exams were handwritten rather on our laptops, should have introduced the different skills/topics in a certain order so the students could have understand the content better considering it's a beginning friendly python class."
97988,The course was disorganized.
97988,Very practical content and interesting applications
97988,"Good Professor, sometimes slow in pace."
97988,"Strengths: homework and in-class problem ""notebooks"" are very well designed and easy to learn from. Exams accurately reflected the course material. Weaknesses: lectures are not very engaging, often spending too much time on topics that aren't very applicable to the skills or testable topics the class focuses on."
97988,"Prof. Meyers tries to keep things engaging with memes and p-sets with funny topics (e.g. squirrels in New York). Occasionally content on problem sets would have difficulty far surpassing what was learned in class which made it difficult, at least initially, to do well/understanding how well content is being learned in class."
97988,Great class; balanced homework
97988,"The course was well taught for a large seminar, as I felt my personal questions were well-addressed despite the class size."
97988,"Strengths: interesting for students interested in statistics Weaknesses: varied pacing of course, instructors not helpful for answering questions, unclear grading and significant change from previous years so that previous reviews were misleading"
97988,"Strengths: The homework is pretty straightforward and Ed Discussion is really helpful, take the class with friends and psets will be easier. The final project was also pretty fun Weaknesses: It was a restructuring of the class so the practice exams weren't representative of the real exams, and there were some bells and whistles still being worked out"
97988,This course did not feel very beginner friendly because there were some foundational concepts we should've learned before moving to more complex practices
97988,"I think the selection of topics for this class was very appropriate for an intro level course. But, it needed to be better organized. Firstly, I think that this class should have a EITHER a final exam OR a final project because there an insufficient amount of time for.both. With about two weeks total to do the final project and the final project draft. Deadlines seems to flow right into one another, and having both is an uncommon experience that I have had in the countless other stem/math/CS courses I have taken both here at Yale and elsewhere. There is also a possibility to rid of one problem set to accommodate for the project, but we were given the same amount of time for out final project draft and final draft as we were for one problem set, which I don't think was fair. It also was difficult because problem sets and the project were not released until the week in which they were due, so if you wanted to get ahead based off the craziness of your own personal schedule, there was no way to do so. Besides this, certain parts of the courses felt unnecessary or disjoint. I think we could've skipped over the text manipulation unit and spent more classes/time on machine learning mechanisms for validating data outcomes. Lastly, problem sets often were phrased very weirdly and/or filled with typos which caused a lot of unnecessary difficulty. There were several instance where peer tutors struggled to assist me because they themselves were confused by the language of the homework assignments. I know this semester, Ethan created a new syllabus. And with all novelties comes imperfections. But despite some policies needing revision or being unclear, Ethan remained unwavering to make accommodations towards the written or unwritten errors in the syllabus. Overall, this class is clearly a work in progress, but it has high potential!"
97988,"At points, lectures moved quite slowly, but towards the end, when dealing with statistics and machine learning, I felt that more time could've been devoted to these abstract topics. I don't think I had quite grasped these things thoroughly through lectures/homework/other resources used. I do think that the homework assignments and final projects were incredibly helpful in my learning. Without these assignments, I feel like I would've been very lost in the class. I also enjoyed how Professor Meyers structures his lectures, incorporating follow-along practice segments, review, and slides of overarching concepts. I loved how we were able to cater our final projects to our interests and that we got input from others before having to submit."
97988,"strengths: teaches coding in an easy to follow manner, course felt organized for the most part weaknesses: not the most engaging course at times, lectures didn't feel consistently digestible"
97988,"While the readings were interesting, they were kind of annoying to complete. Learning actual Python as opposed to a teaching package was useful, but there was definitely a learning curve."
97988,"The professor is highly engaging and the course moves at a reasonable pace. However, the problem sets were often too long."
97988,"This class could use a better feedback structure, I rarely got feedback on my work and I never got my grades back on anything past the midterm exam. Also the last few lectures were jam-packed with too many topics that we could not possibly learn on our own and distill into something we can study for the final."
97988,the course was very new and this less structured than other courses Ive taken within this department.
97988,More homework for statistics.   I felt the final was not representative of the course. I did not think it was a fair accumulative exam.
97988,"The course was being restructured this year, so some problem sets were varying levels of difficulty at the start of the course. However, it quickly became more predictable and clear. The in-class practice problems were helpful and interesting. I do feel that a final project and a final exam are excessive, so I would have preferred to solely have a final project with more extensive requirements."
97988,I enjoyed the recorded lectures and office hours.
97988,strength: good combination of lecture notes and application weakness: people did not start with the same level of experience with coding
97988,"Strengths: very consistent workload, never caught off guard, developed an interest in pursuing data science future (leaves you wanting more), professor adds humor to the lectures, and often a storyline to the p-sets which makes them more enjoyable to engage with.   Weaknesses: some of the p-sets were unnecessarily long at the beginning, but by the end it got better and more manageable, also the p-sets are due on Sunday night, which is not really an ideal time"
97988,"I think the course material was very fun and helped me understand and process these concepts. However, I think that the course was too rushed at the end. The course needed to space out its sections better, so as to not rush important concepts such as hypothesis testing and machine learning."
97988,"The choices of data sets were helpful, and I enjoyed the emphasis on Python programming. I think tying these topics in with Python/R and Excel would be useful, especially for students with interests in economics and finance."
97988,Really good for learning basic python and a little bit of statistics. More of a graphing statistics more. Really liked machine learning and wish we had spent some more time on that/learned it earlier
97988,"One strength of this course is that homework grades were returned within the week, so it was easy to know what you were still not understanding. In lecture, we also learned how to implement coding methods in applications very relevant to todays society.   One weakness is that some topics, such as hypothesis testing, felt a bit rushed, and I wished we could have received a bit more explanation about why we were performing certain functions."
97988,The course was extremely well organized and there were no weaknesses that I could think of. The exams felt a little high-schoolish (given that we had to regurgitate code that we either had memorized or written out on a cheat-sheet). It was less a test of understanding and more about whether we were diligent enough to make good cheat sheets.
97988,"The class is very well organized and you can take it virtually because all lectures are recorded. The last half of the semester felt a bit crammed, and we did not really learn a lot about statistics in the class. I would recommend taking this course after intro to stats or another stats heavy course."
97988,Problem sets were not very challenging but enough to engage a student in the lectures. Wish there were more office hours throughout the week.
97988,strengths:  very organized professor   weaknesses:  I do not like that the course can be taken completely asynchronously. it really affects the dynamic of the course and even of the class. If students have the option to not attend class then they will likely fall behind.
97991,This course is a good introduction to the major however problem sets seemed to not correlate with the lecture.
97991,"I think the major strengths of this class are that learning some of the theoretical frameworks of CS is interesting and some of the problems we covered were kind of fun. Overall though, I don't think Yale's Intro to CS class should be taught in Racket (which seems to be a common opinion) and I think that is a fundamental weakness of this class."
97991,"I loved that the instructor went over the problem sets in the class, it really helped us get a good start and actually understand what each question was asking. My one issue this that some problem sets were due the day after the midterms and that made it challenging to prioritize studying for the midterms."
97991,"Strengths: The recorded lectures were key because I could watch in 2x speed & place bookmarks in the video for every topic, which I later returned to for specific homework problems and reviewing. Problem sets were graded relatively speedily and made it clear what tests you passed and did not & for what reason. Usually the psets were well-designed. Lots of ULA hours, both in person and online.  Weaknesses: You only know if your code is right, not if it's is good. No one looks at your code and tells you if you have bad form, are re-writing functions that are built-in to racket, overcomplicating things. Still, I don't see a way around this in a course so large. Also, Professor Slade is a very slow talker (maybe watch the lectures in 2x speed if you can keep yourself on top of it)."
97991,"Problem Sets and exams, though they cover the same material, implement the material in very different ways, and so bridging the gap between the two was often difficult. Lectures are super slow - much better off watching everything in 2x speed later."
97991,"Very organized and tied in many big concepts together through the use of a relatively unpopular, but useful language (Racket). Teaches a functional language, compared to the popular imperative languages. Weaknesses: there was no incentive to show up to class and watch the material, so lectures were often sparsely filled with people."
97991,Lectures didn't really address topics in class completely but peer tutors were amazing
97991,"It was incredibly disorganized and it was very difficult to see why we were doing certain things. However, it was also really rewarding if you want to learn material on your own."
97991,I think the lecture format can be unengaging sometimes.
97991,"Strengths: Psets are like very satisfying puzzles, though one or two of them were very frustrating. Weaknesses: slow lectures that really drag, many of the ULAs dont seem very invested in being a ULA."
97991,"I think Professor Slade is a strength of the course, even though I did not prefer his lectures. He is interesting and knowledgeable and wants to see his students love computer science. The course content is interesting and enjoyable as long as you are not expecting this to be solely a programming class. I thought the lectures were a weakness of the course as it was often difficult to follow along because the notes are presented in long documents. However, everything is available online and recorded, so this was not too much of a problem."
97991,"Psets were very clear and useful to assist learning the content. However, some midterm assessments felt a bit odd because of the occasional question asking about edge cases. I think its valid to assess those but they dont really represent how much Ive learned and grown in the course."
97991,Prof lectures are dry but pset a are interesting
97991,office hours scattered and unhelpful
97991,Exams on paper so hard
97991,I loved the material of this class
97991,"Strengths - learned a lot about recursion, well organized.  Weaknesses - Racket wasn't much fun to learn at times."
97991,Could improve resources available for additional learning.
97991,"I think that the structure of the class is quite nice. However, I wouldve appreciated it if we had more TAs at office hours. Also, I wouldve appreciated a more comprehensive final as opposed to one that primarily focused on topics from the last couple of lectures, which I did not at all expect."
97991,The strengths are the ULAs that are 6 and help immensely. The weakness is the content of the material that can sometime feel useless in the grand scheme of computer science.
97991,"Fantastic PSETS, interesting material. I found it difficult to justify going to lecture, but great course overall."
97991,"Strengths: well-formed curriculum  Weaknesses: hard to engage in class, psets were poorly explained, difficult to see the value in learning Racket so in-depth"
97991,"Strength is that the classwork is interesting, but the weakness is the timing of the class. In lecture, we would go over material for the next week's pset, while several of us are still working on the current week's assignment."
97991,I think more time on the problem sets due every week could be extended for the course.
97991,Weekly 20-30 hours of work on problem sets is highly anticipated
97991,Racket is actually pretty cool but the testing/debugging features are very outdated.  Slade is a bit of a slow lecturer and most people did not come to class.  The p-sets are very thought-provoking and the class topics are super interesting.  There was only one good ULA (Ben) - the others wouldn't show up to office hours or would just be less than helpful.
97991,This course has some really amazing TAs who are always willing to sit down with you and work out the problem sets.
97991,"The strengths are that all the resources I need were available, and the Problem Sets were very good at helping me learn the material. In terms of weaknesses, I wish there was more engagement in lectures."
97991,I think Professor Slade did a good job of trying to keep the class interesting. The psets were interesting and fun.  I think the practice exams could be much improved as they were from nearly ten years ago and also in the final there were questions about topics we had only glossed over in class.
97991,Lectures could be more engaging but problem sets make you learn materials
97991,I would want more practice material for the exams. We only got like one practice test for each exam and I felt like I really wanted more actual prep.
97991,"The strengths of this course are its topics. I think that the topics chosen are meaningful introductions to computer science, and provide a new student with a thorough recognition of the concepts upon which CS rests. The ULAs are also one of the strongest parts of this course, and were integral to my experience with the course.  I believe it could be made better through a lecture style that incorporates more walkthrough tutorials. One of the most effective parts of the class for me is being walked through basic functions with the ULAs."
97991,"Strengths: flexibility with submission deadlines, class recordings made available, lots of office hours opportunities. I cannot think of any weaknesses."
97991,"There is so much support in this course. There are ULA office hours at all times throughout the week, and the homework is extremely helpful for learning the topics discussed in class."
97991,"The course is very intense and needs a lot of office hours. Although there are many office hours available, the availability of ULAs should be increased during weeks with really hard assignments because the queue gets very long and it is sometimes impossible to get help on time."
97991,I think that possibly more emphasis on programming would be helpful.
97991,I like how this course was a launchpad into the world of CS.  I think the homework testing software was sometimes a little confusing to understand because of the line spacing. Perhaps doing a new line so that each OK is immediately visible would make it more readable.
97991,Soooo much work on the psets. Really time consuming but you do learn a lot.
97991,The online notes and recordings were very helpful because I could not go to the lectures
97991,Better supporting matetials
97991,"- strength: going through psets with the professor before writing them, this helps answer questions and misunderstandings we might have - weakness: l still find it hard to practically implement some of the theoretical stuff l learnt"
97991,"Although many say that Racket is not a useful language, it does have its uses as a basis for understanding higher-level programming languages and functional programming is well-suited to the topics covered in the course. The material is interesting, but lectures arent a great use of your time (hence why they are so poorly attended) and the last problems on later p-sets can be extremely time-consuming and are not even tested on exams."
97991,"Strengths well-crafted problem sets and (with the exception of many UNIX principles), genuinely interesting material.  Weaknesses lectures can be very slow and not quite calibrated with the class's level of understanding (slow in places where people seem to understand, fast in places where people are confused). When many of the lectures take the form of following jupyter notebooks or going through the homework problems, it's understandable that the vast majority of students don't go to class. In addition, the material feels disjointed at moments like we're learning a lot of unrelated principles at once, and none of them with much depth. Since I don't know too much about computer science, I could be wrong about this last assessment."
97991,"One strength of this course is that the TAs for office hours were very helpful. They were very available and were there to help us answer all of our questions. I also appreciated the review sessions that they offered for our midterms and final exams. However, one weakness was that lecture was not very engaging (we just went through the online notes). It would have been more helpful if we had more content review in class as opposed to only learning through examples. Also some of the PSETs take much more time than others, and considering that one of them was right before a midterm was stressful. I also wish this class wasn't taught in Racket. It may be hard to get used to this language during the first weeks of class, but you do get used to it over time."
97991,"Strengths: lecture notes, psets are very fun and manageable, Professor Slade is very kind and knows what he's doing since he's taught for so long  Weaknesses: the lectures can feel a little long or slow sometimes, but they are recorded which is really helpful. I didn't enjoy all of the topics (TC-201), but there were so many of them that I found some I liked a lot too!"
97991,"The problem sets for this course were by far its greatest strength. Though they could be challenging, they always helped reinforce the concepts and were often enjoyable to complete. Most of my best learning in the course derived from doing the problem sets. By contrast, the lectures were often not very good at enforcing material. I think sometimes they were just not engaging enough to really get me to understand the concepts versus just sitting in the classroom and hoping I'd absorb them."
97992,"Prof. Glenn is a good lecturer, and the course has engaging material that is presented well. Psets are mostly manageable but help you learn the material. The biggest weakness is the grade distribution, if you care about that . Prof. Glenn was not willing to curve or adjust cutoffs even though the median on the midterm was a 77."
97992,A strength of this course was that many useful topics were covered.
97992,Strengths: concepts learned are useful in computer science. Weaknesses: very boring. Midterm was unreasonably harsh.
97992,"Strengths: The course was very organized, lots of office hours to get help, PSETs were reasonable.  Weaknesses: Lectures were quite boring. I stopped going to them pretty early on in the semester and just watched the recording in 2x speed."
97992,"A strength of this class was the number of topics covered. It was interesting to learn about each and strive to fully understand them. I think a weakness would be the lack of opportunities to practice what was learned in class (as most practice on one's own was on the graded homework). Instead of lectures consisting just of watching the professor complete problems, I think opportunities during class where students could complete problems first and then have the instructor go over them would be more beneficial."
97992,"Pset grading is BAD. Also need the ability to drop one pset at minimum. Lectures are pretty boring, but follow the psets really well which is a great quality of this course."
97992,"Interesting mathematical concepts that are foundational to computer science. However, there were many weaknesses. The lectures were very dense and hard to follow for students without a background in discrete math. Many of my friends struggled and withdrew from the class. There is usually only 1 ULA during office hours rushing to help 10 students. The psets are not always adjacent and usually a lot more difficult than the lecture examples, so many times we had to learn from websites or youtube to complete the psets."
97992,"This course was horrible. It had only weakness. Quite literally no strengths. The problem sets were too long and difficult to be due every week. None get dropped and you can only submit late 3 times, but then if you do submit late on a pset you're behind on the next one. The midterm was horrendous, and Glenn told us he made it impossible on purpose. The office hours were unhelpful and there are basically no resources to help with any psets. The textbook explains things horribly and isn't even exactly what our class is."
97992,"The strength was that the material was well presented with examples that elucidated it well, but the weakness is that it was very boring and repetitive. The majority of the material was material that I had already learned in high school math classes, which meant that it was not necessary to go to the lectures."
97992,Weaknesses the office hours only had one TA and 15+ students who needed help. The TA would only answer one student's question at a time and independently which made it difficult to receive proper help. Like most Yale classes lecture was one thing and psets a whole different thing (in terms or rigor not content).
97992,"Strengths: very well organized and always stayed on track. engagement was pretty good and the quality of instruction was high. weaknesses: the homework assignments were very difficult for what they are, and are difficult to finish with a high grade without the assistance of office hours."
97992,"Strengths: a combination of unlimited-attempt Canvas quizzes and written portions for the problem sets was very fair. Course moved at a manageable pace. It is a good way to cover a wide range of mathematical topics relevant to CS majors rather succinctly. Weaknesses: office hours were very helpful but not timed very well to problem set deadlines (part of this problem is course enrollment dictating the number of ULAs, so not a total fault). Problem set grading was very slow (4 weeks behind at times, even after the midterm was graded)."
97992,"Notes were pretty poor, and lecturing was pretty bad"
97992,"The topics in the course are quite interesting and I can definitely see the applications of certain topics to computer science, but they can sometimes be unintuitive or difficult to grasp. The course topics sometimes did not seem to be related to one another, which made it harder to learn within the structure of the class."
97992,Strength is that the class itself gets you to think differently about math and the previous knowledge you know about math. Weakness is that it feels like there isn't enough practice/problems to understand the material sometimes.
97992,"I believe there could have been more direction in the lectures as to how to approach some of the problem set questions. I also wish there was more clarity on what could be tested. However, the class did do a good job at covering all the content and making office hours regularly available."
97992,"This course's main strength was its professor. I think the course material is interesting on its own, but Dr. Glenn really brought it to another level. The lectures were actually fun to attend because he is very communicative with those who attend. The grading scheme of the course also allowed you to really learn how to write proofs without being penalized for not being great at it early on. The exams were very fair, and the workload is never overly burdensome. I believe this course was at its best possible form."
97992,"I think this course does a quite good job introducing students to topics in linear algebra, combinatorics, discrete math, cryptography etc"
97992,"Strengths: breadth of topics, late day policy Weaknesses: the grading was unnecessarily harsh compared to other CS courses I've taken here, the instructor was good but not great (and definitely not kind) and the depth of topics made it so I don't feel that I fully understood the topics at all. PSETs were also graded badly (we didn't have 3 PSETs graded at all near the final) and ULAs would say something was correct that would then be graded as incorrect during grading."
97992,"Professor Glenn's teaching was not very good. His preferred teaching style is to use Microsoft OneNote to do ""live math"" and then post that as class notes. This is often very hard to follow from a purely visual point view, as the notes are usually extremely cluttered. The psets often felt a level or two too removed from the class content, and the notation that was used in class and in the Psets was often inconsistent. I found myself going on the answer explanations for psets and not understanding them because of different notation. The psets would usually take weeks to be graded so there was no way to know how well you were doing in the class or what content you needed to brush up on."
97992,"The varying levels of difficulty from pset to pset was something... Sometimes, Glenn just puts all of his effort (on psets and tests) into writing the most conceptually difficult or convoluted questions ever, you spend more time figuring out what is going on rather than practicing the material itself. However, dealing with the logic itself is actually a little fun. Go to office hours if you are struggling, the ULAs are very helpful."
97992,"Strengths were that it was well resourced and the TAs were very helpful. Weaknesses were that grading was vague, there were only 2 exams that made up half the grade with little guidance on how to prepare for them. Glenn wasn't as helpful of a professor with lessons thst seemed very general without going into the larger principles that explained certain topics. I found myself learning more from TAs and on my own."
97992,"Weaknesses: teaching style. The instruction was unclear, everything was handwritten and disorganized, and honestly so so boring. Even after the final exam I am still unclear what I was supposed to learn from lecture, and the homework and exams were much harder than what he covered in class."
97992,"I felt like the course was unstructured. I felt so confused about how concepts related to each other from one class to the next. The assignments we were given were harder than what we learned in class, which was really discouraging as you'd have to spend more time learning during office hours than I should"
97992,"Strengths: Focuses more on CS rather than pure discrete math topics. Weaknesses: This course is a lot more difficult (especially considering the problem sets, exams, lack of notes on exams) when it is taught by Glenn. It is also not super organized, but I think this is common for all instructors. I think this course should be labeled discrete math for computer science rather than mathematical topics as the current name is too ambiguous."
97992,"Glenns lectures were entertaining but not really a good use of your time because he spent too much time on simple concepts, providing involved examples to illustrate them, and not enough time on more difficult concepts. Psets were interesting but quite difficult, and it took forever to get feedback on them. Grading was also extremely subjective. TAs were helpful, and the course was well-structured as far as material and posted notes. Connections to CS were actually emphasized, which was nice."
97992,"Strengths: detailed notes and helpful problem sets and TAs/professor were very helpful Weakness: needed more explanation and practice on the lectures in the latter half (specifically on functions, cardinality, and counting)"
97992,"Very clearly organized course. Materials easily accessible, plenty of office hours."
97992,"I enjoyed the psets and content for the first 2/3s of the course, but had difficulty with the last 1/3 of the course (notes were not as helpful as they were before, psets were difficult to understand, lecture content wasn't as helpful to solve the psets)."
97992,I feel that maybe the teaching could have been taught in a way that isn't too confusing for new comers to discreet math .
97992,Strengths: broad depth of material covered  Weakness : too fast paced
97992,"One of the biggest improvements made to this class was the increase in homework as a proportion of the final grade. With Glenn, it was 50%. Glenn writes very hard psets - ones that I often spent far too long on - but having the two exams only determine 50% of my grade (rather than 70%) was very welcome. Onto the psets, I often felt like they were too difficult, but they were generally lined up with the content we were learning in class. If it wasn't clear when initially attempting, it was very much clear when finished. I think some of the psets could be made easier, as it felt like a few of the psets had the entire class stuck in office hours. Glenn, also, writes bad notes. They're difficult to follow without having to rewatch the lecture. Though the class explicitly references multiple resources (namely Aspnes' notes and a Discrete Math book), they didn't line up fully and so having concise, clear notes dedicated to the current iteration of 202 being taught would be a welcome addition. Also, there should be more linear algebra. Simply learning basic multiplication in one class is not enough for the real world."
97992,"The first review was the night before the exam. This made things difficult, glad that was adjusted for the 2nd, but having a review session a week before or something is even better to help students gain focus on what they need to study before the exam. The 1st midterm practice wasn't representative of tge material on the midterm. There was a lot of content -too much in fact covered after the first half of the course, and the notes became less clear when reviewing them in comparison to the first half. I liked the handwritten notes tho for the most part. Maybe that was a way of making students come to lecture, but even after i came to lecture, i would have to rewatch the class videos nevertheless.I suggest doing preclass videos like the Math Department, optional, but helpful as students co,e into lecture knowing whats up. A strength was that the professor brought creativity into each pset and lecture, like the CHOMP game pset on probability(made it somwhat tougher to understand the principles being taught through the pset like stars and bars, but it also made it fun when u finally got it), the postage stamp pset(induction), the pierogi lectures, the fun predicate logic examples etc. I was kinda sad about the grading situation towards the end, unfortunately, the grading wasnt finished in timefor psets, so psets were rough graded. Overall, this was the 2nd hardest class of my life after SDS238. There were some really tough psets, might be 5 questions, but the amount of time each one took spoke volumes. It was made fun and interesting by the professor, but it's a tough class(a lot of new content), so beware."
97992,"Glenn is too harsh of a prof, and the exams were much harder than the PSETs or practice problems."
97992,Strength: ULA/TF office hours help  Weakness: how engaging the lectures were
97992,"Strengths- I thought the course was challenging and thought very valuable skills like knowing how to prove something  Weakness- I thought the course was taught poorly. The lectures by the professor were kinda hard to follow and jumped all over the place, the problem sets were very frequently a lot harder than what was taught in class. Overall I had a hard time understanding some of the topics cause they weren't explained very well."
97992,"No clarity about grading, course material is interesting"
97992,"Not enough TAs in office hours, not enough office hours, grades on psets returned late and with minimal feedback, notes provided are hard to follow and often lacking"
97992,I thought the course was really poor at managing expectations. Material taught in class was easier than the problem sets. Problem sets were easier than the exams. I was really confident about the class until time came for the exam. I felt relatively cheated about the material that was tested. This is the first class I have felt that way out of the 8 courses I have taken so far. I also had no idea how I was performing on the psets prior to the exam. They were not graded before the first midterm. Psets were only partially graded before the final.
97992,"It is extremely unacceptable that our problem set grades for the midterm and our final were mostly incomplete before the tests. Unlike other classes, there are multiple ways to do a proof, and multiple forms of understanding the question. This class above all others needs to have timely feedback for this reason. Though there were answer keys online, I do believe feedback on our own work and how to do better would have helped me more before my exams.   Professor Glenn is extremely passionate when he teaches so much so he has a hard time sticking to one topic and wanders off when he speaks. I also wish he would post non-marked up versions of his notes because his annotations were kinda everywhere after lecture.   I also wish for the midterm a more comprehensive review would have been given, we kinda just had to figure out what was on that midterm which is hard for students new to the major and Yale in general, which this class is targeted towards. This was improved for the final but I wish it was the case here as well."
97992,"Lectures were solid (and also available online), office hours hosted by ULAs were very helpful, psets were sometimes quite confusing but overall were manageable. It would have been helpful to receive grades and feedback more quickly on the psets, which would have improved studying experience and performance on midterms and finals."
97993,"Better/more engaging live coding, especially in the first half of the semester."
97993,"Strengths: Ozan has a lot of empathy and understanding, and he was very flexible with us. TAs were absolutely invaluable and there were plenty of office hours to attend (at least 5 hours a day). It moves at a pace that is reasonable -- fast enough to cover content, slow enough that you could catch up if you missed a lecture or two. Also it seems like pretty much everyone is going to get an A in the class.  Weaknesses: I will preface this by saying I am sure the class will improve as Ozan teaches it more regularly. But this class was a mess, especially for the first half. The workload was very asymmetrical, ranging from weeks with no assignments or exams to a pset crunch the week before spring break that achieved campus-wide notoriety. The lectures were hard to follow especially with Alan. The psets are too infrequent for us to really grasp the material -- we literally had only done 1 real pset before the midterm. Ed is cluttered and honestly unhelpful. The autograder often didn't work until right up to or even after the due date. This entire class felt very unprofessional and honestly an embarrassment for a school like Yale. Then again, I'm sure it will get refined over the years."
97993,"This course was very disorganized, which makes sense since it was the first semester Ozan and Alan were teaching it. I have faith that it will improve in the following semesters, and the course seemed to improve as the semester went on, but overall the content and instructions were hard to follow and I frequently had to get outside help to understand course content."
97993,"Psets are super fun. Grades were quite generous. ULAs are super helpful. The main weakness was organization, a lot of the class changed around as we were going through it. The course was going through some major changes, so hopefully these are growing pains other students wont have to deal with."
97993,"Strength: Ozan is a great professor. He is very encouraging and is very open to making this class better. The slides for the C++ section were very clear. Ben was also a fantastic TA -- his sections (as well as section notes) made the content a lot clearer. His walkthroughs also made the psets a lot more doable. Side note: The professors/teaching staff are super quick with getting psets and midterms graded, which I greatly appreciated! Weaknesses: This class was a bit disorganized, but I think that is to be expected because it was the professors' first time teaching this course -- and I think they will get better with time. I do think that the psets (especially the initial ones) need to be more clear. I also think that there could be a guide of some sort for all the data structures at the end of the semester (to prepare for the final)."
97993,"Strengths: grade weights, psets oriented to content, overall practicality of content, active Ed Discussion made it easy to ask questions, quick exam grading, weekly sections/pset walkthroughs by ULA Ben Goldstein Weaknesses: lectures could be much more directed on content and less focused on examples, ULA office hours were inconsistent and sometimes ridiculously overcrowded, pset specs were unclear (but only at the beginning of the semester)"
97993,"Strengths:  - Not a super difficult course for people who already have CS experience (especially compared to previous iterations of 223) - Office hours were very abundant - Review sessions were hosted every Wednesday. These were an extremely useful way to learn course content.  Weaknesses: - Lack of organization (due to course being redesigned this year) - Office hours were way too crowded, and students had to wait at least an hour for help - There were not separate office hours just for debugging.  - Live coding lectures were hard to follow along with and not very engaging."
97993,"STRENGTHS: - Professors were really receptive to student learning and feedback. Alan and Ozan put a lot of work into making the course accessible for everyone and adjusted accordingly when something didn't work.  - I really liked C++. It gave me an introduction into object-oriented programming and I saw how it fit well with learning the data structures after dealing with the intricacies of memory and pointers in base C. - Plenty of opportunities to earn bonus points, which helped me focus on learning the concepts instead of just worrying about my grade. Students received up to 5% bonus for attending lecture and up to 3% bonus for answering posts on Ed. I thought this was a great way to encourage attendance and community without punishing those who chose not to. - Shoutout to TA Ben for his weekly sections, which would go over the concepts of each week, live Q&As during lecture, and pset walkthroughs. Should be a model for the rest of the CS department.   WEAKNESSES: - General lack of organization. Resources were kinda all over the place, and Ed became the unofficial hub for the course which was somewhat strange.  - I think the class could've been a bit more difficult overall. I am a bit worried for 323. With the bonus points in place, I'm hoping that the profs can make things a bit more challenging. I would've liked maybe more full programs where we start from scratch in order to gain a better handle of C and C++.  - Maybe too much time spent on certain topics. I feel like we spent too long on the very basics of C and dynamic arrays. If you took CS50, the first half of the course is mainly going to be review for you. Meanwhile, we glossed over topics like heaps and aspects of graphs. There were many concepts that I only understood when I was reviewing for the last exam. - Adding on to the above point, lectures were somewhat unengaging. Alan's lectures mainly involved live coding, but he often spent too much of lecture answering tangential questions. Ozan's lectures felt more applicable since he would often tie it into real world applications, and I preferred his slide-based approach, but he would often spend too much time on a single point.  Many of the weaknesses improved over the course of the semester, and I think Alan and Ozan are working hard towards improving 223 in the future. This was their first try with the class and they implemented sweeping changes to the way it was taught (including introducing C++), so it was expected for there to be hiccups. I'm confident that future experiences in the course will be better than mine."
97993,The course covered many useful topics for Computer Science majors.
97993,The course is decently well-taught and a lot of thought was put towards making the course rigorous and also accessible to newer students. The course was relatively slow in the start of the semester.
97993,"No strengths, nothing but weaknesses"
97993,"I liked that they were flexible, but it was too easy. The lectures were boring and too slow."
97993,"CSPC 223 was my favorite class I took this semester. Ozan and Alan are both extremely caring and passionate professors. While the course had a rocky start, by the end of the semester I was having an amazing time. In the second half of the semester, the lectures were engaging and informative, the homework assignments were clear and manageable, and the grading was a lot more streamlined. While the professors made some mistakes in the beginning of the year, I am willing to excuse those errors because it's their first time teaching 223, and they had to completely rehaul the curriculum and attempt to rebuild it from scratch with little support. And as I said, the second half of the semester was extremely smooth, well-organized, and engaging. I have no doubt that in future semesters, Alan and Ozan will make this course the best in the CS core curriculum."
97993,"organization is the main weakness, strength is lectures are good"
97993,"Strengths: pretty easy, Ozan using slides in the latter half made content and class much easier to follow Weaknesses: professors didn't seem to really know what they were doing. It was painful to sit through Weide lectures and not understand a thing b/c of how badly things were explained. Same q's would get asked and different bad and confusing answers and explanations would be given. Code also always somehow just so happened to stop working during the lecture (but was always working earlier apparently). They were trying new things but we went through content really slowly and still none of it made any sense especially near beginning of semester"
97993,"This course teaches good content but in a very bad way. The course was going through a remodeling so it was pretty bad as lectures were disorganized and problem sets had a lot of errors. The content could be taught in a much better, much more efficient way."
97993,"This class was not hard and the professors clearly tried to make this course better. However, I feel that I did not learn that much, partially because the course was easy. It felt like being late on assignments was rewarded when deadlines kept getting pushed back. The course improved throughout the semester, so that was good. The TA, Ben Goldstein, was amazing - Thank you, Ben!"
97993,"One strength is that the teachers are very good at answering questions, and there are lots of ula office hours. They also give a good amount of review material for midterms. Much of the strength was that this course is changing, and the profs are working hard to make it as good as they can make it compared to previous semesters, unfortunately, this had the downside of being disorganized at the beginning of the semester. But as the semester went on, the class started coming together better. Another weakness would be its lack of support for syntax, especially in the transition into C++. Also I feel like we could fit more content in the semester, as in the beginning it felt pretty slow."
97993,"Strengths - I liked the Ed discussion forum and policy (bonus points for posting comments) which contributed to a more collaborative environment.  Weaknesses - The pset difficulty varied too much from the start and end, not just in complexity of assignment / code length but also time given. So the course structure felt a bit lopsided towards the end."
97993,"I think the content of the course is great. The main issues were lack of clarity on when assignments were due and lack of test scripts. I did not have this problem, but there seemed to be issues with grading work too."
97993,Strengths: EdDiscussion; extra credit; fair exams; manageable psets (for the most part)  Weaknesses: very disorganized and feel like MUCH more could have been covered if it had been organized beforehand; expects strong background of C with minimal handholding (class doesn't exactly teach you C).
97993,"Alan and Ozan care a lot about their students' wellbeing, so they are quite flexible and understanding. However, the course setup and content is really disorganized, which makes it difficult to make the most of this course."
97993,"The strength of the course was that the TEACHING material was well organized and presented to allow the students to easily grasp to concepts, such as resizing arrays, linked lists, and BFS/DFS. Furthermore, the instructors were very responsive and responsible on Ed. They would often answer students' questions and provide updates about the current status of the homework/autograder, which I liked due to the transparency.  However, the main weakness of the course was its lack of organization in the homework. Often, the provided test cases, autograder, or reference implementations (or even, at times, the spec itself) would contain errors that would have to be fixed later on by the instructors, which was very disorganized of them. The autograder also had many errors, especially in the first half of the class, and was very opaque because often, students would have a correct or almost correct makefile, but their code would not compile, and they wouldn't know why due to the opaque error messages from the autograder. It therefore forced students to spend many hours trying to figure out this problem on their own, which I see as a massive weakness to the course."
97993,Strengths include the well structured PSets however there were a few weaknesses too. The course was disorganised with PSet and exam dates overlapping and there were oftentimes errors in the assignments which made it difficult to keep up with.
97993,Cut out ed discussion participation points. Not everyone will have something constructive to say and I think it makes ed a much more disorganized place when people are posting pointless stuff just for points
97993,"There needs to be more organization in the course. Projects would be due in two days and we'd receive a notification that there was an error in one of the test scripts. I understand there were new professors, but I hope for future students that is remedied."
97993,"Very unstructured, too much live coding."
97993,"The Strengths were that the PSETS were great, we didn't go too fast. Weaknesses were the lack of organization, missed material due to slow pace, and sometimes confusing presentation of material"
97993,Strengths: professors seemed like they cared about the students and set up the course to facilitate that. weaknesses: the organization of the course was lackluster and I often found myself learning the content on my own and completing the psets without the help of any of the teaching staff.
97993,I really enjoyed this class and the professors really put in a lot of effort to make the class fun. I think it would be great if each class began with an overview of all the topics and ideas in the lecture so that their is a clear picture about where the lesson is going.
97993,"I really enjoyed a lot of the improvements Alan and Ozan made to this class to make it a less intimidating and more accommodating/accessible course. Especially for students who might not have a heavy STEM background coming out of high school, CS can feel overwhelming and I feel that the class this semester seemed to be more understanding that students come from different backgrounds and tried its best to keep this in mind. Overall, while the transitions were not completely smooth, I think with how much the course was changed they were able to make some good improvements with what was available to them."
97993,"I actually loved this course. STRENGTHS: Alan's live coding was really exciting. Midterms with no final was good, though I wish we could have gotten to three midterms. WEAKNESSES: I did not find Ozan's slide pedagogy that interesting. Psets could have been more difficult or forced us to practice more material."
97993,"Strengths: The ULA, Ben, was great, running sections and review sessions in order to keep us up to speed.  Weaknesses: Way too easy. Grading was too light. Exams could be finished in literally 1/3 of the allotted time, and the problem sets were not challenging at all -- most of the starter code was often given, leaving us with little to no real practice."
97993,I think that the class is definitely informative and provides some really important introductory material for computer science. I think overall it just really needs to be better organized.
97993,"Strengths: material is interesting; sections with Ben were great; Ed was extremely active; some assignments were fun. Weaknesses: I've never taken a course this disorganized. The assignments weren't particularly difficult (some were actually extremely easy, taking only 2-3 hours max), but the constant change of specs, the lack of an autograder (the last assignments didn't have an autograder at all we were given an expected output for some basic cases), and the inconsistent difficulty of the material (we spent many weeks on C basics and lists but not much no graphs, hashtables, and the later part of the course)."
97993,It cant be taught in this room again. Davies or some place with a projector thats lower to the ground.  Felt kinda improvised but I enjoyed the transition from C to C++.
97993,"Strengths: I do think that the teaching staff (the Professors and the ULA, especially Ben) were kind and caring. The bonus points and late days were an amazing gift. I also really enjoyed the recorded lectures and the partially implemented psets (less stressful and it was interesting to read someone elses code). The ED discussion was the most responsive Ive ever seen. Weaknesses: course materials were somewhat scattered, live coding was difficult to follow, and the psets peaked in difficulty/workload in the middle right before the break. The ED was responsive but redundant at some points."
97993,"Strengths: The lectures themselves were pretty good, and I know the professors really cared about making the class as good as possible.  Weaknesses: The problem sets were quite easy, to the extent that I don't think I got better at coding beyond learning some basic new syntax. A lot of the ULAs didn't seem to know what was going on. The course was very disorganized, making most of the struggle adjusting to new information. It was also frustrating when the professors were kinda pushover-y and pushed back deadlines/changed grading/etc so much that it felt like a disadvantage to people who were actually doing the work."
97993,major transformation of the course this semester made it somewhat disorganized but hopefully that gets worked out over time
97993,"disorganized most of the time, but the professors seemed caring"
97993,"It started off with a real learning curve in teaching but ended up on a very strong note. In all, the pace was appropriate, the instructors were accommodating, and the content was challenging. It could be improved with time and some more structure going forward."
97993,"The first half of the course felt disorganized and it was hard to keep up with what was being taught in lectures. However, I enjoyed most of the psets, office hours were helpful and so were review sessions/sections."
97993,"The course, having been newly developed this semester, was overall good. I liked how the exams were very fair and tested the most important concepts in the class, allowing one to assess if they had learned the fundamental concepts. The PSETs were sometimes a little bit too challenging as they seemed disconnected from what was discussed in the lectures. One way to improve the course is to provide some introductory materials to help students learn the syntax of coding in C. Also, because of the large class size, it was often hard to get clear feedback on coding assignments and the directions in which I could improve."
97993,"Strengths: flexible instructors who care about their students, head ULA went above and beyond to prepare weekly discussion section / review sessions, and reasonable problem sets that were relevant to the lecture material. Weaknesses: (dis)organization of class in the first half of the semester and the lack of and/or confusing feedback from Gradescope on our problem sets."
97993,"I often felt like I was fighting against the compiler, even when I thought I understood the theoretical concepts in the abstract. I also often felt lost in class. When my code failed a test, especially towards the latter half of the course, it was not clear _why_ it had failed."
97993,"This course had few strengths. Perhaps its only strength were the slides that were posted following lecture in the second half of the semester. It was extremely disorganized and the lectures were very hard to follow. I felt completely unprepared for the first midterm, as we were given very few studying materials and no practice questions or sense of what kinds of questions might be asked. Nearly every assignment was posted later than we were told it would be, and edited multiple times due to errors. This resulted in hours and hours of wasted time, especially for those who were not procrastinating and started the assignment early. Throughout the year policy changes were made, including allowing people to drop the lowest pset grade. This was not announced until right before the deadline, making it very unfair for those who had already done the extremely difficult and poorly designed assignment at the expense of work for other classes. There were also regularly errors in grading the psets and the expectations were not clearly communicated or consistent. I nearly always felt unnecessarily stressed out and confused by this class, despite attending every lecture and many office hours."
97993,"Instruction was generally good, but coursework was too simplified in my opinion."
97993,The strength was how dedicated Alan and Ozan were to student understanding. That was also the weakness because it ate into class time and it flooded ed discussions.
97993,Structure and schedule not explicit at beginning of year. Live coding in lecture was useless
97993,"I respect the ambition to overhaul CPSC 223 from scratch... but if you are going to take such a huge risk, you *must* deliver. Unfortunately, while I am grateful for and respect their hard work, Professor Weide and Erat fell a bit short, and the course was ultimately messy and rushed. I'm sure there were some elements of past CPSC 223 syllabi that they could have reused, and thereby reduced the risk of fiascos like the HookBook Pset, which dragged on for way too long on a topic that is not that complex (array lists a.k.a. vectors)."
97993,"Strengths: recorded lectures, all the material was posted. Weaknesses: the class felt a bit disorganized, the autograder was never up on Gradescope (which made it hard to test our codes), bad problem grades without understanding why."
97993,"strengths: much more student-friendly vs last semester's, psets were slightly easier and more relevant in terms of both practicality and exam content weaknesses: slightly disorganized at the beginning, deadlines were inconsistent and moved around too often, lectures were not exactly that engaging"
97993,"Strengths: content, availability of assistance  Weaknesses: organization of materials (towards the beginning - it became better at the end)"
97993,"strengths were the grading scheme, it allowed for more focus on assignments rather than exams, which relieves a lot of pressure, and lecture format using slides was good; weaknesses were the organization of class in the beginning, but it got much better after spring break, and live coding during lecture was difficult to follow"
97993,"Very disorganized, syllabus was changed multiple times, lecturers did not seem prepared during most lectures(specially Professor Weide). I think a good way to imprve things is to have all the links and class pages consolidated somewhere from the very beginning."
97993,"Strengths: Content is super interesting and there are plenty of office hours to get help in.   Weaknesses: At least this version of the course was very, very rough in the sense that many aspects were still being figured out as we went which made it very chaotic and hard to follow. The lectures are also a huge weakness. If Allan is teaching, DO NOT GO TO LECTURE. You will end up more confused than initially. Ozan is better but still hard to follow at times."
97993,"Strengths: the material, enthusiasm of the profs, the ULAs Weakness: at first the profs were very unorganized and the pset deadlines were messy, including what test cases existed or not"
97993,The topics and its relevance to computer science at a higher level could be explained better so that we felt like we were learning something important. Office hours were a mess.
97993,"Strengths: I got a good basic understanding of data structures. Moreover, the ULA Ben Goldstein was incredibly helpful with his exam review sessions! Weakness: The class is completely disorganized. Relevant information for problem sets or exams could be found in several different locations and I always had to check all of them to find what I needed, which included the Canvas home page, files, announcement, or Ed Discussion. Ed Discussion had way too many posts and it was hard to find anything. Since Ed Discussion participation was encouraged via bonus points, lots of people really wanted to post as many things as possible, which resulted in repeated questions and several new posts a day near problem-set deadlines.   Professors Weide and Erat mentioned several times the struggles teaching the class because it is their first time teaching it and they are changing the course curriculum. However, many CS students that I talked with previously loved the old CS223, so I do not know why it was necessary to change the syllabus in the first place. I can understand the difficulties for the new professors to teach a new class, but at the same time, I do not think that the students should be penalized for it. I am not a Computer Science major, but I am curious to see how CS323 will be next semester given how this course was structured."
97993,"i think the structure could be improved - a lot of time was wasted so we definitely got an abridged version of the course. i think the lectures could be more prepared, sometimes the professors seemed to trip over themselves in class."
97993,Strengths: Unique psets that seem to be helpful in applying what is learned during lecture Weaknesses: Still less defined course due to new faculty
97993,"strengths: the professors! Alan and Ozan were extremely understanding and supportive of students throughout the course and during stressful times/psets which was really nice to see in a CS class where stress levels can get high. The ULAs were all very helpful during office hours and Ben's walkthrough sessions/recordings were an added bonus I very much appreciate. Mad respect to the professors for restructuring the course to give every student the ability to truly take the most out of the class and succeed weakness: while the psets allowed us to sufficiently practice class material and instill good style practice (and were manageable for someone with little CS background prior to Yale like me) , I often heard from other students that the difficulty of the psets were on the lower side which may be a disadvantage when taking high level CS classes in the future"
97993,"The course, probably because several changes were being made by Ozan and Alan, was quite disorganized. The course material distribution among the first (on pointers) and the second (C++, OOP, data structures, and graphs) halves was quite uneven. This also reflected on the midterms."
97993,"Initially, this class was unorganized in that important files and announcements were scattered across multiple different sites, from Canvas to Gradescope to Ed Discussion. Also, the initial lectures involved live coding which was difficult to follow along with. However, the latter half of the course improved - the lectures included engaging slides and announcements became more streamlined. For the future, I would recommend not using Ed Discussion as a place for announcements and instead using it as just a forum for students and professors to communicate. Browsing through several Ed Discussion forums to find important announcements was not ideal. Both Professor Weide and Professor Ozan are passionate about the subject, however, and always willing to make changes for the benefit of their students. They listened to our feedback throughout the course and it was clear that they cared for the students' wellbeing."
97993,"I think the problem sets themselves are very helpful with learning each core concept of this class. In particular, understanding how AVL trees are balanced was much easier after coding them myself. However, I did think that the lectures were a bit messy and hard to follow, and would suggest using more slides and visuals."
97993,"I thought the course did a decent job given it was very much a tryout of this new format. Both instructors were very enthusiastic and dedicated to the course and its material. However, the course itself was very lacking in many areas. I believe the department tried to make 223 more of an intro course due to the difficulty of the fall semester 223s in the past. In turn, the material and assignments severely lacked rigor and much less content was covered. Furthermore, lectures earlier in the semester were somewhat disorganized and not thought out. I believe 223 should not be designed as an intro course, and doing so didnt really help those who needed an easier experience and also didnt help those who wanted a more challenging experience."
97993,"Strengths: PSETs practiced to concepts we learned in class, but a couple weeks behind Weaknesses: Not well organized course, two professors with different teaching styles, constant errors in PSETs or exams or changes to topics"
97993,"Main strength was the kindness of the instructors and how much they cared about making it better. Main weakness was that they were building the plane while flying it, which is something that will work itself out with time."
97993,Extremely disorganized
97993,"Strengths: Got to learn about two computer science languages and numerous data structures in a short amount of time Weakness: It would have been great to spend more time on stacks, queues, and heaps rather than so much time on arraylists and linkedlists. Before the midterm, I felt the curriculum was a bit unorganized as I could not understand what material we were even covering."
97993,The lectures were pretty boring and confusing.
97993,"It was definitely disorganized at first, although it improved after spring break."
97993,"Weaknesses: I think the most important weakness was that the class never found a good balance of pset difficulty. Most were either too hard or (after the hardest took extensive time and frustration for most people) too easy/handhold-y, and I'm hoping that they find a better middle ground for future years."
97993,"I feel that having slides with pseudo code or explanation help, rather than mostly presenting code without explanation which was really difficult to follow when reviewing the lectures in the first half. Additionally, i didn't like that some exams had major errors, its important to thoroughly check exams before distributing them. You chose a good set of TA's, they were an amazing and integral part which helped me complete the psets. Certain TA's went above and beyond what was required of them . TA's should be paid for overtime and you should regulate the amount of TA's who can sign up for specific slots baseed on attendance data, so that there is a lot of help, especially the week before a deadline. At t HG e beginning, it was the understanding that there woukd be 3 midterms, however, due to not making it thru lect materials, they reduced them to 2 which id something i wrote the first exam unaware(partly my fault but also the instructors fault for not making this known from tge beginning) of..this is really unfair bcz instead if the sxam being 10% it was now worth 15%. Releasing exam practice materials a week or more ahead of time like the 2nd exam would also help absolve you of blame when students don't do as well. Lastly, a strength was that the profs realized their shortcomings, our stresses and frustrations as students and did their best to compansate for them in attendance points, bonus points, adjusting the late policy etc They were more than understanding of student struggles, God bless their souls for that. If they teach the course again with what they hv learned this semester, they'll do great - look to professor Slade, professor JDRS, for additional material in organizing large lectures."
97993,"Very disorganized, bad problem sets and bad exams and bad lectures"
97993,I found the course material quite interesting and lectures were engaging. I do think that the first few problem sets were not as well-organized as the later assignments--perhaps they could be restructured to have slightly clearer expectations.
97993,"Strengths: The topics are taught well. Weaknesses: Organization wasnt very strong and the topics were all simple and straight forward, so we didnt learn very much."
97993,Needs to be more defined lectures. This lecture is pointers. This lecture is arrays. This lecture is linked lists. Just makes the class more concrete and official
97993,"psets were interesting, but im sure grading via gradescope is a work in progress (it was impressive how much the instructors developed this as a first time feature in the course)"
97993,A little chaotic. Feel like the class had additional stress from this.
97993,"Stop live coding, its impossible to follow. The organisation needs to be better as essential information was buried in Ed threads. The course was much better when Ozan taught as his slideshows were much easier to follow."
97993,"One of the weaknesses of this course was the management of office hours. I felt like everyone in the class would show up to office hours, and the TF's then wouldn't be able to allocate a lot of time to helping you."
97993,"I liked lecture, enjoyed the psets, and thought the professors were incredible. The course was a little disorganized since it took on a new format, but overall I really enjoyed the supportive and caring environment."
97993,"Since the course was under redevelopment, it understandably had some issues in the problem sets. I think that the problem sets did do a good job of teaching students how to code. I think that the lectures could be a bit more interactive and the exams could have less stress on them since I don't think exams teach computer science the best."
97993,"i think the course was paced well in terms of material and the instructors clearly care and listen to the students. the weakness is just the organization, which I am sure will be ironed out because this is the first time the course is being taught in this format"
97993,Was pretty disorganized but the instructors tried to make it better towards the end
97993,"Strengths - extra possible points, shift to more understanding by principles in the middle of the course facilitated understanding, and ULA and review sessions helped a lot ; Weaknesses - inconsistent grading"
97993,"Very messy, grading for assignments were wrong most of the time. Professors messed up assignments quite a few times."
97993,"The course content was interesting but the class was poorly structured. Given that the curriculum was restructured this was understandable, but it made the class a little frustrating."
97993,"Strengths: the problem sets were challenging (especially HookBook), but honestly pretty fun to work on and complete, Ben Goldstein's review sessions and problem set walkthroughs  Weaknesses: lecture instruction was unclear more often than not, example code nearly always seemed to have issues, every problem set had a different method of checking for correctness"
97993,"Some disjointed lectures, and live coding was unfortunate. Projects and grading also disorganized. I did learn C++ though!"
97993,All of the hard data structures were mushed to the end of the semester. I wish they couldve spread it out more.
97993,"Very new course - hard to be perfect. Instructors put in great effort to make course work, something I highly appreciated.  An improvement I believe could majorly improve this course is a higher focus on data structures from the beginning. The early parts focused heavily on programming for my course, something that left lots of students behind."
97993,"This course improved as the semester went on, but I think that the first few problem sets were somewhat disorganized, because the course did not have a central website (like CPSC 201), and often I would need to search through the many gradescope posts to find the relevant information. The autograder was also not complete at the time of assignment releases, and for the third pset the autograde was not complete until a day before the deadline, which resulted in a lot of unnecessary stress and scrambling to edit my code."
97993,"Strengths: involved professors Weaknesses: PSETs had flaws in them, lectures ran behind schedule, hit-or-miss ULA hours"
97993,"Strength s: recorded, professors are lenient and want you to help you do well."
97993,The course did a nice job of not making psets more time consuming than they had to be. I would prefer the course to be more rigorous.
97993,"strengths: - assignment deadline flexibility - instructors open to feedback and very welcoming to talk to - new original assignments were good practice  weaknesses: - course was pretty disorganized in terms of mistakes on assignments and not clear deadlines or not clear expectations - too much time spent on dynamic arrays; didn't really do that many data structures in the first half. the second half of the course was very rushed and heavy. learned almost a new data structure every week. went really fast when it came to the complicated stuff like trees, hashtables, queues and heaps, etc. - some of the assignments were 80% implemented and you just had to fill in some of the functions. definitely didn't learn as much on those as i did on the other assignments that i wrote 100% of."
97993,"Strengths: The professors were all geniunely TRYING their best to make this class less grueling than it has been for the past few years, which I appreciate so much. Weaknesses: Information DUMPED, not really that organized and there was always a mistake when a pset was released."
97993,Strengths: Very Understanding professors  Weaknesses: Very Understanding professors to the extent that they made the class so mistake tolerant that it almost hurt most people's learning.
97993,Strength: good assignments (for the most part) that got me more experience in C and C++ Weakness: lectures could be more engaging
97993,"Strengths: the content and information of the course is highly, highly important for CS students and industry interviews Weaknesses: the course was not well organized and lots of times psets had to be revised after they were released."
97993,"Strengths: Ozan and Alan care about the students and want them to succeed. Concepts are interesting, new languages C and C++ are introduced.  Weaknesses: Lack of clarity with problem sets, sometimes too slow/repetitive, badly in need of discussion sections"
97993,"It could be greatly improved by having Ozan teach all the lectures and just having Alan act as a course coordinator. The course was simply too disorganized, and Alan's lectures were incomprehensible. The main strengths were the optional discussion sections, pset walkthroughs, and review sessions led by head ULA Ben."
97993,Better organization and clearer lectures
97993,"Strengths- I feel like the course content was taught pretty well, especially during the second half when things became more routine. The professors were super helpful with answering questions and everything during lecture. Weakness- Since the course got reorganized this semester, the first half of the semester was a mess. Due dates kept changing, and the content we were learning was at a very slow pace. The pset difficult was all over the place. It was either super easy or ungodly difficult (example would be hookbook part 2)."
97993,Strength: the community among the students is very strong Weakness: lectures are not very engaging so it is easy to not feel attached to the class
97993,"Strengths: this class was a very low stress environment, and Alan and Ozan and the TAs were always offering assistance.   Weaknesses: I worry that we did not cover all the material required to succeed in later CPSC classes. This class was noticeably easier than the previous semester, which had its pros (less work, better learning environment) and cons (less material, fewer challenges). In future semesters I would like documentation on problem sets to be more thorough. It was often the case that the instructors would have to release multiple revisions to problem sets, leaving students with less time to work on them."
97993,"Strengths were some of the problem sets, which increased my understanding of working with memory in C and C++. It could be improved by having better organized lectures and problem sets, more of a structured format, faster paced lectures with less time being spent on writing code in lecture and more focus on concepts, and more challenging and rigorous assignments."
97993,"Messy schedules/unclear pset (with errors)/autograder failures. I understand this course is going through some restructuring, but it felt as if we were a ""test trial"" class and thus had to suffer the consequences of the inexperience/newness of the course."
97993,"They changed psets after releasing them, didn't provide proper tools for us to test our code and track errors, and the course wasn't paced very well. Office hours alone was the main resource for assistance they provided, which was understaffed."
97993,The weaknesses of this course are the lectures. the professors don't make learning fun.
97993,"Because of changes that this course was going through during Spring 2023, the class was a bit unorganized, especially with the psets and the beginning lectures. Live coding during lectures confused students further because we sometimes got sidetracked and couldn't didn't know what the most important concepts to remember were. Later on, slides presentations helped alleviate this issue, but it was still not completely clear (the slides were a bit cluttered). I think there could be more emphasis on which concepts are most important, like the Data structures, their functions, and their respective runtimes. Due to organization issues, we might not have covered as many data structures as we were going to. Also, since this was the debut of many of the psets we did, there were some major issues, but these will likely be fixed for the future."
97993,have assignments completed before uploading
97993,"Strengths: cool content, the professors are good guys, seems like its headed in a good direction, positive vision for the future, helpful ULAs, some of the lecture slides are really good Weaknesses: standard new class challenges with the autograder and class organization, but the profs are genuinely committed to making it better, and I think we ironed out most of the bugs this year"
97993,"in class coding should be reduced, or more tailored to what will be on the psets. towards the end of the course, the turnaround for psets was really tight and a bit unmanageable at times. professors had to provide multiple class-wide extensions around midterm and finals, which perhaps indicates that we didn't have enough time to complete the amount of work assigned. greater explanation of how these data structures are used in computer science would have also been appreciated, the concepts feel very abstract and I'm not quite sure when I would use them outside of the psets (but I'm also not a cs major so maybe its just me)"
97993,"This class was one of the most disorganized classes I've been in. The project specs were incredibly vague and some (namely, HookBook Part 2) did not give students appropriate time to write and test their code. The course did not have a functioning auto grader for most assignments, resulting in students getting low scores for minor formatting errors. As a symptom of the vague project specs, office hours were flooded, with some assignments having 150+ students attending (the class is 264 students), even several nights before the pset was due.  A pset was assigned to be due during reading week, the day after Spring Fling.  In terms of the lectures, there was too much ""live coding"" during Alan's lectures which was hard to follow for 75 minutes.   This class may have decent course evaluations, but that is because the overwhelming majority of students got an A in class, not because it is a well-taught course. Even as a student who got an A in the class, there were massive headaches throughout."
97993,"It was a little unorganized and messy, with lots of random extensions and a seemingly scattered curriculum. The homework assignments were very unpredictable, with some being extremely easy and others taking 20+ hours to complete. However, the teaching style was nice and the disorganization was acknowledged; lots of feedback quizzes were given to us, which makes me optimistic for the future."
97993,"Better organization on behalf of the staff I feel. I also think that there were some very difficult and important algorithms and concepts taught at the very end that appeared on our second midterm that you did not necessarily need to know C++ for but were reserved for the end and not flushed out in detail. I think if the class sticks with a twice a week format, that the days should alternate: one day for concept and another day for coding.   The biggest weakness I realized later is when they had a ULA teach a supplement class on Wednesday night, but I had a class then! I should have been able to see this supplement in courses.yale.edu so I could register and prepare space for it! I would have done much better in the class I think if I knew ahead of time of this resource before class selection deadlines. Supplement classes should be visible to students well ahead of time and/or have the option to register for.   I will say both professors were very receptive to student feedback and gave us extensions, curves, advice, and help in ways that went above and beyond my normal classes. They do care, I just think they got some things wrong that should be improved."
97993,"While the course staff were all very helpful and supportive, the overall structure and pacing of the course could be a bit disorienting at times. Assignments would be altered or delayed often, there were hiccups with the overall course structure, as well as other problems. However, even with these hiccups the course staff really put forth the effort to course-correct things when problems came up, as the structure and flow of the course was a learning experience for all that were involved."
97993,This course had really interesting programming projects. At the beginning of the course however this course was a little disorganized which made following along occasionally difficult.
97994,would be better if more more humanities knowlege related to the project theme could be given parcitularly to the humanities majors
97994,It was a good course.
97994,Interesting content
97994,Strengths: Pretty easy and interesting especially in the second half Weaknesses: The first half had too many history lectures.
97994,Strengths: Group project is a real perk of doing this class Weakness: Group project needs to start earlier
97994,"The course does a good job of connecting technology to humanities research and spends a good amount of time letting both the CS students and humanities students reach a baseline knowledge level in both fields. I wish we had a bit more support for the projects since we were just given general directions, and we would have struggled with getting the project done if most of us didn't have prior experience with the technologies used. The lectures are also a bit bland since a lot of it was going over PowerPoint."
97994,The course had a lot of great readings and lectures but a more rigorous treatment would be good. Participation was fairly low.
97997,I really liked the discussion sections and some of the readings. I feel like a lot of the homework felt somewhat meaningless - the coding parts were easy for the sake of the polisci students and the short answer questions were easy for the sake of the CS students - but I still got something out of them.
97997,Strengths are the relevance of the topics and the professors; weaknesses are that nobody attends lecture so sections are a waste of time.
97997,I loved the almost seminar-style lectures and was very engaged with the content. Homework assignments felt disconnected from the course at times (trying to learn an ML package on our own was not as exciting) but were all doable.
97997,"The weakness of this course is that the course lends itself to interpretation and personal opinions (although there are certain facts and policies we must know); however, although it lends itself in that manner, the way the course was designed did not allow for many room for error. Thus, any mistakes on an exam or homework was very costly which I did not like and I can assume most of my peers also did not enjoy. It deterred us from enjoying discussion."
97997,"Discussion was much more preferable to lecture content, which we had comparatively less of"
97997,"I thought it was bizarre that the problem sets had almost nothing at all to do with the lecture material, with a few exceptions. Several of the assignments were arbitrary programming exercises with very tangential relationships to the issues being discussed in class. I wasn't too bothered by this as I do a lot of programming anyway as a CS major, but I could imagine a less technically inclined individual interested in the political side of the class being befuddled by having to process spreadsheets with Python scripts or train a decision tree classifier for practically no reason."
97997,strengths of the course are that it was a manageable workload and the teaching was excellent.
97997,Strengths: Feigenbaum is a pretty good lecturer. They both also make a strong effort to include discussions in the lecture Weaknesses: Hardly anyone showed up to lecture which was unfortunate. There was very little coding involved in the class as well. Mostly just material on the law and politics of it.
97997,"Strengths: topics were interesting (by their own merit, not necessarily through the professors'), last two psets weren't too time-consuming and also quite fun, professors were fun to talk to individually, tests are pretty straightforward Weaknesses: very little buy-in because class didn't feel personally applicable, first two psets had little to do with what we learned in class and were very time-consuming"
97997,The greatest weakness of the class was the fact that students were generally totally disengaged. Many did not show up to lecture or participate in section. I wish there was a mechanism to select for more interested students (maybe this should be a seminar?)
97997,It's an interesting topic and minimal coding if you are looking for that in a cs elective. I think it would be interesting to have more hands on work on something related to content moderation
98001,"The course is very well taught. The lectures focus on more theoretical concepts and then the psets require you to implement these concepts and get actual programming experience. However, the homework assignments are incredibly long and time-consuming: in my opinion way more than is necessary."
98001,"Strengths: well-organized and lots of support from TAs and ULAs. The material is very interesting and Professor Lim did a great job making it somewhat approachable. The problem sets are very tough but they do teach you a lot of information about how computers actually work and help to reinforce concepts in lectures. Weaknesses: the problem sets are every 2 weeks, so typically you have one week that's manageable and the next week is very time-consuming, but that's not an issue with the course and more an issue with students. I think that review sessions before the midterms would be very helpful. I also think it could be helpful to explain to students after the problem sets are graded how and why their code could be improved for the future because sometimes a grade was given with no explanation as to which tests were passed vs. failed."
98001,Strengths: - The problem sets --> each problem set felt very well curated to teach the concept at hand  Weaknesses: - The slides felt disorganized and very difficult to review off of
98001,"difficult - definitely takes a lot of time pset-wise, and the concepts are not easy to grasp either. But the course it set up in a way that you are able to get support. I do think the class covers a lot and it's hard to fully grasp everything, but the ULAs are great and the community is great as well. I wish there was more preparation or materials to help get ready for exams."
98001,"Strengths: Depth at which material is covered - each subject is covered enough to feel satisfied without going into so much depth that it overtakes the rest of the course. Quality of assignments - each assignment is so well made and is perfect for solidifying and furthering my learning of the material in class. Grading - This course is weighted in what I feel to be a very fair and supporting manner; there are plenty of opportunities to boost your grade, the structure of the psets and tests are layed out clearly beforehand, a relatively fair amount of the course is weighted towards psets vs. tests, etc. Teaching staff - both Jay and the supporting ULAs were great for this course, office hours were helpful and lectures were very engaging. Weaknesses: I don't have any real gripes with this course. Some of the pset can be particularly frustrating, but I think that is the nature of computer science. I would have really appreciated it if the WeenzyOS and the final project had more convenient ways to debug in the user space but I don't think that is something that is easy to change."
98001,"The course is modularized well. Each unit you have something to learn, and each unit minimally relies on previous units (except for 2 of them). It was really fun doing a coding pset in each unit to practice the material and grasp a better understanding of how everything works. The office hours are AMAZING!!!! They helped me so much throughout the course. You can never fail to learn something; it just depends on the amount of time you put in. The contents are easy to understand but pretty procedural, unlike high level math. I don't see weaknesses as I resolved all my confusions through online searches and office hours. This is an intro class, so the knowledge are not that in depth. But there is one weakness I just noticed: I HATE the test cases in pset. These cases are literally randomized so sometimes you get bad public cases and it takes 324q89p5170598345234 times to figure out all the private cases. Although it's a good practice to write private cases and understand the materials better, but l'm too lazy to be wanting to do that ;-;"
98001,"The psets are very difficult, but ULAs are very helpful. Lectures are similar to 223 in terms of other cs classes in terms of style."
98001,"Give feedback on projects, more exam practice, and put an updated syllabus on the Canvas page."
98001,I wish that the lectures prepared us better for the problem sets. At times it felt like that the lectures had very little to do with the knowledge required to do the problem sets. I wish the lectures focused more on practical code examples rather than just theory.
98001,I think more detailed slides would be helpful but the material was very clear and assignments were too.
98001,"great course, very rewarding. Sometimes wish that test cases (or at least descriptions of test cases) were provided so we knew what we were missing points on. Grading on project 5 seemed especially toughdespite programming the entire project, I must have had a mistake in the very last step, causing me to fail the 5 private test cases, and I only got a 55%.   I *very* much appreciated the grading policy, curve, and extra credit opportunities in the courseif you feel that you are not a good test-taker, do not worry because the two exams will NOT tank your grade"
98001,"It's a very hard course! I can't think of apparent weaknesses in this course's design; the volume and difficulty of the material and problem sets just seem to make this a hard course. I liked the pace of lectures, and I thought Prof. Lim was a pretty good lecturer."
98001,"The psets are designed to help you learn the material. The later psets are outlined in a way to facilitate your progress. Overall the lectures cover a good amount of material, but what we cover is not always relevant to the psets."
98001,"I think the course had good projects and definitely forced you to get familiar with the material, however I think the test structure is very feast or famine, and not necessarily indicative of genuine knowledge."
98001,"Strengths: Great professor, plenty of opportunities for extra credit, manageable workload   Weaknesses: Only weakness I can think of is the time allotted for the exams. 30 more minutes would have been helpful."
98001,"It is extremely rich with material, but also takes a ton of time and effort. I wish the PSETs were more related to the lectures and I wish the PSETs had a drop or some late days to provide some leeway in the already extremely difficult curriculum."
98001,"Strengths: Covers lots of useful interesting concepts with systems programming and computer architecture. Good pacing for coverage of the concepts. Strong support system. Very in-depth and engaging psets. Weaknesses: Somewhat of a disconnect between the lectures and the story of what the slides are trying to tell sometimes, sometimes questions about concepts are answered with a very ""hand-wavy"" or vague answer.  My largest quip is that the midterm exams are quick sprints for computation and recall with very limited time rather than testing for deep conceptual understanding. I think it would be much more useful to pick a few topics for long written response-type questions to encourage deep understanding of the material, which I've seen with previously posted content for the course. Anecdotally, the midterm exams are so surface level and dependent on easy computation that I've seen someone get by with an A in the course by beginning to watch lectures a few days before each exam without a deep understanding of the content."
98001,"For all the time the course takes, it is well run with incredible office hours and ULAs. Professor Lim is a great and engaging lecturer as well and psets are interesting albeit absurdly long."
98001,"I think that the difficulty of this course was just right for me, and the content was taught in a way that made it pretty easily understandable. The PSets were graded very efficiently and quickly, although I sometimes wish that the grading system was better explained."
98001,Strengths - the lecture quality at the beginning was exceptional. The quizzes were well organized to make it so that we could learn on our own succinctly. PSETS were well spaced out and with office hours aplenty to keep us from falling behind. The course was also quite nicely paced overall; did not feel too fast or slow.   Weaknesses - towards the end the lectures got a bit more sporadic in terms of quality.
98002,"Good Psets and ULAs. Lectures are atrocious and disorganized. Course needs a complete overhaul and to actually make the stuff interesting, which isn't difficult. I read the text book and watched people teach it on youtube, and it was 10 times more enjoyable."
98002,"Good coverage of a wide range of topics in OOP, interesting assignments"
98002,"I really enjoyed this class. It is very relevant and probably one of the more applicable CS courses Yale offers, and I say that as a graduating senior after taking 15 CS courses."
98002,"I think that the course material is very beneficial and will be very beneficial to my future, but I feel that a lot of the material was rushed at the end."
98002,"Strengths: Concepts are interesting, lectures are informative, homework is not too hard and useful for putting the concepts from class into practice. Weaknesses: Not many. Lectures were a little dry at times."
98002,"If you dont have extensive programming experience with Python or object-oriented programming (ie. Your only experience is 201 and 223), this course will definitely arm you with some industry-ready skills that are great to learn. If you already know the basic ideas behind OOP, youll likely find the first half of the course dreadfully boring. I did appreciate the unit on testing since almost every other Yale class ignores the idea of testing altogether. I also appreciated that the course felt well organized. Assignments were released on time and each provided a Gradescope autograder to validate basic functionality."
98002,"Strengths - good lectures, assignments, and fair exams. No weaknesses."
98002,All weakness no strength
98002,"Strengths: psets are awesome, I actually had fun with them. Cool how they approximate real world applications and require us to practice code organization, modularity, etc.   Weaknesses: The c++ portion didn't feel as well thought-out as the Python portion. Probably bc there was necessarily more focus on syntax. I don't know if the C++ crash course was worth it over going more in depth actually implementing design patterns in Python code, as an exapmle."
98002,"Strengths: The class material is introduced in a logical manner and it builds on itself. Class material and examples are all accessible on Canvas, and assignments are well documented.  Weaknesses: One weakness was that the lectures weren't too engaging."
98002,"Overall the course is well structured to facilitate learning. The combination of homework programming assignments with lecture quizzes is very effective at reinforcing lecture content. The programming assignments are always interesting and to do and are immensely useful as they are very close to real backend programming situations and specifically teach you to use widespread important Python libraries such as logging, GUI toolkits, unit testing, and interfacing with SQL databases. However, it didnt make a lot of sense to present a rapid-fire sequence of OOP design patterns at the very end of the course when we only had one assignment in which to apply them. The content sequence would be more logical if design patterns were presented before specific libraries such as logging, GUI, and SQLalchemy, and this would allow students more opportunities to practice applying design patterns. Also, exams placed too much weight on memorization of details from lectures that were not relevant to the programming assignments and were therefore not reinforced. It would also be very helpful if later programming assignments explicitly supported C++ to provide students with an opportunity to choose which language they want to practice more."
98002,"The office hours times sometimes felt odd, so I couldn't attend them that much. Regrade requests can take some time before they get responded to. The crash course on C++ could be improved I feel like. I did like how straightforward Tim Barron's slides were."
98002,"I think the design pattern content was really helpful and honestly makes me feel like this class should be mandated for the CS major.   Weakness: the format of the lectures, I just didn't process all the code and content in the lectures. I could tell the rest of the class was also not following along, but I'm not entirely sure how to improve that. Maybe more comprehension check poll questions, and if the majority of students don't reply with the correct answer then reviewing the material?"
98002,"Great lectures, tough exams"
98002,"A strength is that this course feels like one of the most practical electives offered in computer science such as object-oriented programming, design patterns, git, and databases. A weakness is that sometimes it felt like there was too much material for the course and we were rushing through topics."
98002,"Second half of the class was not relevant to industry, C++ part was way to heavy for what was advertised"
98002,Way too fast towards the end; the design patterns were covered far too quickly
98002,"Strengths: very useful skills for real-world programming, lots of information taught, good resources available. Weaknesses: difficult to pay attention in class - unchanging pace made worse because this semester it was a 9AM"
98002,The course covers a good amount of material and I felt I learned lots. It could have been supported by more structured revision notes. This is especially the case for areas where online materials are scarce (eg online documentation of TKinter is terrible; I needed to buy a supplementary textbook).   The course was a touch dry - but thats perhaps the nature of the material and I still found I improved considerably throughout.
98002,"The class content is useful, however not very challenging or intellectually stimulating. Lectures were boring, and compulsory live attendance made matters worse. Quizzes were tedious, and pointless, as attendance was taken anyways. Class needs more TA's. Would not take again, no matter how practical the content is. Could have been self taught in a few weeks."
98003,"The course is presented via interesting and informative lectures, and the homework assignments reinforce the concepts."
98003,"Strengths: Prof Manohar is a great, engaging lecturer. Labs are pretty relevant to the content we cover in class, quizzes were a low stakes but meanginful way to keep in check with the ongoing content. Weaknesses: seems to be designed and catered to Engineering students, pure CS students who had no engineering background had to catch up on some ideas on their own, somewhat unclear expectations for the final project (compared to the other labs that had very detailed deliverables that were centralized on the course webpage)"
98003,"The labs were fun and helpful in solidifying the concepts from class, lectures were very interesting and easy to follow if you come to class. Professor Manohar is a great lecturer, if you're interested in embedded systems or just want a fun upper level CS class I would definitely recommend."
98003,"Rajit Manohar is this course's greatest strength. Beyond his clear expertise in and passion for the course material, he used humor and anecdotes to make long lectures engaging."
98003,The projects were pretty hands-on and taught me a lot. I had a lot of fun working on the final project too. The quizzes were good to keep in loop with the course material but were a little annoying (and not always easy). The exam was hard and sometimes the project specs would lack enough context. Overall I learnt a lot and would recommend the class still!
98003,"Maybe less of a coding emphasis, especially as it is only an elective for Cs and it is a requirement for EE...."
98003,Strength: this is a great class. Very rewarding.   Weakness: oh my god the assignments were difficult. They GREATLY overestimate EE students ability to code in C. The midterm was horrible for the EE students as it was all software. I wish there was more of a hardware focus in this class.
98003,Very hands on course where you actually apply what you learn in class in the systems you build.
98003,I really enjoyed the labs although I recommend having a partner picked out. I found the lectures were a bit complicated if you havent taken 323 and it may be hard to follow. Lots of information though and final project fun. Midterm was ridiculously challenging
98003,"Strengths: Manohar is one of the best lecturers I have had in the cs department. His knowledge and ability to explain complex concepts is apparent in lectures and you can tell that he cares about our understanding of the topic. The labs were very connected to the course material, and I loved the open-ended nature of the final project."
98003,"The structure of the class is good, and the content gives a good overview of how computers and microcontrollers operate. The weekly quizzes are a nice addition: they are not too hard and can be answered without too much difficulty if the student pays attention in class.  Grading for this class can be improved. The grades come in quite late and so it's usually not possible to obtain feedback in time to improve on the next assignment. The midterm exam was also quite a difficulty spike compared to the quizzes and the assignments, and I think more could have been done to prepare students."
98003,"Major strength is Professor Manohar. He makes lectures engaging and paces them just right. The labs are also really interesting and some push you conceptually while others are more classic arduino projects. The only criticism I have is that some sections of labs or questions on the midterm were phrased in ways that appeared far more complex than what was actually being asked of you. What is actually expected of you is very reasonable, but this can sometimes make coursework seem daunting. f.e. there were times I thought I had to design entirely new protocols, but the reality was I just had to modify old ones. Overall an incredibly strong class though, and one you will be grateful to have taken."
98003,"Strengths: Professor Manohar is an engaging lecturer with a lot of knowledge about his field. Expect to learn not just how things work but why people build them the way they do, and the history of how we arrived at current designs. The labs are reasonable workload-wise, and extremely helpful for understanding the material discussed in lecture. In the last lab, I implemented concurrency, using an interrupt to context switch between different processes, and as a result I have a good model of concurrency in my head. In a different lab, I needed to get accurate input from a rotary encoder, and now I have a mental picture of how rotary encoders work, down to the wiring. Weaknesses: Feedback could have been more detailed, and grading was a little slow - I wish we'd gotten feedback on the first lab before submitting the second. Office hours were sometimes less helpful than they could have been - I remember showing my solution for part of a lab to a TA, the TA saying it worked, and then subsequently losing points for not doing the assignment properly."
98003,"Strengths definitely included the Labs and Final project - both were fun and felt much more like cool projects than homework. I think the lectures themselves could be weaknesses, especially with topics such as concurrency which were the most conceptually difficult. More practice or time spent learning actual implementation in C would have made the lab easier."
98003,"Overall, I really enjoyed this course and its content. I do think it would be better if it was taught somewhere else (not in the basement of hillhouse)."
98003,"If you are an EE major, be prepared to get screwed. You are entering computer science land. First of all, you can't just go to class and do fine on the quizzes. That was a total lie. Also, there's a lot of figuring things out yourself on the labs, so be prepared to take more time than you think with those, and honestly for the harder ones it is not worth trying to do on your own - definitely consult solutions for those. The midterm was simple in theory in its questions, yet I didn't know how to do anything on it because I feel like I did not gain an intuitive or concrete understanding of the inner workings of the computing machine as he laid out for us in lecture. Like I could not tell you when a flag is used, what functions do in the machine code, the current process, the stack pointer vs the normal pointer, which is kind of sad, because I feel like I got close to knowing what everything does, but I just had no framework to put all of these things together because he only ever talked about computers in theory, and he never showed us examples of how stuff might come together in a real computer. And all of the queuing stuff was interesting, but again I feel like we never used it for anything and I don't really know if my implementation of it would ever really work. And I never really understood why accessing a critical process would fail during some implementations and not others. Idk maybe I should've asked more questions in class but I just always left class more confused about everything and never really got it all sorted out. Manohar's a good professor and he cares, but if you're stupid and are going into this blind like I was, know that he will assume you know much more than you do and that you have way more time than you do."
98004,Better.
98004,"The class teaches useful things, but only in the Spring. Thankfully 365 is now being offered in the fall as well, but I want to state that the class that begins with a spiel about how algorithms are useful for interviews and is also required for the major probably shouldn't be offered only during the Spring semester."
98004,"Lectures can be given more succinctly, but otherwise very understandable."
98004,"Lectures make material easy to digest, I appreciate how pset problems try to create real life scenarios for the algorithms, and the bonus questions were interesting to solve.  I wish more of the pset problems asked for brief justifications rather than complete proofs. The vast majority of my time for homework was spent on the write up instead of solving the actual problems."
98004,"The course is pretty well-rounded overall, and there is adequate support for everything you're being assigned or assessed on."
98004,"Good PSETS help you learn and apply content but aren't too much. Lectures are helpful but sometimes are just talking through drawn-out proofs, which can be interesting but if you're not engaged can equally be unhelpful and not relevant to PSETS/exams."
98004,"Strengths: great ULAs who are all extremely helpful, discussion sections. Weaknesses: lectures were a bit dry, but that is most likely due to the content matter itself and not a reflection of the teaching staff"
98004,"Strength: course lectures were great and very informative. Weakness: the course organization was rough. Grading was on a nearly one month delay (with multiple problem sets returned after the final exam), and homework assignments often required some correction. ULA/TF support was sufficient."
98004,"good problem sets and exams, good lectures but a little slow"
98004,"Dylan is a great instructor.  Frequency and quality of office hours is very good.  The preparation and information about what the exams would look like leading up to them could be improved. Before Midterm 1, for example, a very hard review was released, which did not end up looking at all like the exam."
98004,"The only weakness of this course is that I feel it could be significantly improved if there were practical coding assignments that allowed us to physically implement the algorithms taught in class. This could extremely help with job interviews and preparation. However, I do see the appeal to not having it as well."
98004,"Strengths: The course was well-organized and I really enjoyed Prof. McKay's teaching style. The opportunity to view the classes remotely was helpful if you weren't able to make it to class, but did also result in low attendance to lecture. A lot of good support at Office Hours. The grading was quite nice and I felt that most people generally did well. The leniency regarding late days was also very helpful. Weaknesses: Low class attendance due to virtual recording option."
98004,It got kind of boring sometimes
98004,strengths: A lot of help from a great stuff of Ta's   weaknesses: The lectures were did not prepare the student enough for the pests or for the exams
98004,"This is among the worst courses I have taken in three years at Yale.   First of all, the class was far too big, which caused the instructional staff to be stretched far too thin, and therefore it was extremely disorganized. As a result, many of the graders were basically skimming and gave far too lenient grades and, more importantly, did not give the necessary feedback for students to learn. Of course, this was more an administrative failing than any one individual's fault: it seems that the administration's on-again off-again support for the course forced Dylan to spend way too much of his time as a personnel manager and not enough on actually teaching the course.  There was no incentive to attend lectures, and practically no-one did. Dylan's lecture style, particularly his cadence, is difficult to listen to. He did his best to make lectures interactive, but the class was so unengaged that it was not usually very successful. All of this meant that most students found it easier to learn the material from other sources: ULAs, the internet, the textbook, or ChatGPT.  It was easy to do very well in this course without attending or even watching the lectures, partially because Dylan repeatedly allowed students to bully him into being far too lenient with grading policies. CS students at Yale are needy and greedy, and rarely take no for an answer; Dylan found it difficult to make unpopular grading decisions early on, which led to a culture of students trying to take advantage of his benevolence over the course of the semester. To his credit, he was strong on the second exam, but it was too little, too late. Based on the amount of effort that I put into this course, and the amount of material that I learned, relative to other courses I have taken of similar level, I should have received a much lower final grade than I am going to."
98004,"Strengths: - Dylan's lectures and slides were extremely clear and made the material relatively easy to digest - The availability of office hours and ULAs was great. That can be really hard because the class is huge, but I never felt that I wouldn't be able to get the help that I needed.   Weaknesses: - There were too many problem sets and the grading for each problem set was too slow. It was difficult to integrate feedback from previous problem sets because they just generally came too quickly."
98004,"Strengths: good lectures and PSETS, weaknesses: exams were a bit difficult"
98004,"The course was very well taught and students were prepared well for tests and problem sets without detracting from their challenge. Any weaknesses seemed to be from the fact that this was the first time this professor taught this course, but he is very invested in listening to feedback and improving."
98004,"Strengths: good and relevant content to technical interviews which is nice, taught pretty well, many many ULAs to help in office hours Weaknesses: very proof intensive, wish it was even more applicable to technical interviews as I found the content to be very theoretical"
98004,Dylan is a rude professor and I felt that he did not care about his students
98004,"strengths: well organized, really good transparency, good support for students weaknesses: some harsh grading tas were sort of strict on regrade request"
98004,"Bad. Lectures were not worth going to. Extremely slow pace in both material and speech. I would get it if this was your first exposure to the math-based perspective this course takes on algorithms (the algorithms themselves are not hard), but in my opinion this would not have been a problem if 202/244 or the other prerequisites were more rigorous in this regard. I am sure I'm not the only one who felt the class was way too slow and felt that I wasn't learning anything, and I've never studied this material before.  That said, I wouldn't complain if I felt that the entire class was easy, but because the homework problems were fairly long, and most of the actual ""challenge"" was in intuiting the algorithms (although the majority of them were close to trivial), doing the weekly homework quickly became a chore. In retrospect, it seems the best strategy for maintaining your grade in this class was to go to office hours and nag at the ULAs until they fed you the answers, without understanding any of the material yourself. Essentially, the homework is more than doable, but it feels like a waste of time to do them yourself when people who clearly do not understand anything being taught can do the problems *faster* than you by sitting at OH 3 hours a day. The expectation is that you get a 100 on every homework, and it is ridiculously easy, but very frustrating, to do so.  Overall terrible class that seems to motivate against high achievement and actual learning."
98004,"The course is very well organized and I received help or guidance almost every day! At the end of the semester, I felt that I learned so much and had a great time engaging with the discussed topics. We had many office hours and discussion sections that may further help the students review once again, more in detail, the concepts discussed during the lectures, or work in teams on ideas for the problems on the assignments, or simply discuss interesting topics in algorithms design and technical interview questions. All the problem sets tested rigorously the understating of the material and developed my creativity in finding a solution to an algorithmic problem."
98004,Strengths: the teaching staff works hard to accomodate students and to provide helpful resources. Weaknesses: The lectures are a bit slow paced and not especially engaging.
98004,"The lectures are very fun and engaging. The slides are well organized. There are only 3-4 homework questions every pset, and they offer great practices on the current topic. Even though each pset is weekly, it only trains you on the material of the week, which reflects good modularization and knowledge reinforcements. The course also offers a lot of resources and help. However, this course is structured like a math class, so homework can be challenging as developing algorithms require intuitions. However, that's the fun of algorithm. They phrase the problems in such a fun way that it feels accomplishing to solve one. It really trains your brain think more efficiently. You don't need to use LaTex to write a formal mathematically and symbolically proof. Typing your ideas out in a google docs is sufficient. I love that leniency."
98004,"I enjoyed Professor McKay's lectures overall, and felt that they were well-paced and structured. The problem sets had interesting questions, but the weekly schedule felt like a grind towards the end of the semester. The two exams were both really long as well--3 hours each for a midterm and final felt like a lot! I did feel like they were fair overall though. Office hour staff was good overall, and they were critical to completing the assignments each week. Content-wise, I thought that we covered a good amount, although the class felt a little slow in the first few weeks. Considering that this was Professor McKay's first time teaching the course, I thought that the class was a success, especially in terms of organization."
98004,"So much homework... McKay is a great prof but he does not give a hoot about student's lives outside of Algorithms -- either that, or he expects way too much from his students in assigning weekly homeworks that take anywhere from 15-40 hours per week."
98004,The lectures were good. the psets were challenging at times but there were lots of office hours to ask for help. The TAs are amazing.
98004,"Strengths: This course covers all the fundamental topics in algorithms and provides a great foundation for further study in theoretical computer science. This course also had plenty of support for students, with lots of office hours and review sessions.  Weaknesses: None, honestly. There's really nothing more you can expect from a class. Keep up the great work!"
98004,Strengths: Prof. McKay is a super good professor who really cares for his students and is great at lecturing; Weaknesses: none come to mind
98004,"I would spend more time typing up my problem sets that I would trying to solve them. If there was a way to make the homework of this class a bit less tedious, I think the students would really appreciate it. Perhaps making them bi-weekly assignments instead of weekly ones would be good (I heard they've done this in previous semesters)."
98004,The course is very well designed. The only thing that I wish was explained better was how to write effective proofs. The actual explanations of the algorithms themselves were fantastic.
98004,The homework assignments are great at reinforcing content from lectures. Office hours are very helpful for assistance with the course material.
98004,"- This class needs to focus more on algorithms that are tested on interviews: more breadth and less depth. Even though it is a required class for CS majors, I feel like the content was more similar to an elective. - Prof only engages with the top 10% of students that immediately understand what he's referring to. The lectures were like watching a black and white movie on 0.5x speed."
98004,Strengths include how applicable the material in the class is. It would be useful for job interview prep along with just building your own projects in the most optimal way possible.
98004,Content was clear and exams were straightforward
98004,"Strengths: We covered a wide range of algorithms and strategies. There was also in general a ton of support in the class, with a lot of peer tutor office hours and ed board engagement. Lecture was enjoyable and Professor McKay was funny and supportive.  Weaknesses: I wish we had spent more time on the material that we covered in the second half of the semester, especially on greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and P vs. NP problems. I found this material significantly more challenging than what we talked about in the first half, and I think I would have benefitted from going a bit faster on the easier topics and having more practice on the harder ones. I also wish that peer tutors had not given the answers on pset problems in office hours. Sometimes I went in with the hope of asking a pretty specific question, only to find that the peer tutor was walking through the entire pset. It was nice to have such a wide variety of times to attend office hours, but I think having 3-4 peer tutors at any given office hour is preferable to having a few different sessions led by only 1 peer tutor."
98004,Strengths: well structured problem sets
98004,"The homework was graded extremely easily; as a result, the class was actually curved down, which was frustrating."
98004,"Strengths: Prof McKay was a good lecturer and the course is structured so that getting help is very accessible because the course was super well-staffed. We also got 6 sheets (12 pages front and back) of notes for exams, which was honestly great; Weaknesses: I think the super busy queue-based office hours can be kind of overwhelming, but they could cater to people who want to work in groups at ohs"
98004,"Strengths: Dylan, the ed discussion, lectures, I liked the way homework questions were worded  Weaknesses: grading was a bit all over the place (sometimes it took a very long time to get grades back) and homework grades were VERY high which led to a high cutoff at the end of the course. I wish we would have spent a little longer on proving correctness for some algorithm types. We would briefly touch on it in class but sometimes I would have to look up how to prove correctness for certain types of algorithms. I think maybe just one in-depth proof per type of algorithm would have helped."
98004,Strength: covers important algorithms Weakness: a bit slow paced at times and grading was inconsistent
98004,Strengths: The professor was amazing!!!!! Definitely take this with Prof. McKay if you can! The homeworks were insightful and the exams were fair assessments of the class topics. There was a lot of help available through office hours and the ULAs were very open to questions. Weaknesses: The exam practice problems were significantly harder than the exams and problems we had seen on the homework so it was a little bit scary.
98004,"Professor McKay agreed but we couldve focused a bit less on data structures and more on algos!  If he teaches again, Im sure he will adjust the curriculum. Teaching and resources available were phenomenal!"
98004,"This course was relatively well-organized and the course staff was very supportive. Some strengths include the clarity of lectures and lecture notes, frequency of office hours, and supportive course staff. One area for improvement is providing more organized extra practice and making the notes from all optional discussion sections available for students who could not attend."
98004,Great lectures and content and very helpful OHs
98004,"Strengths: Professor McKay is a very good professor, interesting topics and problem sets Weaknesses: Lack of clarity in expectations for proofs in problem sets"
98004,"Well structured, interesting content"
98004,"The course is very well taught and easy to follow. The organization was also very good. The exams can be hard and can screw you over if you get stuck. This year's class also seems to be particularly strong since the assignments and exams are not easy but most people still got high grades, so people who are less familiar with proofs and have less prior experience with algorithms can struggle with grades since the curve is against them."
98004,The tests were pretty difficult thats all
98004,Could be improved by touching base on more interesting algorithms
98004,"Strengths: grading is very fair and the HWs don't require crazy amounts of investment.  Weaknesses: In some respects, I think the course might not have gone in-depth enough on some of these topics. I personally probably would not feel comfortable doing a CS interview after having taken this course, just because I think the level of mastery necessary to perform well on HW/tests is not that high. Also, there was some disorganization in the early parts of the semester, especially when it came to the first midterm (a question was created incorrectly, and the bonus was unsolvable)."
98004,"The format of the course was great and the late policy was generous. There was great organization in terms of office hours and extra help, which was really, really helpful for understanding of the topics. A weakness of the course is that the lectures can be very boring (and slow if not watching virtually and speeding them up) as the lecture formatting was pretty bland and mundane."
98004,"Content wise, this course covers a lot of fundamental algorithms, and teaches the ideas behind them.  Weaknesses: The course is intended to be rigorous, but on the psets, the graders often deduct points if your solution is not exactly the same as the intended solution. It feels like in general, grading is not based on correctness/rigor, but rather following a rubric based on the staff solution. This shifts the focus of the course away from coming up with creative and correct algorithms, but rather on writing the proof exactly how the graders want to see it."
98004,"McKay is probably one of the least engaging professors within the CS department here, which is really saying something. It really shows in his lack of preparation and the frequent confusion and errors within the problem sets, not even mentioning an exam question that was quite literally impossible to do with his given parameters."
98004,"Dylan is a great professor, and he goes over concepts at the right pace. His lectures are engaging, and the recordings/PPT slides helped review the material as well.   Perhaps due to the sheer size of the class, the course logistics sometimes felt a little disorganized. For instance, we would get incompletely written problem sets. Some grading on the exams also felt a little arbitrary (bonus questions)."
98004,"Lectures were fantastic. Dylan is an amazing lecturer and does a wonderful job building up hard topics over the course of a lecture. There were also a ton of helpful resources and really good slides. Problem sets were sometimes a bit tedious, but overall reflected what we were expected to know."
98005,Terrible class. Lectures bad. Learned nothing. PSETs terrible. Midterm practice exam's answer keys have many errors.
98005,"The weekly homeworks are a huge problem with this course. They take a tremendous amount of time to figure out and are way more demanding than whats taught weekly in class. On top of that, feedback takes forever to get since grading goes so slowly, so you spend most of the semester not really knowing what your total grade is. Fundamentally the content of the course is also not interesting but that cant be fixed."
98005,"Strengths: Professor McKay is a really nice and fun professor, and I learned a wide range of concepts and got the chance to apply all of them. The midterms were fair and not too hard, and the psets helped me practice the content we learned in class, even though they were very writing-intensive at times. Even though I didn't go to any, it was also nice to have optional discussion sections at a lot of different times. Weaknesses: The pacing could be faster, especially because there was material that the professor would like to spend more time on at the end of the semester but wasn't able to. The grading was also done in a rush, so it was wildly inconsistent between different people, and prevented us from getting much useful feedback in a timely manner. However, I'm not sure how this could be improved in a course of 300 people, where everyone is writing long proofs and the graders only have so much time to devote to the class."
98005,Professor McKay is awesome. He's a great lecturer and adds a sense of humor in his lectures that makes students laugh
98005,"Oh, Dylan McKay, a name that rings In halls of Yale where knowledge springs A CS teacher, with heart and mind Whose words on algorithms so refined  His lectures were a thing of grace A treasure trove of knowledge to embrace He spoke with clarity and ease And made the hardest concepts a breeze  With a voice so gentle and so kind He'd unlock mysteries of the mind And his passion for algorithms shone Like a ray of light in a lecture hall  He'd guide his students, one and all Through complexities, big and small With patience, he'd explain with care And offer guidance to those in despair  Dylan McKay, a teacher true A beacon of hope, a shining hue Whose legacy will forever stand As an inspiration in this land  Thank you, Dylan, for all you've done For shining a light, for making us one Your lessons we'll cherish, your memory we'll keep Forever in our hearts, forever deep."
98005,"Loved the psets, the rights level of challenging but not too hard."
98005,The assignments are challenging but helpful for thinking about the material; there is a lot of assistance available for those who need it. The professor walks through problems in class very clearly and is great at communicating the concepts. The course has few weaknesses.
98005,Prof. McKay is great. Office hours and discussion sections were good and very helpful. Course was a bit disorganised though with getting problem sets out and with grading in a timely matter.
98005,"Strengths: I liked the pace of lecture - I felt like it was just fast enough that I couldn't zone out (or else I would be lost), but just slow enough that I had time to jot everything down and think about it for a second before we moved on to the next topic. Also, the pset problems were pretty entertaining (they had elaborate backstories as to why the character in the problem needed to achieve the specific task that you had to solve), which I appreciated. Also strength: Xifan's office hours!! Weakness (kinda): Dylan was always trying to get us to go to section but.. I really did not understand what going to section was for and I never went."
98005,good course
98005,Dylan McKay is a good instructor and the course was well organized plus the grading was mega generous
98005,"Professor McKay is a huge strength! He took on a huge task this semester given the 300 students enrolled. But he rose to the challenge and created a very enjoyable course. He also had the help of a huge staff of TFs and ULAs who could offer help at practically every hour of the day. Although the content was challenging at times, the support from course staff ensured everyone would realize success."
98005,"The class is extremely well taught. Lectures are very easy to digest, and since they are recorded, it is also easy to go back and review anything that may be confusing. Prof. McKay also set up several resources for students who were falling behind on certain topics, with MANY office hours options, discussion sections, and peer tutoring. The class sets every student up for success, it is up to the students to decide whether they want to engage with material or not.   I personally cannot identify any weaknesses of the class, the lecture was very engaging and the course staff was very helpful."
98005,"Strengths: Content is very, very cool. The proofs are fun and satisfying to complete. Weaknesses: Lecture is dull. Professor talks too slowly, but then rushes through the hard parts of the proof. The book is far more effective in my opinion, and perhaps this is reflected in the fact that no one went to lecture. He should post the full syllabus of what he's going to cover. He started to do this at the beginning of the year and then got lazy with it as time progressed. Makes it harder to come prepared for class."
98005,"I would say that the lectures were well organized but did not explain *how* to do the problems, Prof McKay would just go through examples of them. Unfortunately, this left me pretty lost most of the semester in terms of starting problems.   Also, several hours of office hours are basically required. Im sure there were people, but I dont know anyone who was able to do the PSETs without office hours. While office hours are a very good resource, a minimum of several hours to do decent on the PSETs is too much. The course also tried to incorporate 2x a week discussion sections. These were optional but the professor did make it seem like you would need them to do really wellwhich just isnt practical."
98005,"I personally really enjoyed the content, but the course could be paced quicker."
98005,Class is way too easy. I feel like we could've learned so much more in the same amount of time. Lectures were good though. I wish problem sets were longer and more difficult.
98005,"Strengths: office hours (frequency, quality); Weaknesses: Some of Professor McKay's lectures felt a bit rushed."
98005,"The material was well taught. The professor was excellent. However, the organization of the class needs work. The first exam was written without much proofreading, causing much confusion after the fact. Grading is very arbitrary. Undergraduates should not be allowed to be involved in grading. Only PhD students should grade."
98005,"Strengths: The topics are very relevant, teaching is clear, only 2 midterms and 10 psets. Weaknesses: Some homeworks are much harder than others, even though all are weighted equally."
98005,"Strength: well structured, great lectures, great teaching staff (probably the best CS class Ive ever taken as a CA major)  Weakness: none!"
98005,Strength: a lot of OHs
98005,"One of the best CS classes at Yale. Good examples, intuitive understanding. Very strong TF team."
98005,"The lectures were great. The abundant textbooks felt like very helpful resources, even just knowing they were there if needed. The grading and the office hours and sections felt a little ad hoc."
98005,"The course is one of the best taught courses I've taken in computer science, but the exams were frustrating since many of the decisions for them were made last minute (resulting in one exam having an incorrect question), and since grade distributions for the exams were never released."
98005,"If you have prior competitive coding experience, this class wont feel that challenging. The psets are a good level of difficulty but it often felt tedious writing out the entire proofs rigorously. If algorithms are new to you, the powerpoints and content are taught rather well so you will get a good amount out of this class,"
98005,"Strengths: I think having the content follow the Algorithms Illuminated textbook was helpful. Prof. McKay's lectures were different enough that it didn't feel like he was copying the contents of the textbook, but similar enough that if you wanted a second source to support the lecture content, it was there. Many students complain that Yale's Algorithms class is theoretical instead of implementation based/practical. In my opinion, the problem sets were difficult but really interesting and helped me understand a lot of the content in a much deeper way than I would have if I were simply implementing algorithms. Coming away from this class, I feel very comfortable with the content that implementation, esp for recruiting, comes a lot more naturally and intuitively. Additionally, Prof. McKay is a very reasonable and fair professor when it comes to issues outside of lectures. He was happy to work with students, check in on the difficulty of the problem sets, etc and seemed to genuinely care about how he was teaching the course.   Weaknesses: This was Prof. McKay's first semester teaching Algorithms at Yale. The lectures felt very disorganized, especially as the semester went on. There were a few lectures that were supposed to cover very important topics, but it seemed like he had not adequately prepared the lectures or thought through how he was going to teach them. By the end of the semester, I was reading textbooks instead of going to the lecture because it became very hard to follow. Second, I think the schedule of the midterms was a terrible system. Midterms were taken in the evenings on weeknights. However, Prof. McKay would test on topics he taught EARLIER IN THE DAY of the midterms on top of new topics that were presented that week. The course should be better organized and timed such that we have ample time to learn and study the midterm content, instead of trying to learn things in the hours between the lecture and midterm. Lastly, the course organization itself could have been better. This is a trivial issue but was just a small annoying part that spoke to larger organizational issues of the class. The canvas pages with syllabus, readings, topics, etc was not regularly updated and they simply just stopped updating it halfway through the course. It was hard to keep track of what we did and did not cover or were expected to know because the lecture schedules got moved around or changed as the course went on."
98005,"This course was really well structured, had fair exams and homeworks, and they really covered the knowledge in the course well! That being said, the course could have covered a lot more, or gone further in depth with a few concepts; lectures kind of tended to drag on for a while about one concept. Besides that, though, everything was great!"
98005,Courses were overall good! I have no suggestions!
98005,This course was all around a very good course. Professor Mckay was one of the best computer science professors Ive had. There was also a lot of support and helped given in this course. The homeworks were also very well written and really stretched my brain to the max.
98005,"The course was very well taught and organized, however the only thing is that sometimes there were errors in the midterms or psets that made the problem far harder (nearly impossible) than intended."
98005,"The class is very well-organized and well-taught in that every concept is explained to the very details and lots of examples are given for students to understand the materials. The homework problems are also good practices. There are also a myriad of ULA/TA resources (dozens of sessions each week), so students need can be readily fulfilled. The exams are very closely related with class materials and are definitely manageable if one has understood everything covered in class."
98005,"Algorithms is a super interesting course. I wish we spent more time on being able to solve harder problems. We would get previews but never were expected to really excel on psets and push ourselves too much. I was able to do all of them without office hours, which sometimes cost me a couple points on proofs, but was a shame because I missed out on the benefits of harder psets and oh. Professor is a good lecturer and cares about the course. Very knowledgeable and engaging. Exams are always a mixed bag. Tbh the true false unsure questions are awful. Generally exam questions are fun and not too crazy although the final had a dp problem with 4 base cases, which was more than we had seen but not too hard. The true false unsure questions are the worst part of the course by far because its a mind game to try and balance your score and decide if you want to be conservative or shoot higher, which would work if grade cutoffs were announced before exams, but they werent. An A was a 95 or above which is just something to be aware of. Overall a required course and a good one that challenges the way you think. Small issues with inconsistency in grading and communication, but still worth it by far."
98005,"strengths: ta support, weaknesses: especially with the harder topics (dynamic programming) I found dylan's lectures to be boring"
98005,The course was very well organized. There were a lot of resources to provide support if needed. The professor was very engaging and truly cared about the intellectual development and well being of his students.
98005,"Strengths: - Great TAs + course manager - Dr. Mckay's lectures are clear and it is evident he cares a lot about teaching and the course.  - You learn a lot  Weaknesses: - Weekly problem sets that could take ~15-20 hours felt like a bit overkill. It was difficult to prepare for a midterm when you just had a huge problem set due the previous week. I've heard others talk about how in previous iterations there were ~6 problem sets, with one being a 202 recap. This class teaches you a lot but it is a constant grind from day one.  - Exams were hard, although they were graded pretty leniently.  - Almost an 'anti-curve' where you needed a 95 for an A."
98005,"Strengths: I thought Professor McKay's lectures were clear, and I liked the challenge and length of the problem sets.   Weaknesses: Professor McKay's lecture style involves asking a lot of questions of the class, and as lecture attendance dwindled, very few people ended up participating in the lecture, which could get awkward. I sometimes felt like lectures were a bit slow, and I wish the department would bring back the option of Advanced Algorithms (CPSC 366)."
98005,"Strengths: The ULAs! The constant office hours were very helpful and they helped me understand the content so much. The late policy was really generous and very helpful because the problems could be very difficult and/or if people had personal things or other work to attend to, it gave them some flexibility.  I think McKay is a great lecturer and genuinely cares about students and going to his office hours was also very, very helpful.  Weaknesses: This is probably not a weakness because it will help us in the long run but this class was tough! It was very demanding timewise and mental capacity wise."
98010,The projects were very interesting.
98010,Richard's lectures are definitely one of the best ones I have attended. My favorite class at Yale!
98010,"Great content, super practical education in building systems. Problem sets were great and felt very relevant to lecture content. However, the lecture pace was often too fast."
98010,"I really enjoyed this class. There was a lot of support which made tackling difficult content not overwhelming. You learn very applicable skills, but also a lot of theoretical background on how most systems work nowadays."
98010,"Strengths: the format of covering both breadth (mostly in lecture material) and depth (e.g. the Raft pset) worked extremely well for making the content feel accessible and relevant. Psets were long but focused on useful material, and grading was fair. Some approachable extra credit was offered. I liked having the chance to explore a topic in the course more in-depth through the final project. Weaknesses: Prof. Yang should slow down his lecturing speed. More proactive teaching staff support would be helpful (holding smaller, spaced out review sessions or more frequent check-ins). For the project, I quickly found out it's really difficult to build anything in distributed systems in a month! I think more time or encouragement toward a smaller project scope is needed."
98010,"strengths: strong instructors support, informative lectures, interesting labs, a lot of office hours, helpful study guide weaknesses: this course doesn't provide recordings by default, so you need to attend lectures in person, or you will spend more time on the materials to prepare the midterm"
98010,"Strengths: psets were very fun and challenging, staff were all quite receptive and helpful, weaknesses: the lectures could be a bore, and Yang went through too much content in too little time."
98010,"The lectures were well-prepared and motivated, and the problem sets were engaging and interesting. While it's hard for distributed systems, I think some smaller more tangible examples and applications of things would have been useful for some concepts."
98010,"It's very interesting, but pretty hard at times. I think it goes over materials faster than I could follow."
98010,"Lecture content is always really interesting and relevant, and we get guest lecturers from very accomplished members of the field. The pacing of the class is quite fast, but if you're willing to put in the work it's very rewarding."
98010,"Strengths: The material is so useful to learn and the teaching staff puts a lot of thought into the design of the course. The PSETs are interesting and the midterm is fair. Weaknesses: although Professor Yang is receptive to feedback about this, the lectures go by very quickly and are hard to follow at times."
98010,"The course has an incredible professor, Richard, and Xiao who's long graduated acts as a fantastic TA/instructor due to his commitment to the class and experience at Meta. The course goes through material very quickly and the labs come fast, but you learn a lot. The labs were a huge amount of work but I really enjoyed them. The grading at the same time was fairly nice though the presentation of our results could use some work (being an inscrutable csv row)."
98010,"Strengths: the content felt very useful, and the labs were well-designed and really helpful for learning; the guest lectures were amazing Weaknesses: the lectures weren't always well-organized"
98010,"Strengths: the problem sets, guest speakers of significance in the distributed systems world, writing in Go; Weaknesses: hard to learn from lectures since they go too fast and slides aren't clear"
98010,Strengths: professor yang was very knowledgeable and xiao was also very helpful in offering his knowledge from industry
98010,"strengths: really good psets, excellent help from Xiao/Prof Yang/ULAs, exam covers a ton of content but is fair, lots of opportunities to earn extra credit and be rewarded for working hard, insightful guest speakers weaknesses: lectures cover a lot of content & psets are barely spaced out. most of them are not terribly difficult, but they are often released one week after the other, so you only effectively have a week to do some of the easier psets"
98010,Raft pset is simply too difficult. I spent over 100 hours on it and still failed the pset. Another weakness is that the professor can be hard to follow in class often.
98011,"Strengths: open-ended midterm and final projects, Prof Petersen wants you to learn. Weaknesses: very very hard to stay engaged in lecture, didn't really understand any of the material in-depth, TA (Tong Cheng) was super unhelpful at office hours. Also there were assigned readings but it was pretty clear that no one was doing them. Also #2 SuperCollider made me want to tear my hair out because the documentation is SO obtuse."
98011,"Scott provided a lot of materials and example files for each class. We covered a lot of topics. The assessments, however, were very specific to a single topic covered in class. While this allowed us to dive deep into specific areas, a large amount of the lectures were never revisited in assessments or projects."
98011,I love the interactive aspect of the course. Every lecture included practical examples that we could use in our own projects. The course was a good mix of theory and practice.
98011,"The course material is very interesting, but sometimes it is confusing in lecture."
98011,Strengths: open-ended assignments. Easy grading. Weaknesses: very disorganized class. Classes were random topics (did not follow the syllabus) and the professor talked about whatever he wanted without following any curriculum.
98011,"Strengths: organization of the class website, interesting lectures, and open-endedness of projects. Weaknesses: the learning curve for both using the program and applying concepts. The class moves quickly but it can take a while to grasp foundational concepts."
98011,"The lectures are a good mix of theory and hands-on coding practice/examples. The example SuperCollider documents are key, and are really interesting and helpful. The lecture slides/material itself was easy to sort of miss or not fully absorb, since we were never responsible for remembering it or showing mastery of that material on exams, etc. I did love how project-based and open-ended the course was; it allowed for a lot of creativity and fun creation of music. I think a big weakness was lack of feedback in a timely manner, and not much specific feedback in general."
98012,Great for developing a project to talk about in interviews; way too much time spent planning and not enough focus on the actual coding.
98012,"Lecture is a lot of slides and information that you arent necessarily tested on in any way, which is a weakness in terms of lecture being worth the time it takes. Working on a project, however, is a huge strength because its the closest thing you get to real world experience in a class at Yale for CS."
98012,"Lecture a bit boring, would love for him to teach a bit more of the hard skills as opposed to the high-level SWE topics."
98012,"Building a team project is very fun (is you like the people you're working with) and demoing your semester long work is also very fulfilling. Lecture is oftentimes dead since not many people go, think this could be improved with more active engagement ""labs"" during lecture time or something like that"
98012,Very good
98012,"The course is well taught and well structured. Professor Timos does everything in his power to ensure students a) learn what is necessary out of his lectures, b) have a balanced workload, and c) learn how to use new tech stacks."
98012,The lectures could be made more technical.
98012,Strength is grading entirely dependent on project. Weakness is high amount of writing for assignments (mostly filler content).
98012,The idea of the class is very good
98012,If we had more guidance for our semester long project it would be appreciated.
98012,"Strengths: lots of flexibility in the project that you choose, excellent professor.  Weaknesses: a lot of variety in individuals' starting abilities, tutorials for getting various stacks set up are outdated."
98012,This course offers a lot of freedom to people participating and really embraces the team aspect of software engineering. You get to call the shots and this places a lot of responsibility on students but also encourages students to grow a lot. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale and Timos is a great instructor.
98012,Amazing course overall: - project-based learning - team collaboration fosters leadership skills - well-planned milestones and homework assignments
98012,"This course is very hands-on, and students have a lot of liberty regarding what their project looks like and how they go about the development process. While there is a lot of freedom to basically ""do what you want"", it does feel like the class is unstructured at times, and everyone rushes the few assignments that we do have last minute."
98012,"No midterm no final, group project throughout the whole semester"
98012,"strengths: lots of flexibility -- you get what you put into it, you have the chance to pursue your interests, the class is super chill and you don't have to attend every single class meeting, opportunities to present what you've created, Timos is super kind and a good lecturer, the guest lectures are very thoughtful and add to the overall learning experience, workload is fairly light weaknesses: not much support for learning a new tech stack, could be better if we had assigned meetings w/TAs"
98012,"I think there was too much emphasis on both in class material and the project from the instructor. I think I would focus on one or the other, but not both, or else everything becomes really complicated really quickly."
98012,strength: combine practice and theory
98012,"You need to get a good team if not you will need to do alot of the work yourself, some of the individual homework submissions are not realistic in software engineering at an industry level. Other than that, the course was good as you get to actually build a proper project."
98012,"Strengths- you get to work on your own project and you get what you put into it Weaknesses - little to no guidance, if your group sucks youre screwed"
98012,I feel like the homework assignments which were ~1500 word reports could be replaced with more emphasis on coding instead. The evaluations for other projects were important but a general sentiment I've heard is the word requirement is something that just encourages superficial feedback from other students reviewing your project.
98012,This course is very open-ended so students with lots of different interests can get something out of it. The projects covered a wide variety of industries and types. The lectures are not very engaging though.
98017,"I do like the way the professor engages the student with polls and interactions in class. I think his preparations for this course is thorough. On the other hand, there are times when he spend considerable amount of time in things that are rather straight-forward or materials that are already in the reading."
98017,Strength is that there are many guest speakers and we got the chance to have dinner with them
98017,The lectures had a lot of interesting content (especially with the guest lectures) and the homeworks posed intriguing questions as well but some of the lectures could have been a bit more engaging.
98017,The class had very engaging lectures and interesting lecture topics. I wish more students attended the class in person for more class engagement.
98017,The course was overall very good especially the guest speakers and the fact that we had the opportunity to eat with them.
98017,"I only came to appreciate this course in the very last stretch of the material. Had i been engaged earlier, it would have been a much better experience, especially since Prof. Slade is a deeply knowledgeable and hilarious lecturer and he very clearly cares about everything he presents in this course."
98017,"Strengths: Lots of guest speakers + opportunities to interact with people in industry.   Weaknesses: Unengaging, not particularly structured (partially because since there are so many days with guest speakers),"
98017,All good
98017,"The assignments are interesting and engaging, but incorporating more complex tasks may be helpful for students to understand course topics better."
98017,Strengths: probably the most interesting CS prof I've had Weakesses: felt there was some ambiguity in the pset specs
98017,"The lectures were always interesting and Professor Slade is a fun lecturer. The guest speakers that he brought in also gave introductions to a wide range of fields where lecture topics could be applied. One area for improvement in this course is with regards to the coding assignments. Although it was nice to have flexibility in what we could code, some guidance and more direct application of course material in the assignments would have been helpful."
98017,interesting
98017,Course materials and guest speakers are excellent. And there could be more instructions on homework.
98017,"The course really teaches the concept related to automated decisions. However, the course content is not that relevant to the assignments. The more serious question is the description of the assignment is very unclear and many of us misunderstood the assignment requirement and get a very low grade. But the grading of that misunderstood assignment is released after the final assignment's deadline. So even when I know I did not meet the requirement for the following assignment, I cannot change it. For graduate papers, there is the same issue."
98017,"I liked working on the homework questions. however, I think an exam might have been useful for the class. as well as concise notes."
98017,"I think the main strength of this course is the guest lectures - Slade is very well connected, and it certainly shows in the class. It's insane - we had Citadel high-ups, ex-editors of US News, and so much more, along with the ability to enter a lottery to have dinner with them. The homeworks were fun and they were very open ended, though I would have appreciated more structure and detail in the specification. Many students had issues because of this, though I would argue the spec was clear enough in the areas they had issues and the students simply lack decent English comprehension, or had not watched a single lecture the entire semester."
98017,The course brought in amazing speakers and gave a good overview of the various options for decision-making models. I also really liked that the assignments forced the student to come up with their own models with little guidance. I do wish that the assignments were better defined in terms of what the desired end result was.
98017,Engaging subject Matter; Wide range of applications; interesting guest lectures; fair grading a couple of the assignments may have been a little TOO open ended
98021,I learned a lot in the course about AI which is a useful topic.
98021,"The biggest weakness looking back on the whole semester is that most of the content is almost a decade old. Thats not an issue for the basics, but given that I took this in Spring 23, I feel like more conversation shouldve been about AI today and how quickly its developing and how it can be used."
98021,"It's hard to talk about the strengths of this course without pointing out all of the glaring weaknesses. All of the course material was taken from other universities. I understand that other institutions may have already built a robust AI course, but I feel cheated that the instructors didn't put any effort into crafting original material. Additionally, the instructors felt under-prepared to give the actual lectures; there were always long pauses and corrections of previous mistakes during lecture.   The lectures were somewhat related to the projects we were assigned, but had very little relation to the problem sets. This meant that students were left to self-learn material or seek additional office hours. Assignments were also published later than outlined, causing the push back of deadlines. There were always adjustments to the office hour schedule, which meant that students couldn't count on a routine for peer help."
98021,Great course
98021,"The main course assignments are divided into coding projects and written math-based problem sets. The coding projects are really fun and rewarding to complete. The problem sets, however, have unclear directions and can be extremely tedious at times. Some questions on the second problem set felt like cruel busy work. The teaching staff is not very helpful in assisting with the problem sets."
98021,"Strengths: projects are well-designed and a lot of fun; good amount of work (only psets and projects, which shouldn't take too much of your time); material is engaging Weaknesses: sometimes way too broad; students aren't very engaged"
98021,"quizzes aren't great, and I'd prefer more project-oriented assignments"
98021,"I think the professors are really enthusiastic about the materials and carries out the lectures and discussions with great passion. However, somehow I feel like the assignments and projects are considerably harder than the materials discussed in class. It would be more helpful if we go over more thorough examples that we would see in the problem sets, or just to make the problem sets less intensive."
98021,remove some repetitive works in the problem sets
98021,Strengths: instructors who really care about the material and engage the students; weaknesses: a lot of busy-work style psets that feel unnecessarily tedious and lengthy
98021,Great
98021,"It was very disorganized and the lectures were not very engaging. The professors seemed to not have a good sense of what they were doing this semester, which was very apparent in their ability to lectures and create reasonable problem sets."
98021,"Lectures were not always very clear and did not reflect what was asked of us on the homework very well. However, the office hours were always very helpful and the content was interesting."
98021,"There were very unenjoyable weekly quizzes, and the problem sets often required many iterations for a single part of a problem that felt unnecessarily long."
98021,"The class was good overall, but had some quirks. Some of the homework assignments relied on tedious computation, like manually doing backpropagation or dynamic programming. Lectures were also somewhat vague, so youd have to keep an eye on the Ed to do the assignments."
98021,"Strengths: chill grading scheme, doable psets and projects. Tesca is an engaging and helpful lecturer, despite the 9AM lecture time. Weaknesses: psets were extremely tedious in the beginning, but the staff were able to learn from feedback and rethink their psets."
98021,"The course is well-designed, meaning that each unit is clearly outlined and connects into one another. Starting from the basics into harder concepts that involve the combination of previous ideas. It could be hard to catch up if you are behind, but if you keep up with the learning then you'll have a lot of fun. The course also has no exam which is AMAZING! Though the weekly quizzes can get annoying and stressful, but they are generally pretty easy so just make sure to pay attention in class and take good notes. The homework is helpful in some way because you are implementing a bunch of helper functions on the core mechanisms following the pseudocodes presented in class, which can get satisfying when the visualization of the result runs smoothly. But doing little work meaning that you might not understand how something works 100% of the time, but some partial understanding. Also the practice problems of the homework are kinda boring because they are just boring computations by hand. It'd be much more interesting if they are just a few questions to test basic knowledge and leave the main part in coding. Though doing these problems do help you develop a better understanding on how the algorithms work."
98021,This was the most tedious course I have ever taken. It doesnt really teach you about AI and it definitely wastes your time and effort
98021,"The course covered many different topics, but I feel like it could have gone more in-depth. Homework was often tedious and arbitrary. I felt like a lot of the course was minutiae."
98021,"The format of this class really needs to be restructured. Towards the end, it felt like we were rushing through concepts way too quickly to meaningfully understand them. And the grad student presentations took up an entire week or more of class, and sure, some of them were interesting, but I really feel like the class wouldve benefited more from having more class time for the curriculum."
98021,"This course could be great but right now it is not. The co-teaching method didn't work. The problem sets adn slides were taken from a Berkeley course which made it feel impersonal. The lectures were pretty unengaging, i wish that office hours had been better run and that there had been more."
98021,problem sets were filled with many tedious calculations
98021,Good lectures
98021,"This course had significant weaknesses in the lecturing and problem sets. Lectures were generally error-filled, with many mistakes needing to be corrected in the middle of lecture or in an announcement after class. As a result, the material could become somewhat confusing at times without any prior knowledge as even the definition of the examples in class would change frequently. Problem sets were also tedious and more of a test of mental tenacity than one of understanding. Slides and projects were both taken from one of Berkeley's intro to AI courses, a fact that was frequently evident through the lack of definitive answers about the slide material."
98021,all good
98021,"The class was rather disorganized and the psets were unnecessarily tedious at times. Sometimes I couldn't even tell if what I was doing was correct, even after going to office hours. We were also given little help with understanding the context behind the project code base."
98021,The course was taught very well and clearly. There aren't any weaknesses that could be improved upon apart from mistakes made in some of the assignments when posted.
98021,"The biggest weakness of this class was the design of the problem sets. The problem sets made us take an algorithm designed to be run on a computer and do all the calculation by hand, which I think is a good way to help us to understand the material. The problem is that these algorithms are usually very repetitive, and at some point repeating the same procedure over and over ceases to be instructive and starts to feel like busywork. Some of the problem sets made us continue repeating similar calculations long past the point that it was instructive, and I think those questions could have been made considerably shorter without changing how much I learned.  I generally liked the programming projects, but I think they could have been longer and more involved, to help us engage with the material more deeply.   I think it would have been nice to have some sort of cumulative final project or final exam. I find that if I only have to know material for a few weeks (to do a problem set and a programming assignment), I sometimes forget it afterwards, especially in a class like this one, where not everything builds on the previous material. The process of refreshing myself on the material for a final project or exam really helps me commit it to long-term memory.  I thought the idea of random Canvas quizzes during class was very reasonable."
98021,The coding assignments are well-organized and intriguing. More instructions and examples relating to the written assignments would be very helpful for completing them.
98021,Strengths: good range of topics to provide a base understanding of AI and no exams. Weaknesses: problem sets often got tedious and were graded a lot on accuracy of calculations rather than conceptual understanding of the materials.
98021,teach clearly and the problem set helps. but some questions in the ps are too tedious
98021,strengths: cover a lot of important topics in AI weakness: sometimes the class materials are not explained clearly causing the confusions in doing problem sets
98021,"Strengths: There are no exams, which allows students to focus more on learning through the PSETs and de-emphasizes rote memorization of equations. The office hours were abundant and the ULAs / TAs were very high-quality.  Weaknesses: Since the class had new professors this year, there was some lack of organization which I believe will improve in future semesters. The in-class quizzes were often too difficult and gave us very little time to apply what we had just learned in the last class. The 9am course time was a bit inconvenient, as was the lecture location in the Humanities Quadrangle."
98021,Strengths: Strong support system among professors/TAs/ULAs  Weaknesses: Problems often way too tedious and grading often did not reflect how much we actually understood the material
98021,"Strengths: PSETS are very interesting, and teach the students how to mathematically think about the inner workings of the algorithms Weaknesses: the PSETS were very grindy, and I cannot name one I enjoyed working on"
98021,i think it was a good course overall. some of the home works were hard and not enough content was covered in the course to cover all of the homework
98021,"I think the structure of the course was great. I loved the biweekly PSET/Project format without exams, and I especially liked how the projects were always engaging applications of the material. It was nice for the material to build from week to week, and it made seeing how the methods we learned about exist in every day applications that we use. For improvement, however, some of the PSETS were quite tedious and required a lot of repetitive calculations, so we all ended up worrying more about whether the dozens of little calculations we were doing were correct rather than thinking about the big picture material."
98021,I would like the instructor to break the projects down into smaller tasks. Besides the extra credit part of the project is hard and I wish there could be more hint.
98021,"The PSets were sometimes needlessly tedious. They would make us calculate hundreds and hundreds of probabilities by hand, which felt unnecessary to gain an understanding of the material. Also as a 9am class, the in-class quizzes were quite tough."
98021,Unclear instructions on problem sets could be ironed out earlier.
98021,"The content of the course is very interesting and overall well taught. However, the homeworks were poorly designed, as they often doing full algorithms by hand, which was very tedious and not very helpful for learning."
98021,"Strengths: good variety of problems to solve through the problem sets and projects, the project portion of the course gives cool applications of AI concepts  Weaknesses: Problem sets especially seemed very pedantic at times, lecture content would provide relatively straightforward examples that ended up being much more complicated on assignments, which caused quite a bit of frustration"
98021,"In my opinion, the course should be less dependent on quizzes that lock after 15 minutes for the sake of accessibility, and instead aim towards having tests."
98021,"The pseudocode for the backpropogation algorithm, taken from the textbook, was the most helpful way of learning backpropogation for me, but I spent a significant amount of time attempting to decipher its too-terse notation rather than trying to understand the concepts of backpropogation. In particular, attempting to infer whether specific variables where, ie, 2D or 3D.  Psets are due before projects. However, you are able to automatically see the grade for your project & resubmit it, which is not an option for psets. The result is that, a couple times, I did the project first to help concretely grasp the concepts covered in class before doing the higher stakes pset. I felt this was worthwhile despite the issues imposed by going against the order suggested by the due dates.  (although, on one occasion I misunderstood a concept in a way that didn't matter for the project but did for a pset, leading to a poor grade on that pset)  I think the quizzes are a decent way of making sure everyone is reasonably up to date on the material, and dropping a few of them is a good way of ensuring they aren't too punitive."
98023,The exam is too hard It focus too much on linguistic part.
98023,good
98023,Overall nice. The assignment can be better designed
98023,"Strengths: got a pretty in-depth introduction to NLP and learned about the state of the field almost up to present day. Also a strength - Drago :( Afterwards, the CS DUS came in to talk to us about how they were going to proceed with the course etc and I appreciated that he did so and the way that he explained the changes. Also appreciated Arman coming in halfway through the course and picking up the content that was left. Weaknesses: kinda hard to pay attention in class/the slides did not feel like they were setting us up for success. I would have appreciated having the slides posted before class to follow along during lecture, and also having a clearer roadmap of why we were talking about certain topics and how different slides related to each other. Sometimes it felt like we totally just jumped from one topic to another."
98023,"The strengths of this course include the introduction of many concepts related to NLP. The weakness of this course is that there isn't much technical coding content in the lectures, while the assignments were mainly based on high-level coding."
98023,"The course material is, for the most part, very interesting. The course spends a lot of time on models that are not used very often anymore, but that's sort of an unavoidable issue with such a rapidly evolving field - it's also still very enlightening to learn a bit about models like BERT. There were plenty of organizational foibles - grades take a very long time, for instance - but that is more than forgivable considering the timing of Drago's unfortunate passing."
98023,"The strength of this course is how it started with easy-to-understand concepts and later dived deeper. Extra adapting time was required as the first and second half of this course have drastically different styles of how the materials are delivered but I understand it was inevitable. It would be helpful if, for each coding assignment, there can be a session that provides general guidance instead of just the office hours where each student asks respective questions."
98023,"Pretty well designed course other than the final, which was chaotic to prepare for given that we were kept completely in the dark about what we should expect on it. The least they could have done was give us a review session but they explicitly refused to do that saying they ""didn't think it was necessary"" even when they simultaneously admitted the exam was completely new and they couldn't provide previous tests to prepare based on."
98023,So far so good.
98023,The course was well structured and I feel using exams was appropriate in this context given that implementing or using LLMs is not that feasible in a classroom setting.
98023,would be better if practice exams can be provided
98023,It is good
98023,Students may benefit from more hands on application of NLP models.
98023,"The course is mainly taught via powerpoints, but I enjoyed the format because it provides a really nice visual way to grasp different architectures and representations of concepts like Word2Vec. The PSETs (espec coding ones) were on the challenging side, but the lectures did a good job introducing what concepts would be important for them. Class discussions occurred through a website called piazza but the the TAs were really helpful and came in clutch with quick response times!! Overall, the structure was really good given the unfortunate hurdles thrown at NLP this year (change of professor mid way through)."
98023,Great lectures and content. Very interesting projects and assignments
98023,"strength: very comprehensive content  weakness: the coding assignments are very hard and zoo is too unstable to use. The content isn't very organized with a smooth flow, the professor (Radev) skips slides very often and went back and forth"
98023,The content is good but wished there was more practical hands on coding assignments
98023,strengthintroductory knowledge is provided
98023,"I think Arman focusing on the architecture of recent LLMs was a little bit less useful than if he also incorporated working with some architectures that are the backbone of all of these, helping students gain intuition about the main ideas behind this."
98023,The topics covered after midterm were too difficult.
98023,The course was really helpful for us to understand NLP concepts.
98023,Strengths: detailed walk-through of basic concepts weaknesses: too quick the pace during the second half
98023,"classes are a bit unorganized, slides are skipped back and forth"
98027,"Strength: slides were usually engaging, liked the multimedia content. Weakness: boring at times, and we spent so much time planning the final project that we barely had any time to actually code it."
98027,Great overview of HCI concepts but the assignments were drawn out and instruction in the technologies we needed to use was lacking (but tfs were very helpful).
98027,"No weaknesses except the midterm maybe (since it was hella memorization), but it is a So credit so it's worth it strengths marynel is a very good lecturer, very engaging content, engaging lectures, final project was fun"
98027,"Strengths:  - The initial assignments are very straightforward and easy to appraoch.  Weaknesses: - We are only given two weeks to implement our final projects, and we are not given proper training or instruction for implementing these. Students are forced to figure out the implementation by themselves in a very short (and extremely stressful) time frame. - All the assignments prior to the final project emphasize concepts that are too elementary (i.e. how to brainstorm)"
98027,"Strengths: Good lectures, different kind of content you wouldn't see in CS, easy Social Science credit for CS people; Weaknesses: Very backloaded work. We had 2+ weeks per the first 5 (out of 7) assignments which were all pieces of cake, and only 1 week for the entire implementation of the semester-long project. My group stayed up past 2AM on many days in that week. Took away an entire week of my life just because the deadlines of assignments made no sense"
98027,"Strengths: the actual content in the course is solid and interesting. It's generally presented in an accessible manner. Weaknesses: the whole interactive display thing with the Kinect is just plainly not fun to work with (for me and others I have spoken to). Simply put, the technology and experience of working with it is ""janky"". It would be nice to have even one other alternative to the kind of project that can be done to gain firsthand experience with the iterative design cycle. Additionally, the amount of time given to actually implement the prototype was too short. My group made (in my opinion) good use of A5 and A6, but we weren't satisfied with the time we had nor the final result. Aditionally, ""experienced"" students have to take on way more responsibility than is reasonable. In terms of content, I also found that some things were excessively over-explained despite being simple and intuitive to pretty much everyone (like the contextual inquiry, master-apprentice interaction) while things that were actually confusing were briefly mentioned and never explained again (like tasks, my god, questions about tasks came up again and again all the way into A6)."
98027,"I think it would be better to assign groups based on times students could meet. You work with the same assigned group on a project all semester and my group struggled to find times to meet sometimes. I think that when assigning groups that have to meet outside of class, the professor should have thought about that a little more, rather than just matching skill sets. I liked the interactive portions of this course and the guest speakers were pretty cool."
98027,"The content of the lectures was very interesting. I learnt a lot about design principles and examples in real life.  This class is very fast paced because there are many assignments and most have a large group work component, with no late days."
98027,"Class is great, i thoroughly enjoyed it"
98027,"The first 5 assignments didn't prepare me for the last 2. We should start coding after assignment 4 or 3. The workload ramped up so much in the end. Also, the first assignments don't consider the limitations of the technology we are using. We are only supposed to look at that after we considered the problem space which I find led to my team backtracking on our implementations."
98027,"Strengths: The final project is fun to work on with a good group, and the course does not have a demanding workload. There is only one exam (midterm) and it is fairly intuitive and easy to get a good grade on, even if you haven't attended all of the lectures. Weaknesses: You start programming the final project only during the final three weeks of the semester, which can be stressful if your group is unresponsive or if you do not have a lot of experience with javascript. Lectures can be a bit dry sometimes, especially in the beginning of the semester. Also, prof does not teach you programming techniques or try to give students a greater understanding of the sensor used in the final project."
98027,"The strengths of the class were definitely the lectures. Interesting and compelling with awesome content. However, the weakness is definitely the final project. It didn't feel like much of a CS class. The only coding we did was for the class-long final project, and it was worth almost nothing even within this project. I would have wished we did more mini projects that helped to more regularly showcase what we'd learned."
98027,Enable working with friends we know for the project
98027,"Being randomly assigned a group is really hit or miss, but I felt pretty unlucky with my group, so it made the whole class frustrating. All of the assignments are highly dependent on how motivated each of your group members are. Even though nothing was particularly difficult, it became a burden to coordinate timing with the rest of the group and pester other members to finish their work."
98027,"Was very interesting content-wise and had a very reasonable amount of work and engagement for most of the semester. However, the work did become very heavy towards the end with the project and the random groups are a big issue."
98027,This class is really well organized. The lectures are clear and the assignments are well structured. I am not sure if there needs to be any of improving to be honest. I enjoyed the class and think every single CS major should take this. It makes you actively think about your implementation when coding thereby making you a better software engineer.
98027,"Strengths: Well taught, a lot of resources and explanations   Weaknesses:"
98027,"Sometimes, the content in the lectures felt intuitive and unnecessary; I would have preferred to focus on content that was more technical and applicable to coding the semester project."
98027,"Strengths: one of the most well-organized courses I've ever taken. The expectations were made extremely clear from the first day of what was expected in the course, and there was a lot of student support throughout. The material, itself, is also very interesting.  Weaknesses: The lectures were a bit slow at times. While it was cool to work on one project throughout the entire semester, I wish we had more time to work on the actual implementation."
98027,"None, the class was great!"
98027,The course project was great until the end. We were not given great guidance on how to write the code to interpret the body movements on camera and we were given very little time to write the code relative to the length of the semester.
98027,Well-paced and well-structured group project. Interesting guest speakers.
98027,"Strengths: the content, course calendar, Ed stem system and low stress level Weaknesses: the pacing of the class. I wish we had more time to work on our final installation. It was like a mad rush working on our program and studying for finals/other projects in the last two weeks of May."
98027,This course was all-around a very would course. I had an amazing experience and would recommend it to any computer science/cognitive science student. The course faculty was amazing and the assignments were well designed.
98027,The bulk of the course load was all in the last two weeks. It was hard to manage.
98027,"Strengths: Prof Vzquez is a great instructor and leader of the course. The organization of the lectures was also a high point, ie the order in which material was presented made a lot of sense. The TAs were also great when it came to developing the final project. The midterm exam was very fair.   Weaknesses: N/A. This course is exactly as it should be."
98027,The quality of Professor Vazquezs teachings.
98027,Course was not engaging for most of the semester. I only felt like I learned things in the last few weeks when working on the actual project.
98027,"Strengths: very engaging and interesting course. Weakness: only 2 weeks to code the whole project, should be more time"
98027,"For the most part, I felt that I came to class every day just to have the same core concept reemphasized to me: that if you want to design a system that's good for users, then you should talk to the users and find out what kind of design they want. Most of what was taught could be boiled down to that. As a consequence, lectures were hard to engage with and the course work was largely uninteresting. The in-class assignments felt far more like attendance quizzes than something necessary for the class, and as a consequence, makes any of the concepts learned/reinforced from them feel more like a chore than an interesting concept/idea to keep in mind. The biggest weakness of the class was the semester long project, which is unfortunately because it plays a large roll in the class. The first 80% of the assignments for the project felt extremely inconsequential and my group was able to meet the night before they were due and slap them together and get a solid grade on them. Assignments 5 and 6 felt like an extreme jump from the previous assignments, as we went from prototyping on paper and digitally to just immediately programming the entire system. Additionally, none of the necessarily languages were really taught in lecture, and so for someone with little experience in CSS and no experience in HTML/JavaScript, I felt like dead weight having to either spend my time doing non-programming tasks or make up for my deficiency by scrambling to learn these languages. I understand that the groups were meant to be optimized to have people who understand these languages in each group, but some elementary teaching of these languages in this class could really help the distribution of labor in the final assignments, as well as assigning the actual programming assignments earlier so students have more time to learn (especially if the languages aren't taught) and less pressure. Also, a lot of the HCI concepts required for the assignments (such as 'tasks') felt extremely ill-defined, and everyone in my groups and other groups I spoke to felt confused on what some of the assignments were truly asking of us, even after reviewing notes/lecture slides. Almost every other student I spoke with felt similarly disinterested/uninspired by the first few assignments and then extremely overwhelmed by the last assignments. Ultimately, I had been interested in the idea of Human Computer Interaction, and thought that the first few lectures were interesting regarding learning the history of the field, but was ultimately disappointed that the class turned out to be more about how to design a marketable product. It felt less like an introduction to the field of Human Computer Interaction as a concept and more of an introduction on how to be a start-up engineer if you want to make a successful business, which is not what I had expected at all going into the course.  Not to be completely negative though, the professor was extremely kind and generous with mistakes in work. She was also a pleasure to listen to and did her best to make lecture interesting (despite the issues I've noted with it). You can tell she's dedicated to the field, and the various speakers she brought to the class were engaging and a great opportunity to listen to. Additionally, the course staff were just excellent and extremely kind---especially in the final weeks with troubleshooting and putting the final touches on our projects.   I think it's important to note that I am not angry about the course, just disappointed and feeling a bit misled."
98027,"the TAs were a strength: Sasha, Nathan, Austin, and the other TAs were extremely kind throughout the implementation of the final project. The guest speakers were interesting, with the highlight being Prof Scaz. I don't feel like I learned that much; perhaps, more hands-on activities that were more challenging would've improved the class. Marynel was usually accommodating and genuinely cares for the students."
98027,"I wish we had more time to work on the programming aspect of our final projects. It was only fit into the the last couple of assignments of the project, when we should have started working on the programming at least for a few weeks to a month."
98027,"I thought the lectures could be a bit boring, but I enjoyed the visiting lectures and the overall material. I enjoyed the project as well"
98027,A strength was the class being accessible to everyone even non cs majors. I also feel another strength is that the content of the class is stuff that I could use when building projects for other classes. Even when building a project for another class this semester I found myself thinking of the hueristic design principles from this class. A weakness is that most of the actual building and coding happened in the last two weeks of the class. I
98027,"The course is very well-organized, and the teaching team, including the instructor and TFs, are very approachable. It is evident that the instructor is passionate about teaching. The primary focus of this course is to undertake a semester-long project, which was a great experience. However, I wish I had more time to learn practical skills regarding implementing and interface design. While I understand the critical role of theory and the design process, half of the semester was dedicated to learning theories, leaving me with only two weeks to implement them.  Moreover, after the first half, few lectures were directly related to assignments and projects, which discouraged me from attending and paying attention to them. It would be beneficial to offer more programming sessions relevant to web design, in addition to the lectures. I had limited knowledge in web design and had to teach myself most of the programming needed for the semester-long project. Including an individual assignment focused on web designing would also be great."
98027,"strengths: - design research, user research, prototyping, and user testing techniques were all interesting and relevant. - group project (is only a strength if you get paired with a good group, like I did. I heard some horror stories though) - in class activities prepare you both for the HW assignments and fort he midterm - midterm questions were fair, if you just listen in class and actually follow during lectures, the midterm will be easy. - structure of the course: the course was structured in a really good way with 1 midterm and no final. the assignments were spread out and there was enough time between each one so that you were never too stressed about it  weaknesses: - office hours: few and far between. also, each OH is only 45 minutes at a time which is not a lot of time. also, office hors were practically irrelevant for the 4/5 of the class till the final 3 weeks of the semester when we actually started coding. there should have been more office hours sessions for the times we really needed it (coding assignments vs earlier assignments that were straightforward) - timing of the assignments: the amount of assignments was fine, but the timing in which we were given certain assignments didn't make a lot of sense. we spent like 10 weeks doing very humanities based assignments like user research and brainstorming and drawing things out, which was fine. but then, we got to the last 3 weeks of the semester and had to implement an entire project using HTML, CSS, and all of this data from a sensor that more than half the class knew nothing about. it would have been much better to have fewer of the design and prototype assignments and start much much earlier on the coding part. luckily i was in a group that had 2/4 people that somewhat knew HTML, but if it weren't for them I literally would have gotten a 0 because we weren't taught any HTML and it isn't listed as a legit pre-req of knowledg"
98027,"Weakness: Poorly planned uninteresting material, lots of useless busywork. Strength: Very Easy A."
98027,"Strengths: The content was interesting and useful. The assignments gave a good opportunity for students to experience the design process and work in a group. Weaknesses: Lectures were often not very interesting to listen to. Topics seemed to be repeated throughout multiple lectures and were sometimes over-explained (e.g., how to work in groups, how to conduct interviews). The random assignment of groups also felt a bit unfair, because they were assigned in such a way that there 1-2 people experienced with JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Git were grouped with 2-3 people who were inexperienced. This pressured the more experienced members to spend more time not only doing more work but also teaching their group members the relevant skills needed for the final project. I also felt that the less experienced group members were stressed about needing to learn new languages and frameworks very quickly to keep up with the pace of the assignments. Overall, there was not enough time to code, and I think allowing students to select their own groups would have created a greater sense of responsibility across group members."
98027,The assignments of this course is very helpful in that it takes us through the entire design and implementation cycle of a product
98027,"First 80 percent of the class was just conceptual and then the last 20 percent was making the project. We went through many ""prototypes"" of our project before doing anything of substance. If this class really was about the design cycle and stuff, we should make a prototype, do user testing, and then change our prototype. We should have done real stuff before the second to last assignment."
98027,"Some of the strengths of this course were that the course is very beginner-friendly for people who are not looking for a super intense elective, and Marynel is super supportive and sweet towards all students. One place for improvement is the course timeline, as I felt all of the heavy workload coding was condensed into a few weeks towards the end of the semester."
98027,"no weaknesses, great course"
98027,strength- in-class activities were interesting and not too demanding
98027,"Strengths: Marynel is a great lecturer and her TAs care about the practice of HCI. A strength of the course is giving students exposure to the design and HCI history of many major technological innovations, having a cumulative project that reflects the iterative design cycle, and providing practice for implementing surprisingly challenging design expectations.  Weaknesses: I think the teaching staff did its best to adjust the class to such a large course, but I think the course could be a lot better if there was more conversations facilitated amongst groups regarding their design thought process. It was hard given the classroom setup and sheer number of people taking the class. I also think that I would have grown a lot if we were provided with more opportunities to ideate a project beyond the Kinect Display format. I also think that coding psets, or a couple of optional psets to help people feel more confident in their web development skills before being thrown in the deep end in the last three weeks of class would have been beneficial as well. I also thought that the content was pretty vague, but I understand that the content could not always be specific because lectures were about covering HCI practices."
98027,"A semester-long group project is a fun change from the structure of most other CS classes. This allowed us to learn more practically than in other classes. The group assignment was random though which was cool in that I met some new people. Other groups, however, seemed less functional and had group members coasting. Some of the content I felt wasn't super relevant to HCI we might do / disconnected from the project and I didn't love the participation exercises we had to do, but there was some flexibility so it wasn't too bad."
98027,"strengths: clear and accessible lectures, strong course organization (slides posted ahead of time, detailed schedule), lots of TF support, Marynel is a very kind lecturer weaknesses: groups are assigned randomly, students evaluate themselves with the collaboration record instead of evaluating each other, so it can be difficult to communicate when certain group members don't pull their weight. also, programming skills (html/css/js) aren't really taught so group members with more experience may end up working more for the final project"
98027,"A6 should be assigned earlier so that we can begin coding and more time to debug. It seems that A6 should not have the same time to complete as the other assignments. Another major improvement that should be made is to ELIMINATE randomly assigned groups. From personal experience and from listening to other recounts from the class, in several cases, one person is stuck doing 95% of the A6 assignment."
98027,"This is a really fun course. Each phase of the project takes little time to complete (except the final one). But since you have a semester group long project in several phrases and the group members are randomly assigned, it really really depends on luck. I'm lucky enough to get active and contributing group members who produced a great end product with me together. But I also have friends that got unlucky group members and had to do 90% of the work by themselves. Other than that, the lectures are pretty chill. Some parts are really fun and entertaining, some parts are boring. But the course is pretty well-designed overall because we get to practice each part of the course via small group assignments that accumulate into a big final group project which grants a huge sense of accomplishment."
98027,"The course had a lot of emphasis and repetition on the course material and the important points to consider when designing a product, so it was fairly easy to review concepts from class."
98027,"A lot of time was spent on design and user research, which are important topics but I wish more time was spent on teaching us how to implement projects because once that stage of the semester-long project started, it felt very rushed and many of us were confused as beginners."
98027,"Almost no coding till the very end is really odd for a CS class, and then the final projects were somewhat sped up with no guidance"
98027,"This course possesses several strengths that contribute to its effectiveness. Firstly, it is accessible to both computer science majors and non-majors, making it a suitable option for a wide range of students. Moreover, the course strikes a balance between theoretical knowledge and practical application, allowing students to actively build upon what they are learning. However, there is one notable weakness in the course, which is the mandatory attendance policy. While attendance can be beneficial for engagement and interaction, it may limit flexibility for students with conflicting schedules or other commitments. To further improve the course, considering a more flexible approach to attendance, such as providing alternative learning options or recorded lectures, could enhance the overall learning experience for students."
98027,"The course is well organized and prepared, but the schedule of each assignment is a little tight."
98027,strengths: project is highly related to course materials weakness: the second half of the course is less informative
98027,Very well-organized course. The Professor is very caring and knowledgable.
98027,"Strengths: The prof + the actual material of the class + the very amazing guest speakers  Weakness: Some of the classes honestly felt a bit boring, but that was not a big issue; I enjoyed most of the lectures I went to"
98027,I think it would be good to have more smaller exams throughout the semester so that we can actually show our mastery of the Contant instead of just a big project which takes a lot of coding knowledge to complete
98027,"Engagement was pretty low as a weakness. Furthermore, the pacing of projects as it went from conceptual application to coding was very, very bad. I think that if coding was part of the previous group assignments, not a lot of the groups would have had as much difficulty cranking the project out."
98027,"Strengths: I could tell that Professor Vasquez was really trying her best to engage the class through in-class activities, along with more dynamic PPTs. Really giving her credit for trying to make this CS class more dynamic and less lecture-y than other ones in the department. I also really liked how we were able to apply these principles through an in-class project. Finally, I really liked that Professor Vasquez invited some guest speakers to talk about their work.   Weaknesses: Some of the lectures were a little bit ""fluffy"" in terms of learning principles. I think for a hands-on class like this, it would have been better to actually ask students to ""learn by doing"" rather than ""learn by understanding"" -- perhaps, by putting students in their lecture groups in class as the in-class activity."
98027,"Strengths: guest lecturers were very knowledgeable about their fields, well organized course material Weaknesses: course material wasn't the most exciting"
98027,"Strengths: semester-long project, very digestible content presented in a way where it clearly builds on top of each other, good mix of examples and ideas within the field  Weaknesses: the coding/implementation part of the project seemed much more work in a short period of time and was a bit unclear with regards to implementation compared to the other parts of the project"
98027,"I feel like the structure of the course could be better organized, the project itself felt rushed even though it's a semester long project. I feel like we should start the implementation a bit earlier."
98027,"Strengths: I liked how we were assigned to groups because I got to meet and work with some really cool people all semester who I did not know at all before taking this course and we made something we could be proud of.  I liked the lectures (including the guest lectures) and the in-class activities. Of course the in-class activities forced me to pay attention but it also minimized outside work for the class which is such a plus. We also had opportunities to work with other people for some of the activities and that was really nice.   Weaknesses: I wish we had more time, like a month, to implement the final project because it felt a bit rushed at the end and my team was grinding in the last few days to work out the bugs, adapt it for the display, and get it done."
98117,overall good
98117,Strengths were the selection of readings and the structure of the course.
98117,"The strengths are the structure, Professor Kim's thoughtfully-designed lessons, and the engaging discussions. Not a lot of weaknesses, but maybe just the wide variation in reading lengthsometimes we had only a single paper to review and sometimes we had an entire book."
98117,"Professor Kim is deeply knowledgable about the subject, and clearly has a passion for the material. I found the structure of each class first half lecture, second half discussion to be helpful."
98117,"This class was pretty disappointing to me. I was looking forward to learning more about religion in Korea having; with knowledge of Catholic theology and having taken a class on Chinese philosophy, I thought it would be an interesting intersection of other religious studies courses I have taken. However, lectures were very basic and I do not feel like I learned anything from the lectures. The readings were interesting, but the second half of every class was taken up by a student presentation summarizing the readings with discussion questions and that also was not very engaging."
98117,"Strengths: I really enjoyed the student-led presentations/discussions. Readings were mostly very interesting, and people were pretty engaged with the seminar discussions. I also appreciated how the course encouraged students to attend outside lectures on Korean religion and culture happening throughout the university."
98117,Strength is the class size and Professor Hwansoo Kim. He cares about students' learning and happiness. It is a good class. No weakness.
98117,The class was well structured with weekly assignments allowing for reflection of the readings.
98117,"The splitting up into different sections was nice, but also led, at times, to everyone in class not really taking the latter half of class seriously. Most of the time people would be on laptops doing something else while others were presenting or whatnot, and this led to less interesting/involved discussion."
98117,Hwansoo is the BEST professor I have ever had in my four years at Yale.
98117,"The lectures are intersting, coursework is light and PROFESSOR KIM IS AMAZING. I had no interest in the course material going in, and only took it because I heard professor Kim was good, and it ended up being such an amazing course. There are no tests or quizzes on lecture material, which means you can go to each lecture and just listen, you don't have to worry about taking notes and remembering every detail, which means you can actually enjoy lectures. The main strength of this course is absolutely professor Kim, and just going and listening to lectures was fun even for someone who had no prior interest in the subject.  Every week you need to do a short reading and write a short discussion post (300 words). Can be done in about an hour. Final project can be a 10 page paper, or you can do a more interesting project (podcasts, artwork, poems) and write 3 pages. Professor Kim is super helpful about picking topics and projects, so don't worry about this at all.   I don't think you need to be, but if you are worried you can also attend guest lectures (usually 1-2 a week, about an hour and a half long) and you get 1% bonus on your FINAL GRADE for EACH ONE. These lectures can be hit or miss, but with the incentive of extra credit I found myself going to a bunch and it was pretty enjoyable."
98117,The course was extremely well run despite sometimes being at the mercy of guest lecturers. I thought the professor and TF handled coordination really well. It was refreshing to have guest speakers from different backgrounds and perspectives.
98117,Professor Kim was definitely the strength of course! He was such a great professor and so understanding! He made the class so interesting and the discussions in the class were also great! He makes the class focus more on the enjoyment of learning instead of focusing on grades! There is no weakness to this class
98117,I really enjoyed the course format! The seminar format in a larger class size works very well and they split the class in a seamless way to maximize our time.
98117,"Strength: Hwansoo kim, Jusung Lee they were so great"
98117,Strengths: Super chill and relaxing environment!! I liked the structure of the class where it was a good combination of lecture from Prof Kim and student led seminars   Weaknesses: None!
98117,"Strength: very high level of engagement. The Professor is an animated, cool speaker who takes care to try to remember everyones names and direct the lecture in a way thats absolutely riveting.  Weakness: I wish at times, we could submit 1-2 of our weekly reflections and ask for feedback. Sometimes, I felt like I was writing them just for the sake of work and they wouldnt get seen. I wish I couldve gotten some feedback so I can improve on my writing and my critical thinking on the course."
98117,"good discussion, however it may be advantageous to form smaller sections to facilitate active participation for more students"
98129,"Strengths: - Prof. Drixler is absolutely fantastic. Lectures are consistently engaging with slides that highlight the art, stories, maps, and culture of Tokugawa Japan. He'll often be so engrossed in the material and it is infectious. I also loved the stories he would tell in class of Tokugawa Japan, which would symbolize broader historical themes. I can still recall the story of the German doctor Philipp Franz von Siebold visiting Japan and having a child there before being kicked out and eventually making his way later in his life, seeing his adult daughter who'd followed in his footsteps as a physician.  - Notes for each lecture were a great touch.  - The sheer breadth of material is incredibly impressive. You come in knowing nothing and leave with a broad view of what Tokugawa society was like, all the way down to their values, their traditions, their stories, their art, and much more.  Weaknesses: - The pset took longer than was estimated. It was supposed to take around 3 hours when realistically me and other students in the class took over double that. However, there was also only one pset, so it was a minor detriment on the course. - Readings were usually only marginally relevant to lecture and were mainly for section. It felt like we could've done without them, and on the exams, there wasn't much incentive to read them since most of the content tested was from lectures. However, readings were usually less than 50 pages per week, so not a big concern. - It was stated in the syllabus that lectures would often end early but this only happened a few times throughout the whole semester. I'm totally fine with lectures being 75 minutes, but I think it should be communicated that they'll more often than not last the whole time."
98129,"Strengths: Drixler's lecture style is engaging, and his handouts are great for note taking/review; reading load is manageable Weaknesses: the final was a bit excessive in terms of amount of writing, and the lack of choices on the ID list for the midterm/final seems unnecessarily restrictive; some of the material is more interesting than other parts"
98129,Very strong course. Professor Drixler knows an incredible amount about the subject and his passion for the history comes through. The course also approaches the history of Tokugawa Japan from more angles than most introductory history courses.
98129,The content was extremely engaging and Prof. Drixler was excellent with the lectures and the slides. The readings were sometimes difficult but the section leaders made it easier.
98129,I found this course super interesting and the professor Drixler was super passionate. I was surprised by how much I learned by the end.
98129,The lecture guides were a great way to keep straight what were sometimes seemingly disorganized lectures. They were also awesome study tools.
98129,"The strengths of the course are the professor and his lectures. I was never bored during the 75 minute lectures, as Professor Drixler is very eloquent and engaging, The readings for the course are also relevant and interesting. A weakness of the course is that some of the assignments seemed to be irrelevant to truly learning the material. In my opinion, a detailed map quiz is a pointless exercise in rote memorization one would expect in a typical American high school. The essay prompts were excessively unique (i.e. writing captions for period artwork). I think that traditional papers and exams have stood the test of time because they best facilitate and reflect learning at a high level. Quirky essays and rote memorization seem more appropriate for a ninth grader than for a Yale University student."
98129,I felt like the midterm and final ID questions were a little unreasonably difficult.
98129,The lectures were excellent but there weren't many assignments to contribute to the grade.
98129,Professor Drixler is so passionate and kind. Very engaging lecturer even when the content itself initially feels less interesting. Readings arent too heavy which allows you to actually engage with them.
98129,I thought the pset was a little hard to find the information for.
98129,Very well organized course and Professor Drixler is an incredible lecturer. The content of the course alone is super fascinating.
98129,The problem set was unreasonably hard.
98129,"Professor Drixler's attitude towards his lectures is perfect. He speaks with engaging delivery, a variety of visual content, and helpful/unintrusive tangents that almost never distract or drag. He includes breaks in lectures, which is thoughtful. His promise to keep lectures closer to 50 than 75 minutes was good in spirit, but didn't usually come true in practice--which is fine, because the lectures almost never felt like 75 minutes anyway. Handouts were a useful supplement for my own notes, particularly for anticipating ID terms on exams.  The problem set was fun and unique; a good blend between (1) the know-when-you've-answered-the-question feeling you get in STEM and (2) the archival exploration you get for history research papers. The problem set could use clearer guidelines on acceptable sources--I spent a lot of time trying to find academic sources (e.g., journal articles and books) for facts that were visible on the first page of Google and I'm not sure whether that level of research was necessary.  The readings were useful, interesting, and a good length; manageable."
98129,"No weaknesses, content was amazing"
98129,"There are only strengths to this course! No weaknesses at all! The syllabus was so well-structured, especially with all of the printed handouts that Professor Drixler made for us. I loved all of the visuals that Professor Drixler used in his slides - they made lectures very engaging. The readings were really interesting as well. I also thought the problem set assignment was a huge strength because it was unlike anything I had done in other history courses, but it led me to conduct really interesting research and learn a lot more about Tokugawa Japan."
98129,"Prof. Drixler definitely knows his stuff when it comes to Edo period and his researches are the most exciting parts of the course. The introductory section, though, felt too long and dragged out until almost midterm."
98129,"One point of improvement could be the structure and organization of the course's canvas page, as some links on the page were not properly updated or fixed until some time had passed in the course. Besides that, the overall structure and pacing of the lectures were pretty straightforward. The discussion sections also served as a great space to digest the various readings, as well as connecting it to information from lecture."
98156,"This is just your standard intro lecture class. It's not bad per se, but it's not designed to be super exciting"
98156,"Very lecture-y, variance of TA levels, and lack of recordings were weaknesses. At the end of the day though, if you put in work, you learn a bit."
98156,"Personally, I would have liked to see more PSet/exam-like problems walked through in class."
98156,"The course was structured so that students could learn in the lecture and practice what they learned in their discussion sections, which I felt like was a strength. One weakness was that the lectures were not recorded, so it was harder to understand the lessons if you wanted to rewatch part of a lecture that you didn't understand the first time around."
98156,"Strengths: content. Weaknesses: lack of example problems in lecture, going too fast during lecture."
98156,"I feel that the syllabus is pretty strong although I didn't enjoy the lectures at all. Maybe it's just a me thing, but it was challenging to connect the way material was presented during the lectures to its application in psets. Discussion section helped here a lot."
98156,This course was just fine. Not very engaging and often hard to follow.
98156,"Strengths: Lots of office hours opportunities, manageable workload, manageable exam difficulty level Weaknesses: none"
98156,This courses lectures can be a bit long and they need more example problems. The problem sets could be a little more difficult to match the level of the exam problems and prepare the students better. The workshops are great problems and examples to help with the course.
98156,"This class was well-organized, well-taught, and it felt very fair. The problem sets were doable and didn't feel like a major burden. I think that the midterms were well-time in terms of when they were administered during the semester. A weakness of this course was the 1.5-hour lectures. I struggle to sit still and focus on one subject for that amount of time. I think it would be far more conducive to learning to have three lectures per week, 50 minutes each."
98156,"The course was very basic with not any knowledge needed beforehand to grasp the topics, it is a true intro course so is correctly advertised. The amount of office hours and sections are more than enough for anyone struggling with material."
98156,Strengths: the curve. Weakness would probably be how unnecessarily difficult the course is considering its an introductory course that is NOT meant to be a weed-out.
98156,"I think the topics were all very interesting, but lecture was not as engaging as it could have been. I found it hard, especially in the second half of the semester, to pay attention, and this seemed to be a common theme among my peers. I think introducing examples that would connect more to our daily lives when introducing new topics could be helpful and intriguing."
98156,It's a good intro course and covers a lot of topics. The course was organized and extra help was available. The lectures were less engaging but I think it's just the nature of an introductory lecture course.
98156,"Lectures often confused me and I really only gained some understanding of the concepts from office hours and section. More clarity in the lectures would be appreciated, also recordings. A bit more understanding as well that this is a beginner class; I had no economics experience entering the class and quickly became lost."
98156,The lecture notes could be better.
98156,"Strenghts: As a humanities-student who are enrolled in a lot of smaller seminar courses, in which the level and system of organization depends greatly on the style and preferences of the individual professor, taking a large and well-organized class such as ECON 115 has been a pleasure. In my opinion, the system with two lectures a week and a voluntary smaller discussion session that one could attend in weeks where one needed extra support / time to ask questions, but where attendance was at one's own discretion, was extremely effective. Only towards the end of the semester did I start to benefit from student office hours as well as the larger review sessions held before the exam/midterms, which are two excellent resources that I know so many students found extremely helpful. I appreciate that all the class material (lecture notes, but also answers to problem sets and review session materials) was posted on the well-organized canvas page, which made preparing for the final exam so much easier. The graded problem sets was a good way to ensure that one stayed on top of the material, and they were organized in a didactic way which helped me better grasp the concepts discussed in class.  Weaknesses: The lectures could have been more interactive, and while the slideshows were clear it was sometimes hard to understand (especially regarding more analytical content) which parts of the lecture were tangental / central to a topic. I'm thinking for example of the distinction between the Cournot and Bertrand models of competition for duopolies, which turned out to be a key distinction for organizing the oligopoly-content, whereas the Bertrand alternative only appeared as an interesting extra piece of information during lecture."
98156,"I think the textbook was very helpful but I do wish the lecture notes were more clear or the lectures were recorded. It was very hard to hear the professor in lecture and he did move from topic to topic very fast, so it definitely would have been helpful to have some sort of clear organized notes to study from or to have access to the lecture recordings."
98156,Course was organized and structured well and lectures and discussion sections were great.
98156,"Lecture often moved too quickly, in my opinion. Prof. Berry spoke in grand terms to explain things that were actually really simple topics when I taught them to myself. I feel like the course required background knowledge that I didnt have."
98156,"If the class were recorded, that would've helped a lot. Going back through the slides in preparation for the midterm/final and deciphering what was taught in the lecture weeks ago was sometimes challenging."
98156,I think this course is taught very well.
98156,The lecture was very very disengaging and often times hard to follow. I often felt that the questions on the midterms or finals werent representative of what we learned as we did not go over much math at all during the lectures but that was what the exam was mainly made up of.
98156,This course could be improved with lecture recordings. I found it hard to catch up if I could not attend a class.
98156,strengths: informative introduction to macro weaknesses: could be more engaging
98156,I enjoyed this course. I think we couldve solved more example questions in lectures.
98156,The teaching was extremely theoretical and did not have much application based learning. This made the subject very hard to understand. The teacher also did not answer questions well.
98156,Honestly no clear weaknesses. Dope.
98156,Weakness: Lectures were taught too fast  Strength: Interesting material
98156,"strengths: the overall progression of content made sense weaknesses: too abstract at times, professor was hard to hear, examples provided weren't the most concrete"
98156,"Lots of student support and resources, slower lectures with clearer instruction; very good TAs, office hours, peer review sessions, and midterm review sessions"
98156,"Section is very helpful. The exams are modeled after the problem sets well. The exams did a good job of testing us on what we learned, but in ways that were not repeating processes we had done before. They forced us to apply what we learned in lecture."
98156,You learn a lot. Thats also a weaknesstheres a lot of content.
98156,"The lecturer was difficult to understand when he was speaking and he often did not fully explain concepts, even when prompted by student questions. He was also not understanding when students needed to adjust exam dates or use accessibility accommodations. I appreciated the review sessions before the midterm and the final, they helped me to study a lot."
98156,"Lectures moved very fast and were not recorded, which was tricky"
98156,"The problem sets were very manageable. It was possible to complete a problem set in as little as two hours, which was nice. The course, however, had no additional resources to learn from. There was a textbook, apparently, but there were no assigned readings. The lectures weren't recorded so we couldn't go back to understand Professor Berry's mumbles."
98156,Lectures are not recorded which puts those who have emergencies at a disadvantage.
98156,"Lecture moves pretty quickly, sometimes its hard for me to keep up especially since all the materials were first exposure materials"
98156,"This course I would say is a very good introduction to microeconomics. I have a really solid understanding of the behavior of mass consumers and of firms, as well as how to measure their ideal action. This part I really through was tended to well.  I would say that the more individual level of microeconomics was not touched on as well; I feel that I understand firms but not necessarily the way I should act financially, with investments etc, but I am sure that this will come later down the line.  The slides were of a great help in studying, and it was very accessible in terms of peer tutoring and office hours. Although, there was little feedback on exams."
98156,"Strengths: The course was very well formatted and seemed clear. Weaknesses: A lot of material was crammed in right before (the week of) midterms, especially I felt that way for the second midterm."
98156,"I wish we had done more concrete examples in class, as a lot of the problem sets and tests had questions that we didnt go over in class. But section and the review sessions were super helpful in that regard, so the TAs did a really good job there"
98156,Video lecture recordings or more detailed lecture notes would be helpful for reviewing material.
98156,"Strengths: This course was very accessible and there are a ton of resources that students can turn to for assistance, including peer tutors and TFs. Problem sets were pretty fair and so were exams. Lectures were pretty clear and as long as you attended, you could apply what you learned to completing problem sets and studying for exams. Sections were super helpful because we covered the exact kinds of questions you would see on the problem sets of the week.   Weaknesses: Lectures were pretty centered around concepts and less so applications of those concepts so problem sets often took extra assistance to complete."
98156,"The strengths of the course are the nature of the lectures, which are informative but also interesting and applicable to larger concepts, and the usage of discussion section to practice concepts discussed in lecture.  Due to the amount of content however, lectures had less of the math/equation content discussed, as it was mostly discussed during section. Including more math practice in lecture could improve student's understanding of the course even further."
98156,"The lecture format makes it so that people are not rarely invested committed to the class. Students are too much on their own and the resources at their disposal are often insufficient to get a proper grip of the material. Section never covers all the material that was prepared. And it overall just feels like there is very little accompaniment for an institution of Yales caliber. ECON 115 could be an online course taken from an online educational provider and the difference would not feel very significant from what it is now as a Yale college lecture. The TAs and course director have very limited availability and there is virtually no individualized feedback or support on how to improve in the course unless the student insists and takes a lot of initiative, which would be a fair expectation if the resources at our disposal were superbly efficient at providing individual feedback when asked for, but they are not."
98156,"Professor Barry was very nice, however sometimes in class it was hard to follow along because he moved fast and mumbled sometimes. Great and kind professor though."
98156,Strengths: Section was very well taught Weaknesses: Peer tutoring was not well facilitated; peer tutors did not try to help students understand content material but rather preferred to hand out the answer and move on.
98156,"I would say concepts are explained very well, however the course moves rather slowly"
98156,"Weakness: Lectures are not recorded, so even if you go to every class, you can't review the material well if you don't understand it the first time. Plus, it's fast-paced so it's hard to keep up."
98156,"I think that section was a great strength of this course. Though they were technically optional, I went to every section and found it to be a great expansion/ explanation of material that the professor may have glossed over or quickly gone through. I also think that the large class size was a benefit as it was better to have friends to compare PSETs with. I will also say that the shorter length PSETs was a huge relief in comparison to courses that have PSETs which take 6+ hours. I found that ECON PSETs were engaging and took only around 2 hours."
98156,"Strengths: teaches many concepts abstractically or in a math context Weakness: the lecture style was really a downside for me and the discussions not being mandatory did not motivate me to attend so I struggled to understand a lot of the concepts because of the lack of commitment mechanisms. So you would really have to trust your own work ethic. Also, the class is not recorded so it is hard to keep up when you miss a day because the slides alone cannot help you understand the topics."
98156,It was a very large course.
98156,"Strengths: Well-structured and efficient lectures, problem sets and section genuinely helped me understand the material better, tons of office hours across all of the TAs and plenty of opportunities to get help when needed.  Weaknesses: It was difficult to get clear feedback from graders on mistakes in problem sets and exams."
98156,"I think that lectures should be recorded because if a student has o miss a lecture, they should be able to learn the material regardless. At the beginning of the term, the lecturer claimed that one of the reasons that they were not recording lectures was because, in the semester before, recorded lectures would be watched much more before midterms and finals. Personally, I do not think that the study habits of students should influence the overall course."
98156,"There is a lot of support provided to students in discussion sections, peer tutoring sessions, and office hours. But oftentimes these were necessary supplements to the lectures, which weren't always clear and required outside learning to fully understand to the point of being able to review them."
98167,"The strengths are that the course was very organized with lecture summaries, worksheets, problem sets and peer tutoring. The only weakness I have is that sometimes I felt like the problem sets were too geared towards students needing to perform their own research, when we won't be able to perform research during an exam."
98167,"The second half of the course felt like a finance prep course, which I was not expecting. I think it would have been helpful to know that from the start of the semester. A strength of the course was its organization. Dr. Hawkins had so many resources for us at all times."
98167,Lecture could be less jokes and more just teach us the stuff.
98167,"Strengths: Topics are very interesting and applicable. Well-organized class. Prof. Tsyvinski is very funny and a great guy. Prof. Hawkins is also an incredible teacher, and his organization of the class is amazing. The worksheets and Psets are great at reinforcing the concepts. Weaknesses: Prof. Tsyvinski is a great guy, but his lecturing style is not very good for actually learning the concepts. He often goes off-topic or barely explains what's on the slides."
98167,"I appreciated the lecture slides, as they were always very detailed and helped provide a perfect summary of what was covered in each lesson."
98167,"No weaknesses. I think maybe the exams should not place so much emphasis on multiple choice. If you miss one MC question you're down 5 points, which is actually quite significant. Lectures maybe a bit slow/boring.  Otherwise, I felt like Aleh was a really great professor and the lectures followed the PSets rly well. I genuinely enjoyed learning this stuff and felt well supported in section.  William Hawkins is the GOAT."
98167,I think the structure of the lectures and content could be improved to increase engagement and maybe peak slightly more interest from students.
98167,The professor kept me engaged. Lecture format should be technology-free to force people to pay better attention.
98167,Weakness: Not recorded.
98167,Interactive with good psets and sections to review key concepts of each week's lectures.
98167,"Strengths- Dr. Hawkins has a lot of resources on the Ed Discussion, so it's easier to study for exams. Weaknesses- I didn't feel like lectures were very engaging."
98167,The problem sets were a bit vague. The worksheets were very helpful and well organized.
98167,"Strengths: posted slides, good TFS, funny prof, helpful and kinda fun worksheets. Weaknesses: the grading rubric for the psets was very specific and not always easy to anticipate. Instead of giving a good answer, you had to give one specific answer, ex. needing an example when the question doesn't mention that you need to provide one."
98167,The strength of the course was organization and very knowledgeable professors.
98167,Super well organized.  Also very boring.
98167,Lectures can be fun but feel drawn out. It doesn't feel worth it to be there for a full 75 minutes.
98167,I think the strengths of the course was that students were really well prepared for the exam and the professor was extremely interesting. A weakness I would say would be that class size was possibly too big.
98167,"Very strong director with strong Ed presence, great practice tests,  Slides need to be clearer, can be more efficient, lots of random talk in lecture which is funny and nice and interactive but can get confusing. Left every lecture (I attended every one) not knowing much, and forgot everything the next day."
98167,"Strengths: Hawkins. This man is an absolute legend. He not only shows that he fully understands everything, but he's also great at teaching it. I wish he would've been the lecturer, because his reviews and section were always extremely rewarding. Weaknesses: Lectures are not taught well. Most of the times it was just him reading what the slides were, and still going too fast. I found that not going to lecture and reviewing the slides on my own often led to a deeper understanding."
98167,"Strengths - Dr. Hawkins is the BEST section leader!!! Great teacher and always enthusiastic about teaching macro. Weaknesses - I love Professor Tsyvinski, and he's hilarious and goes off track sometimes because that's his humor, but he's kind of less enthusiastic about lecturing and just reads off the slides. I often doze off, but maybe that's because I am just not that interested in the class. I think if Dr. Hawkins taught it, it would be an amazing class and more easy to understand for me."
98167,"The lectures are very informative, and the course is set up so that topics that are interconnected are taught together."
98167,"The strengths of the class are definitely Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins. The class is also extremely well-organized, with plenty of opportunities to get help in office hours. However, it definitely felt much more difficult to stay engaged than I have felt with other economics classes, and this was not a class anyone I know was particularly excited about. I felt as though exams were not always a good test of our knowledge."
98167,It was a super solid course! Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins have really mastered the introductory lecture-series format.
98167,favorite intro econ here
98167,Strengths: good organization and engaging teacher and plenty of office hours
98167,"Strengths - This class was a great crossover between basic mathematical topics and more difficult worldwide phenomena. I think its biggest strength was the combination of Professor Tsyvinski with Dr. Hawkins. They are not only knowledgeable beyond belief but also a ""dynamic duo"" teaching team."
98167,"The lectures were difficult to follow because there was a lot of content from the slides to write down and not enough time to process what was being said by the professor while writing. However, the course was extremely well organized and offered countless resources for help, so even if you could not follow along in lecture, there were plenty of ways you could grasp the content."
98167,"No weaknesses, I thought this class was amazing."
98167,"Strengths: the material is very interesting and presented in a digestible way. There's plenty of support for students (sections, office hours, review sessions). Professor Tsyvinski is also a great lecturer; he inserts jokes to make class funny and plays along with students' shenanigans.   Weaknesses: Doesn't emphasize intuition enough. I think the most important thing for understanding econ is to have intuition (why do curves on the graphs move in a certain way?). I would also like to see more quantitative rigor (why are equations for describing certain models the way that they are?)."
98167,"Lecture is great and so it peer tutoring, test reviews could be better."
98167,"I think that this course is only as much as you put into it. If you are willing to put in the hours to learn the material, than I think you will find that your efforts will reward you...for the most part. There are lots of resources if you need help with the Psets like office hours and review sessions during final season. Tsvinski is a great guy and I appreciate his attempt to engage the audience during lectures, although I think that the only reason I didn't enjoy this course too much is that I discovered I'm just not too interested in the material."
98167,Strengths: rigorous; covers lots of breadth. Weaknesses: none.
98167,I thought that the class grading was handled very well along with the lecture teachings.
98167,Very organized! Lecture was as engaging as can be for a large lecture course and all the psets were pretty manageable.
98167,"Strengths: Good lecturer, interesting examples and engaging classes. Weaknesses: Terrible admin, Exams had extremely poorly written questions that didn't test student understanding but rather semantic games."
98167,Good class
98167,"Strengths: Great TA system, plenty of opportunities to do well in the course such as office hours, multiple TA sections, understandable feedback, etc. Weaknesses: None"
98167,One of the course's greatest strengths is that it is very structured as it has regular sections and office hours alongside weekly lectures.
98167,It was very well organized. I think it could have been taught more efficiently and interestingly.
98167,Not great for non majors
98167,"Strengths: amount of resources (office hours, worksheets, great and FREE textbook, etc.)  Weakness: Lecture slides and lecture in general not too engaging"
98167,The exams felt impossible as it seemed like there were always many correct answers to the same questions
98167,The course was extremely well organized and well run thanks to Hawkins.
98167,"I thought the organization of this class was fantastic. The homework assignments, worksheets (essentially just required practice problems with unlimited attempts so you can get a perfect score), online ed board, and lecture summaries were so helpful when it came to reviewing and learning content. Tsyvinski was hilarious and engaging, Hawkins' organizational skills were amazing, and overall, the class was incredibly well run!"
98167,"The class was well organized in general, and Professor Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins were both incredibly charismatic, helpful, and kind. I felt that I learned a lot."
98167,"The professors were very entertaining and the way they taught was able to keep the students engaged. Also, the office hours were very helpful for explaining the content. The main challenge I faced was that at times I had difficulty answering the exam questions because it was challenging for me to answer application based questions."
98167,Very well organized
98167,"Prof Tsyvinski is very engaging and good at explaining the concepts. The course is incredibly well organized, with many resources available to students."
98167,I think having PSets due on Mondays is better than Fridays. Also I found it a little distracting at times when the lectures went too far off topic.
98167,some topics are very interewting while others wer rather boring and didn't give much to me
98167,There could be more practice during lectures.
98167,This course was very interesting and has no weaknesses.
98167,The content is very interesting and I the lectures kept me engaged.
98167,There should be Slower lecture and better discussion section.
98167,Very helpful course director and many materials and office hours and resources
98167,"Strengths: Well organized, interesting, informative  Weaknesses: None in particular"
98167,"Strengths: Very well organized, a lot of help is available. The material was overall very well presented Weaknesses: I feel like there was a lot of memorization of little detail required that made the course less engaging."
98167,"I really think the lectures are set up nicely, and there are enough practice problems for each topic to help you understand concepts."
98167,"My weakness was connecting topics in the class, my strength was learning individual topics."
98167,More sections
98167,Strengths: abundant resources for studying for the exams and just the course in general  Weakness: lectures werent all that engaging. A lot of people just end up copying from the slides
98167,I think that it was taught well
98167,Strength was the amount of resources available. Weakness does not come to mind.
98167,"The course was incredibly well-organized and the grading process was very efficient. There were many easily-available resources to learn, and they all helped a great deal."
98167,"I think that p sets could be more clear about what they wanted students to write. For instance, at times I thought I got points taken off for things that were never asked of me. I also thought there was a large difficulty mismatch between the midterms and the final. The midterms were doable, but the final was overly hard. I think it's a bit unfair to ask students to memorize specific statistics (e.g. growth rates of different countries through time)."
98167,Strengths are the the logical nature of the course content. Weaknesses are the lectures which are sometimes hard to follow
98167,strenghts--> interesting content weaknesses --> the midterm content was alright for me but the final felt like too much information and content so i can difficulty doing well
98167,"A strength of this course was the amount of resources outside class provided (office hours, peer tutors, Ed, etc.). I disliked some of the exam questions' ability to manipulate the material even when the general knowledge was there."
98167,Great faculty
98167,The course was very well organized. Prof tsyvisnki is a great instructor.
98167,I think the professor was a clear strength. He was always engaging and had a great sense of humor. I think perhaps the pace was a bit too fast and it was hard to keep up. I also think having the lecture recordings in advance would be better.
98167,"The main strength is the organization of the course. Prof. Tsyvinski is a wonderful lecturer. Every lecture has accompanying lecture notes which summarize what we learned. Psets are graded promptly and regrades are well processed. Leading up to exams there are many review sessions offered. The ones with Dr. Hawkins are especially helpful. If there is one weakness, however it is a personal opinion, is that class recordings are not uploaded. While I understand that this is so that students will show up to class, I still believe there is merit in the accessibility and flexibility that having class recordings uploaded offers."
98167,"Strengths: Professor Tsyvinsky and Professor Hawkins teach the course in a very interesting and easy to follow way. It remains engaging and interesting from beginning to end. If you enjoy economics, take this course."
98167,This course provides worksheets which are very helpful to learning but its problem sets are often not clearly relevant to the skills being taught.
98167,I have heard good reviews about introductory economics itself but I did not like the way that Prof. Tsvinsky and Prof. Hawkins taught the class.
98167,"Strengths, depth of resources available is large especially before the exam. Weaknesses the lecture doesnt always capture as much detail as the textbook does, and sometimes I feel that they both dont when it comes to answering the trickier true false questions on psets."
98167,"Strengths: Great resources for study and help, William & peer tutors are very knowledgeable and great. Weaknesses: Lectures could be taught a bit slower. And the final exam was extremely difficult!!"
98167,"Sometimes the lectures weren't as concise as I would have preferred. While they provided good review, I also found the discussion sections to be a little on the basic and dry side (especially compared to the material in the problem sets)."
98167,"Strengths: The course was very well taught, the material was fascinating and consistently connected to other aspects of life, politics, and the economic system, and improved my thinking abilities.  Weaknesses: The exam questions were less straightforward than they ought to have been and the sections each week weren't very helpful."
98167,"The curve was difficult to manage because if i dropped even one point, my grade would be dropped a whole letter."
98167,"Strengths: Alot of support to students with oh, review sessions etc. Great teachers and also clear syllabus.  Weaknesses: None"
98167,"lectures aren't very helpful, psets are pretty dry  material and professor are very interesting  peer tutors were awesome"
98167,The strength is definitely the unique insights that the Professor provides through lectures and the textbook as well as how organized the course is. I cant think of a weakness.
98167,"strengths: CLARITY AND RESOURCES!! the lecture summaries, plenty of practice tests, and worksheets. there are so many readily and clearly available resources to support students.  weaknesses: no lecture recordings :("
98167,"Sections are very good, worksheets as well. Lecture itself not that insightful."
98167,I wish the course offered the virtual lectures on canvas.
98167,Worksheets are very useful in understanding the practicality and problem solving of the information. Problem sets are well designed to prepare us for tests and many resources to work through problem sets. Lectures can contain a lot of information that feel overwhelming and messy at times.
98167,"I believe the instructions were very clear, the sections were helpful, the worksheets reenforced the content, the problem sets were fair, and the tests were completely fair as well. I think this course could have done a better job at relating the lectures to the problem sets and tests."
98167,"Strengths: I liked how the lecture slides were posted because sometimes the lecture went too fast for me to keep up with all my notes during class. Weaknesses: I feel like the multiple choice questions on some of the exams were difficult just because I wasn't exactly sure how to study for that section since I wasn't sure which numbers I needed to know, but overall not many weaknesses!"
98167,"The strengths of this class include section, the ED platform, and various review materials. One weakness of this class was that a lot of new material would be covered in just one lecture."
98167,"Good amount of weekly work, excellent support through office hours for help. Interesting ideas included in lectures that are good supplements to actual course.  Too much content in lectures that is often impossible to take notes on. Slides contain overwhelming amounts of information oftentimes. Prof goes too fast sometimes."
98167,"A strength would be the organization of this class. It was very well thought out and provided support to students in need of more practice or discussion on the material. However, I was a bit overwhelmed towards the end of the semester. It was a lot of material and sometimes I felt like I could not gain more insight than surface level information. Also, I would say the final exam was a bit unfair and tested the most difficult material of all of the semester, without going into depth on the newer material, which had not been tested on yet."
98167,Strengths: super super well organized. There's a ton of support to help you get through the class. Professor is passionate and tries to make lectures interesting.  Weaknesses: it's a massive lecture class so you will space out.
98167,"I understand that they didnt release the lectures because they wanted people in class, but Im someone that works much better if I can be flexible and watch a class on 1.5x speed and take notes if necessary. Really liked Aleh and Hawkins."
98167,"The strengths of this course include the consistent PSETS and the number of office hours that you can attend. The weakness has to be the size, it is sometimes hard to concentrate with so many people."
98167,I think that this course could be improved by having more clear instruction we need to know for exams.
98167,I think sometimes the content of the slides and the lesson summaries would not necessarily echo the extent of content covered in the class
98167,"Strength: ed discussion is a really good resource since questions are anonymous and can be answered quickly. Weakness: Some of the concepts are really hard to understand, especially the subtleties of the solow model."
98167,I honestly dont really see any weaknesses. I wish the first two midterms were slightly harder I guess so the mean isnt so impossibly high.
98167,The strength of this course is that it taught one all they needed to know about introductory macroeconomics. The weakness of this course is that it often had a very high workload.
98167,Strengths: The class was very organized and the PSets covered the material well. Weaknesses: Sometimes the content was covered a little fast.
98167,"The strengths of the course are the slides and lecture which I thnk are very well put together. However, I think that the lecture goes over content a bit too fast, and it would be better if it were slowed down."
98167,I feel that lecture recordings should have been uploaded after the completion of the weekly problem set. I understand that they are attempting to maximize attendance. However I feel that there is no reason to not upload them after the problem set for the corresponding material is completed. I felt this seriously hindered my learning
98167,This course should allow lecture recordings to be publicly available
98167,"Weaknesses lots of information to take in in large groups, strengths include good teacher."
98167,"- strengths: diversity of material (worksheets + lecture summaries + psets) -- that was very helpful ; a lot of real-life examples, which helps to understand the material more in the context  - weaknesses: nothing specific"
98167,"strength: most organized course I have ever been enrolled in, lecture is very engaging and students have a lot of resources.  weakness: a lot of material is covered and it can be hard to differentiate between what is important and what isn't"
98167,The assignments/psets were confusing and we didn't learn them in class.
98167,Aleh is a good lecturer and the peer tutors were really helpful (especially great). The course coordinator is very quick to answer questions as well
98167,"Tsyvinski is an entertaining lecturer, so he can often make macroeconomics (sometimes a really boring subject) into something easier to listen to, so its not less difficult to grasp material. Its one of the courses biggest strengths.   In my opinion the biggest weakness about this class is that there is so much material and even with the 1 page summaries they do provide its not always obvious what is actually necessary to know just as people studying economics, and what is going to be tested."
98167,The course was extremely well structured and easy to follow. The number of resources available made me feel extremely supported throughout the entire thing.
98167,I think that there is a ton of help if needed but the weakness would be that it is hard to focus in the lectures at times.
98167,Very well organized.
98167,"It covers a broad range of topics, but in order to do so, it goes very quickly. Most of the material ends up forgotten or not tested because there is just so much in each lecture. I feel like giving greater emphasis to the main points might be a way to improve."
98167,"The course provides a lot of information and extra insight to those who can put the time into it. Professor Hawkinss commitment to aiding the course was very helpful. 116 gives the bases to understand much of what is said in media as well as provides the bases for further study in economics. It is however not always clear what is testable, and what are the takeaways that we should take from certain expositions (not because theyre useless but because they have a lot going on)."
98167,"This course had strengths in providing ample information on topics, but a weakness was organization of slides and applications of formulas to certain topics"
98167,"There is a lot of interesting material, and the lectures are pretty engaging, though maybe could have been organized better."
98167,Weaknesses- it went too fast and most learning happened outside the class Strengths- professor is nice
98167,Well organized. Wish the lecture recordings were available.
98167,The methodical way in which it is organised is a big strength. A weakness is that some lectures were challenging to follow at the time and I could only understand them after reviewing the material.
98167,Strengths the professor is engaging Weaknesses content review is unorganized and TAs are not always accurate
98167,Strengths of the course were that it was well-organized and there were many resources available to students for studying and reviewing the material outside of lectures. A weakness of the course was that lecture recordings were not made available to us until the very end of the semester for reading period.
98167,Grading requirements clearer
98167,"Strengths: Office hours, peer tutoring, and general lectures were all accessible and all very helpful.  Weaknesses: N/A"
98167,There is absolutely no Instruction or teaching in lecture; I felt like I wasn't being tought
98167,"This course did a great job of providing immense resources to study and review the material even after lecture (which were very well done in it of themselves). The calendar provided every time and place for office hours and discussion sections, and there were many options every week, so you would always make it to the sessions you needed to no matter how busy your schedule was. There was also lecture summaries alongside each slideshow that were great for reviewing before the final, which required us going through a lot of material. There were also review sessions before each exam, with the sessions before the final each focusing on each third of the semester. Additionally, the ED discussion board was a useful way to ask quick question and get clarification on the off chance I couldn't make an office hours. The only thing that stood out to me that could be improved upon was discussing exam questions with TFs and possibly getting points back. I felt that for both exams, some questions had vague or misleading wording, which did not fully encapsulate what the question was asking. Looking back afterwards, a couple of questions seemed to expect too much given the instructions."
98167,Strengths: It is very organized with many office hours and a clear understanding of what you are expected to know. Homework is not too overwhelming with it really only being psets/worksheets.
98167,"Strengths is the course organization. A clear weakness is the fact that the professor basically just reads the slides, which makes the class not engaging."
98167,"I think the course is good in being split by two professors and having discussion sections and well split topics, but the timing of midterms was a bit odd to me (being frontloaded made studying for the final surprisingly more overwhelming)."
98167,"- weaknesses: Did not have access to online vidoes until end of course, psets were sometimes random - strengths: now I understand the news and understand how our central banking system wors"
98167,"The course is very well organized and there are many helpful resources that can assist in helping absorb the material like peer tutors and office hours.  The only weakness is that it is so much class content and the lectures I felt like could be a bit more engaging, but it was definitely manageable."
98167,"I think that its difficult for the prof who teaches the glass is so different from the prof that writes the tests and sets the grades, bc the one who sets the grades dr.hawkins is so mathy and not very good at understanding or explaining why wed be struggling on a topic or explaining to us in a way that wasnt really mathy and didnt honestly leave me more confused than before. I think things for me on the midterm wouldve been better for me is if the ppl who teach the class also have the hw ajd the exams written in the same way/style they teach it, so like tyvinski i think he really enjoys the history parts of economics but hed go into such specifics itd be hard to know which were the important facts to remember and if you were just unlucky to remember on exam day you lose maybe a 2 point mc question which is a lot in exams out of 50 pts. I dont like also how they have multiple choice and true/false its just a laziness on the part of the professor prioritizing whats the easiest format for me regardless of whether this negatively impacts students performance. I know for my two midterms i got nearly perfect on the long/short answer question but on the true or falae section and definitleh the mc section i got points off that added to a lot that were bc of misreading the question bc im going fast but unlike long/short answers you cant get partial credit on a mc choice or true/false its either all points or no points and that isnt right. They didnt have practically any zoom tf/pt sessions/office hours which i think wouldve been better for some. You learn a shitttt ton of content and we got no calculators and no formula sheets even when there are so so many formulas and theories you absolutrly must inow exactly write or you could misanswer a potential exam qurstion, even though in almost all past years in this class calculators and formula sheets were offered or it being open book/open note. I just dont get it this policy doesnt reflect the real world at all where we arent isolated with only our knowledge; we have the internet our opinions calculators our notes when we need to make decisisions based on economic principles. Again i think this is just lazy exam and grading style by the prof because open note and calculator exams have to have questions that are more theoretical or are apllicance based and are not just replicas of a past exam problem where the student couldve aready found a past answer key you have to devote more time and it is harder to write these exams and grade them bc the graders really have to consider each point each student makes. The information and examples on the lectures would always feel so much simpler than what was put on the exams"
98167,"This course must be one of the most well-organized and structured courses at Yale. Students were able to ask question in an anonymous manner, and received clear and concise feedback on each PSET. Lectures were equally engaging and organized."
98167,I sometimes found the problem sets to be inaccessible without office hours help.
98167,"Lecture pacing is often hard to keep up with, but the support which surrounds the course is phenomenal"
98167,"The strengths of this course are the resources beyond lecture to support students in learning. The Ed discussion forum, office hours, peer tutoring, section, one-page summaries, and additional practice exams all served as great ways to understand what is often glossed over in lecture. I also appreciated the use of the worksheets as a low-stakes way to apply the knowledge from lectures. However, the lectures contained too much content that was not fully explained, or explained too quickly. There were also not enough opportunities to work through examples directly on the slideshow or during lecture. I also wish students would have been able to ask more questions during lecture."
98167,"Strengths: covers interesting material, sections are helpful Weaknesses: not engaging"
98167,"Automated Gradescope, lecture summaries, sections, review sessions are all excellent"
98167,Professor Tsyvinski is awesome and keeps his students engaged
98167,Strengths: Dr. Hawkins was a fabulous course director and the course was very well organized. The TFs were also wonderful and great at explaining things. Professor Tsyvinski was funny and engaging. Weaknesses: sometimes the lectures felt a little long for the amount of content they covered
98167,I studied very well on my own but didn't enjoy lecture very much
98167,"I thought that one of the strengths of this course is that although a lot of information is being thrown at you, it really forces you to learn a lot in a short period of time. I went from knowing practically nothing about the macroeconomy (except for perhaps some information I had learned about macro during introductory micro in the fall) to having a pretty solid fundamental understanding. I thought that one of the weaknesses of this course is that due to the fact that there is so much information, I had a hard time really learning much of it right away during lecture, which could at times make things rather confusing. However, I tended to be able to learn the material on my own when I went back to the lecture slides after class and with the help of discussion section and TA office hours."
98167,"moves ver yfast and the lectures were kind of hard to follow, so it took a lot of outside time to understand the material"
98167,"the strengths was the clarity in the synthesis of class material, but I wished there were more detailed explanation on the slides to review/ more diagrams."
98167,Overall great material
98167,"The course was well structured, especially with the cutoff on information used on each exam."
98167,The lectures were not very helpful and the course director was much better at teaching the material. I also thought the problem sets were very different from the exam questions. The lecture slides were also very long.
98167,Lectures could be a bit shorter or more narrowly focused.
98167,"A weakness is that the professor just read the lecture slides which made lectures not important to attend. He also did not make the important things clear until after the lecture was over, so it was hard to follow."
98186,It was the hardest class I've ever taken.
98186,"The course had every-other-week problem sets, but I would have preferred shorter problem sets every week that could reinforce class material more directly. The quizzes were extremely difficult and did not reflect lecture material, even while being open-note."
98186,"Lecture moved a bit slowly and the concepts were very jumbled around. The order of the slides was sometimes not logical and too many case studies were thrown in before I had actually grasped the basic theory behind what we were doing. Also, it sometimes felt like the professor went through the hard stuff really quickly and the easy stuff too slowly. However, section was incredibly useful and concretely took us through that basic theory. I think that if lecture just went through the no-extra-fluff version of what we had to know first and then complimented it with examples, that would be much better."
98186,"R? U kidding me? How are we supposed to learn R in one homework assignment? Not possible. Would like to see the data analytics on the success of that plan. Unfortunately I still don't know how to code so that wouldn't be possible for me, but I imagine its low."
98186,"the lecture is not very helpful in understanding the content, and many mistakes were made in presentations that were only corrected when a student pointed out their confusion."
98186,Good
98186,"This course does a lot in one semester: probability, theory of statistics, and coding. Some more office hours towards the beginning of the semester to help those who have no background in statistics and probability would be helpful."
98186,"The sections for this course were very helpful. I think the course was well-laid out: moving from probability rules to determining causality. The course moved a little fast, and the quizzes (meant to help student learning) were very difficult. The quizzes in particular could be improved."
98186,"The strengths of this course are how the content is very thought-provoking and how the real-life applications help to make the content more understandable. The weaknesses are that the lectures are often filled with fluff content, and there isn't enough time spent going over R."
98186,The course was structured to facilitate student learning. Office hours were very accessible but problem set errors were not revealed.
98186,"Very dense and exams are very hard. Would be better with no time pressure on the exams, and finding a way to make content more engaging."
98186,necessary information for a thesis
98186,Terribly designed course; you have to do lots of the learning on your own
98186,long lectures not very well explained and difficult to understand what was going on
98186,the project timeline is too rush
98186,"Strengths - the psets used real world data for the coding portions, and the TFs were great at leading sections  Weaknesses - the lectures were quite slow-paced. There were not enough real-world examples/applications of concepts in lecture, so oftentimes the problem sets would be more confusing than my other classes'."
98186,"strengths: section and office hours were imperative to learning the material (Josh Leffler is an unbelievable TA and definitely did not make enough $ for the work he put in to help so many students)  weaknesses: lecture so hard to follow, not engaging at all, most students stopped showing up because it was a waste of time (can't follow any of the material at all), material not presented clearly, past students of ECON 117 expressed confusion when looking at some of the material we were learning as they had seen some of it in intermediate/advanced level classes (not intro), if you didn't know how to code in R before this class you were severely disadvantaged as there was no instruction at all"
98186,"Strength: Good TA's, Good Peer Tutors  Weaknesses: Lackluster instruction."
98186,Strengths: Topics were really cool Weaknesses: Very low engagement. I essentially taught the course to myself whenever I had to review for the exam. That's when I realized the topics were pretty cool.
98186,The course is that it teaches econometrics and examples of real-world application of it.
98186,"The course was organized well and the problem sets definitely helped to facilitate learning. The lectures were a little bit long-winded at times and it seemed like sometimes the topics being discussed weren't relevant or important to the course content that was on the PSETs or exams. The course could be improved by making lectures more clear and concise in the presentation of the content, leaving more time and room for putting what we learn into practice."
98186,The course content was very interesting and Prof. Altonji makes the lectures funny. He is also very kind.
98186,"Strengths: Exams were appropriate difficulty level and class is curved well. Weaknesses: P-Sets are very very long and difficult, poor quality lectures."
98186,The content is pretty interesting but i didn't think it was always presented in the most compelling way
98186,Exams were a bit challenging and the content itself was hard but adequate resources were provided
98186,The course covers a lot of important content and is pretty fair. I think professor Altonji could have been more engaging.
98186,"The problem sets weren't too bad and the peer tutors and TFs were very helpful. Lectures were quite long and a little dry (the lectures were recorded, though, which was good). Exams were challenging, but manageable."
98186,Professor's teaching should become more lively and for it to be more engaging and effective.
98186,"The course material was made more confusing than it needed to be, but there were many examples and real world applications which were helpful."
98186,Not very well structured and not enough teaching regarding coding. We had to self teach a lot for R.
98186,"Professor Altonji is certainly great at econometrics, but is not the greatest at teaching it. Sections are helpful, good notes, psets are good practice problems and the R isn't the most difficult. Each pset (we had 7) were on two week deadlines which was helpful, just pace yourself and you will do good on those. Exams are certainly difficult. Professor teaching is what wasn't pleasant, and midterm exam is very short time for many problems, might not finish."
98186,"Strengths: good knowledge and information about R, good empirical examples  Weaknesses: lecture slides were extremely exhaustive and long, about 80-90 pages, so it was very difficult to review and retain information, could improve by making the information more concise and summarizing the examples provided."
98186,Horrible lecture formats - learned very little from them
98186,Lectures could be improved.
98186,"Strengths: great examples with real world relevance for every new concept introduced in the course; clearly structured outline at the start of each lecture, with lecture outline conveniently placed on top of slides Weakness: course slides are glitchy sometimes; mistakes in the slides are usually not corrected until the professor realizes them in class; didn't get to learn a lot of R"
98186,Not explained very well
98186,The PSETs are engaging and require you to understand the content of the class. They helped me think about the practical applications of the course content as well.
98186,"The course content is overall well-organized, with a clear breakdown of topics and a logical progression between topics with one concept building upon another. However, I wish we could receive more systematic guidance and practice on R. By the end of the semester, I learned certain commands and knew how to answer questions on the psets, but I still dont feel confident to say I know how to code in R. I also hope the teaching team could double check before they release the psets questions there were several errors in more than one pset which caused some confusion and needed updates. Although I know it is hard given limited time and resources, but it would also be very helpful if the teaching team could return graded psets indicating where we did wrong exactly."
98186,this course was not taught at what i believe is an introductory level. the concepts were not thouroughly explained and there were not enough example problems or applications that were straightforward and mimicked exam formats
98186,"The course is necessary for the major, but besides that, there are no reasons to take this class. The lectures were not organized well to facilitate learning. I learned barely anything in lecture, and often found it was more productive to teach myself than to try to figure out what was going on. The problem sets were too long, and they made very little sense, to the point that oftentimes the teaching assistants at office hours didn't know how to solve them. R was a major part of the course, but the professor didn't even know how to use R, so he DEFINITELY didn't know how to teach R, so nobody learned R properly."
98186,I think quizzes were very helpful for solidifying materials and the slides were well constructed. The lecture was not very engaging and led to most students not showing up.
98186,"Strengths: applicability Weaknesses: Chan be boring at times, no feedback on problem sets"
98186,More stuff on different models
98186,"I really liked how our problem sets led us to reproduce results from various econometric research papers, and I think the course teaches important concepts. Sometimes I feel I did not get a lot out of attending lectures, though, especially because attendance was generally quite low."
98186,"I thought that the comprehensive nature of the class was good, especially for someone who has never really taken a stats class before and doesn't really plan on doing so again in the future. Beyond that, though, the class was terribly weak. Far too much time was spent looking at real world examples while far too little time was spent developing intuition behind the actual methods that we were learning. And while it's certainly nice to see how the work you're doing can be applied in the real world, it's not particularly engaging when the class is as boring as this one is. I also thought that the lack of assistance with the R. programming language was a massive barrier to success in this class. There was virtually no help with it in lecture, making it feel at times that we were in two different classes and completely missing one of them. And this wouldn't have been so bad except that the problem sets relied heavily on R. This isn't to mention that Professor Altonji wasn't particularly well-versed in R himself, putting us into a dumb-leading-the-blind situation. The other stark weakness I found was the final exam. It placed far too much emphasis on things that were never explicitly discussed. And while every class at Yale is meant to be difficult insofar as that success requires, at least to some extent, that the student spend time really getting to understand the material and the intuition behind it, such parts are usually only a marginal portion of exams which are instead intended to assess students on the more concrete with a few of those more difficult questions sprinkled in. The final was nearly the complete opposite. I wouldn't have thought it such a kick in the head, but none of the previous finals were remotely that difficult and were frankly a terrible means of preparation because the exam was ridiculous and so out of line with anything that is normally taught in the class or expected of its students. I don't know that there was any reasonable way of preparing for that exam, especially in the midst of worrying about 3 to 4 other finals. There's so much more that could be said about the shortcomings of this class, but it's not worth my time. This class was a joke, a cruel and fucked up joke."
98186,I believe it could be more engaging and interactive. The peer tutors were the best part of the class. They helped a ton. The professor was very nice but just read off the slides during lecture. I feel as though I wasnt really being taught at all. Especially I think the r coding could have been taught better
98186,"This class was truly horrible, by far the worst I've taken in the Econ department. However, on the one hand, the skills and material are interesting and undoubtedly valuable (I'm certainly utilizing these skills in other classes, research, and in life). On the other hand, the lectures were unbelievably dull and hard to follow, and the course itself suffered from deep disorganization; P-sets, sections, and exams were very disconnected to the lectures, teaching fellows had no idea what was going on in lecture, and there were all sorts of assumptions of prior knowledge. Content wise, the class is extremely important for any econ major, but there must be a better teaching team. This nightmare was the fault of the professor and the lack of coordination between TFs and professor.  It is important context for the reader of this feedback to know that I am a student that performed very well on both the midterm and final, so this feedback is not in any way my anger for getting a poor grade. I give this feedback out of a sincere hope that the Econ Department will fix the nightmare that was Econ 117 this semester so future students can have a better learning experience."
98186,Strengths: The material covered was interesting and relevant  Weaknesses: The class was overall disorganized
98186,"Very bad course. Material is poorly taught, assignments are unhelpful, and overall there was no cohesive set of ideas to the course. This is a class to truly avoid at all costs."
98186,"This course was taught in a confusing manner, I would make class examples simpler"
98186,The class was well organized. The teach assistants were helpful in organizing their sections and provided useful information on R and data analysis in general every sections. The lectures were not very good and it made it hard for me to get content from them. I didn't go to class that often as a result
98186,This course was not very engaging. Lectures dragged on and did not relate well to problem sets. Instruction on R code was also limited.
98186,Professor Altonji didnt teach much just read the slides off during lectures.
98186,"Strengths: The content in the course is highly applicable in the data-driven world, which empowers advances.  Weaknesses: The content was presented poorly so it didn't excite students and was difficult to learn. The professor is terrible and tends to attract less than 1/5 of the class for each lecture, leaving the students to learn entirely on their own."
98186,"Strengths: Techniques learned are likely to prove useful in research, peer tutors like Annie and Josh were enormously helpful, Crossan the TA was awesome!  Weaknesses: Most TAs dont really want to be helpful, Professor Altonji, though an accomplished researcher, was not a great professor, there was a conspicuous lack of transparency regarding grading, and it seem to be that we often were left to our devices when trying to learn material for this courses. When my peers complained about bad testing conditions and suffering from nausea in one of the testing rooms, the ED Discussion was restricted to prevent the feed from exploding with responses."
98186,"Discussion sections were rather repetitive of lecture content and lectures, especially with introductory concepts, were rather slow. I enjoyed the difficulty of quizzes and tests, however that level was not matched by other parts of the course."
98186,Strengths are interesting content. Weaknesses are somewhat unengaging lectures.
98186,Professor was a bit confusing.
98186,"Each lecture was just ridiculously boringand I am usually never critical about a class I have taken at Yale. A lot of the concepts/ideas just didn't connect with each other, and the lectures were not helpful in providing a good foundational understanding."
98186,"Strengths included clear and engaging lecture slides, relevant and interesting problem sets, and the abundance of support from the professor, TFs, and peer tutors. I really enjoyed all of the real-world applications throughout the course. A weakness of the course was the lack of off-slide teaching during lecturesI wouldve appreciated more clarifications and explanations that were not written on the board."
98186,I think the assessment requirements were communicated well and that it was clear what material needed to be understood in order to complete the assignments. There was a nice sense of progression as new content built on top of previous material. Perhaps conveying this more clearly earlier in the course may be good for students to get a clear sense of the bigger picture of what the course is building up towards.
98186,"Strengths: You will learn a lot; the slides are useful for review, and the PSETs are helpful. Office hours/peer tutoring hours are great.  Weaknesses: None really; I would caution students to make sure they keep engaged and not fall behind."
98186,"Strength: well structured, good professor Weaknesses: n/a"
98186,"The course did provide a pretty detailed look at many concepts within data analysis and economic research. However, there were several flaws within the course. Problem sets were made by different TFs each week, so the structure and level of difficulty was always changing, making time management much more difficult. The material in quizzes was often not covered well in class or in section. In addition, not nearly enough attention was devoted to teaching R. Although discussion sections covered examples using R, the 50-minute time constraint made TFs present the information so fast that it was difficult to follow. TFs in office hours would sometimes refer individuals to a lecture rather than explain and answer the questions themselves."
98186,Lectures have to be better prepared and more engaging.
98186,An intro course to the ECON major and a prereq should be taught by an engaging professor. Prof. Altonji was very nice but he drove me away from lecture with his lack of energy.
98186,"I am an Economics major, and one thing that I love about the Econ department is that they have wonderful introduction courses. However, I am sad to say this class did not meet the standard I am used to from the Yale Econ department. Some strengths were that the lecture slides were easy to follow, and some of the peer tutors (particularly Josh) were very helpful. I also liked the quizzes for practicing the material, and it was nice to have tests take up a lower grade percentage than some of my other classes. However, there was lots of room for improvement. First, Professor Altonji's lectures lacked the engaging, easy-to-follow nature of other Econ courses, and the number of technical difficulties we had in class really disturbed my ability to learn. Way too much time was spent on the minutia of random economics papers, and I often left the class with no understanding of the actual topic of the day since it was not focused on for most of the lecture. Additionally, lectures often had long pauses or the professor would make mistakes, which is understandable but after a while really hurt my ability to learn the material. Also, if a goal of this class is to teach you how to code in R, there was not enough support for learning R code at all. I had no previous coding experience but was taking another class where I was learning R this semester, so I could get through. However, if I did not have that other class, I would have been very lost. This class needs to spend more time on R basic so students understand what they are doing versus just copying over code every problem set."
98186,"Look. Professor Altonji is so sweet and nice that I hate to say this, but he is a not awesome at lecturing. (That's okay! Not everyone is!) It was really hard to pay attention, so I stopped going to class, and that was a fundamental problem. Frankly, the best teachers in the course weren't even the TFs, they was the peer tutors (specifically Josh Leffler, who should be the one teaching the class). As someone who has taken 5 Econ lectures at Yale--only one of which was well taught--I WISH the Econ department would stop employing faculty who are (I assume) good researchers but are terrible at the teaching roles they've been given. Just get some people who are good at presenting concepts clearly and make them teach the lectures. I genuinely could not care less if they have had a paper published or not. I think Professor Altonji would be a great professor for an upper level seminar where the students are more on his page. This class should not be for him."
98197,good
98197,"Strengths: clear slides, review, and prof Frick is great at taking the time to make sure we understand difficult topics"
98197,"I think the course is taught really well, I just wish that the lectures were a little more engaging and that the midterm and final were not weighted so heavily."
98197,"Good lecture style, sections often very helpful."
98197,"Prof. Frick and the class being recorded are the main strengths. Sitting in lecture can be dull but if you concentrate on what Frick says and her slides, they are actually very clear/ thorough (hence, why being able to watch the recordings are crucial). Also, her exams are very fair and not trying to trick students. The TFs were terrible but that's the case with most ECON courses."
98197,Not much feedback on psets but well organized material
98197,solid
98197,"Strengths: interesting content, taught clear and concise Weaknesses: low engagement"
98197,"This class had so many resources. There were probably at least a dozen office hours per week and over 40 hours of office hours during reading week (and this is off-cycle!). The lecture slides were incredibly organized and easy to follow during and outside of class. ECON 121 is also by far one of the most well-organized and well-structured courses Ive taken as it starts by focusing on consumers; then focusing on producers; and then additional topics, and does so in a way where the knowledge points become naturally cumulative; everything builds upon each other very nicely, which also makes learning new ideas less complicated. The only weakness is that for people who grasp onto the content easily, this may end up feeling like a course that teaches you a few optimization techniques and then applying them in different flavors, in turn feeling like the content has little variety."
98197,The course was taught at a good pace but it is very dependent (meaning that you will get out of the course what you put into it).
98197,"Strengths: lectures were concise and easy to comprehend, information was taught in a perfect order, and this course was brilliantly planned by Professor Frick."
98197,"Professor Frick is phenomenal. Taking core ECON classes with any prof. at Yale is usually the same experience; you dont gain or lose much depending on the prof. That is not true here. You gain a lot by having Prof. Frick, even though the content is standard (given its a core class)."
98197,"Strengths: useful content Weaknesses: low student engagement, especially throughout the semester."
98197,Very well structured and organized. No real qualms.
98197,"The professor certainly help, Frick knows how to teach. The lectures are also not overwhelming, it is new information, you must learn it how anybody learsn anything, but in each lecture there is leeway for it to be covered in the next one, she does not burden you with unnecessary math. There are plenty office hours, the psets are 2 week deadlines. And each problem tells you where you can find the topic (lecture). The math also isn't pointless, you truly learn about optimal decisions and the comparative statics. And exams are - ill say peaceful - there are not unnecessary curve balls or surprise topics, it is what you learn and the process is familiar from the psets. Course is designed well, and the math is taught to anyone who hates math."
98197,"Mira is incredible at teaching, and is absolutely a strength of the course. The slides psets and exams are all also very well made."
98197,"Professor Frick is an incredible teacher. She teaches so clearly, and engages with students wonderfully. I wish I hadn't skipped so many in-person lectures, but the ones that I did attend in person were great."
98197,"Strengths: I think this course is very variable in terms of benefits, many of which depends on the professor teaching (I took this course briefly last semester until the midterm, and believe the professor is really important in the experience see below). Given that, a course-wide strength is the non-weekly problem sets, instead giving longer tests every few weeks to bring together different concepts. I also benefited greatly from the TA sessions right after the lesson on Wednesday to recap the concepts covered during that week the TA slides were very efficiently organized."
98197,"This is a hard class. The lectures are boilerplate, the slides are dense, and the math is applied in funky ways. Once you understand the structure, it is a matter of applying concepts to problems in a repetitive way."
98197,"STRENGTHS: amazing professor, good workload, everything is great, TFs are super helpful and know their stuff, lots of support in discussion sections and also you can ask questions anonymously through Ed Discussion and the professor and TFs are very responsive and give detailed answers // WEAKNESSES: none, take this course with Prof Mira Frick and you will be set"
98197,"Strengths: Professor Frick and our TA Helena. Mira is the sweetest professor ever, and Helena was super helpful. Weaknesses: the rest of the course. Econ 121 was easily the most boring course I've taken. To be clear, this is not the fault of the teaching staff--the material is just so boring!"
98197,I really liked how Prof Frick taught the course!
98197,"I think that the accessibility to office hours and help is very high, but I dislike the grading policy with homework and in particular exams. There is no room for discussion on the grading of the exam, which I believe prevents students from being able to discuss and fully understand why certain points are docked."
98197,"I wish these classes would write out problems on the board during lectures instead of relying solely on slides. It is much easier to take notes and retain something when the professor has to slow down enough to walk through it themselves, and it is helpful to see the math done rather than omitted for speed."
98197,"Weakness: if you are not good at math, this is going to take a lot of effort. Nonetheless, this was a wonderful course."
98197,"The professor was great, lectures were well organized, but the sections weren't very engaging."
98197,"This course was extremely well-structured! Unlike other economics classes, I didn't have a hard time following along the course and the progression (and connection) of ideas."
98197,It was extremely hard to follow lectures. The material was dry and read directly from the slides. The only strength is that it covers a lot of material.
98197,The strength of this course is that it provides you with the tools and knowledge needed to use mathematical concepts to analyze modern economic concepts.
98197,"The course should not be recorded or at least the recording should be sent with the permission of the instructor. It was very easy to skip class and watch the recording later, which did not really fulfill my academic experience with this class."
98197,"Strengths: course is very well organized, slides are SUPER clear and well done and they definitely facilitate learning. peer tutors were good.  Weaknesses: psets were sometimes sooooo long and had boring algebra calculations that made them 28 pages long without reason. Professor is clear but basically reads the slides and is quite boring. nothing exciting about her or the class. I ended up watching the lectures at home on 2 times speed TA's are awkward but peer tutors are great"
98197,The organization of the material and sections was strong. Lectures greatly followed slides.
98197,The strength is that it's required. The weakness is everything beyond.
98197,This course could be improved with more examples in lecture and better practice problems that are applicable to the professors teaching style.
98197,Very well organized and exams were fair. Also interesting content.
98197,"Mira Frick was great, I would not change the course."
98197,"I think the course was strong! My only feedback would be that I would've appreciated more questions (in homeworks, etc.) that helped link up the math to the intuition behind it."
98197,"Strengths: Well-organized, problem sets and discussion section materials reinforce class concepts, many office hours and support  Weaknesses: Lectures feature a lot of proofs and math and go too quickly to understand the logic behind the math, and too slowly if you choose to learn the math later and focus on the overall concepts in the moment."
98197,"Weaknesses: Can be overly involved in the math and not spend enough time on actual material. This class turned too much into a calculus class at times, and instead spend roe time diving into the interesting topics that arise later in the course, such as game theory or uncertainty."
98197,This course was extremely strong in explaining the concepts thoroughly and had very few weaknesses.
98197,"The course was really well formatted. The lecture slides, discussion section problems & explanations, and previous homework explanations all being posted on Canvas was super helpful if we ever wanted to look back on previous material while completing the homework or studying for exams. Additionally, there was an abundance of office hours."
98197,Incredibly organized and well taught
98197,the course is very well structured
98197,slides were way to dense and concepts were gone over way too quickly
98197,Lectures were informative
98197,"It was extremely well organized, with all lecture notes and recordings posted promptly, final exam contents very well-defined, and homework assignments very standardized and on a consistent schedule. The only weakness that I can think of is that the contents of this course are extremely similar to the contents of introductory microeconomics courses (ECON 115 and ECON 110), with just a little more mathematical rigor. I took ECON 110 last year, so I found some of the content to be a little bit repetitive, and would probably just have taken ECON 120 without ECON 110 if I could go back."
98197,Interesting frameworks.
98208,"The course is very interesting and engaging, and Professor Ilse puts a lot of effort in the lectures, but the course sometimes progresses too fast, so you have review the material on your own after class, otherwise you cannot build upon the material of past lectures and you start getting confused."
98208,Disorganized lecture slides and some topics are unclear
98208,"The abundance of Office Hour slots was greatly appreciated. There was an enormous amount of exterior support (EdBoard, OH, the professor and teaching fellows making themselves available, practice exams, etc). The lectures were clear and to the point. The PSETs were fair assessments of what was covered in class."
98208,Great lectures
98208,The lectures were very well organized and the slides made all of the concepts clear. The TAs were good at making the sections engaging and helpful by working through actual example problems.
98208,"The strengths of this course included the hands-on use of Excel in problem sets and the applications of economic theory to real-world situations. Additionally, while the derivations of some models seemed long, the conclusions helped me understand the material further. The midterm exam was difficult, but it was graded fairly leniently in my opinion, which helped."
98208,"Strengths:  1. Tackles difficult concepts through repetition. 2. Well-structured slides and lectures that are always posted.  3. Problem sets are helpful (and fun sometimes)!  Weaknesses:  1. I didn't like the order of the course -- starting with the hardest material was brutal. 2. Sometimes lectures get pretty monotonous. 3. I'm gonna be real, I think almost no one reads the textbook. Just worth taking into account. 4. Pset grading was weird -- sometimes it was for accuracy, sometimes for effort. I worked with friends on some of the psets and occasionally got graded differently for problems we did the same way, and I get the impression grading is pretty inconsistent."
98208,The lectures were great and beneficial. Problem Sets were not very beneficial to learning. It could be improved by implementing a new form of assessment and finding better ways for students to engage with the material.
98208,I believe the professor provided the content in a transparent manner.
98208,Through on review and focus on making sure students understand course material
98208,"Strengths: Very well organized, slides are clear and informative, sections are clear and helpful. If you like econ, this should not be an especially difficult course. It is curved to a B+/A- so even a slightly above average student can get an A-. Eight problem sets is a fair amount, and TFs and peer tutors are very helpful. Weaknesses: Even for people who like economics, this isn't an especially fun class. It's a cut and dry intermediate macro course. No surprises and nothing exciting. The course is adapted to the professor's teaching style, but almost all the material is textbook macro material."
98208,I think that a strength is the applications we learned in the real world.
98208,"interesting materials and the exams were very reasonable however, the P sets could have a bit better and more relevant questions"
98208,"Strengths:  -Exams fair  -ED Discussion tool -Instructor did a great job pacing out assignments PSETs were manageable (due on Saturdays at 10pm after everyone had a chance to go to section and one break week built in)  -Enjoyed when lecture content was connected to real-world examples   How to be improved:  -Make sections more active learning (such as econ demonstrations, games, experiments, etc.) to foster a deeper understanding of the topic taught that week as opposed to just a repeat of only the lecture style."
98208,"It was clear that lectures were very organized as professor Lindenlaub was able to fit as much content as possible while always finishing class in around 75 minutes. I appreciated that a lot of time was spent discussing the applications of course content in economic history and our current economy as students were able to understand the relevance of the material we had learned. Furthermore, I particularly appreciated the use of Excel in problem sets as Excel is also a great life skill that helps with many jobs and making graphs via Excel really illuminated the real-life application-based nature of this course. That said, because lectures were made to fit as much content as possible in 75 minutes, they occasionally went a bit too fast, and without lecture recordings, it was difficult to clear up confusion without needing to attend office hours. I do also wish there were more resources for this course, as this is one of Yale's largest lectures, yet there are significantly fewer office hours compared to some of my other lecture courses. The professor's office hours were also on Monday morning, which made it difficult for students to attend."
98208,"This course was fine. If you're an Econ major, it's not bad, though it can be difficult to remain engaged during the lectures. The lecture slides are generally very good though."
98208,The course content (especially in the second half) was very relevant and interesting. The teaching was also very clear and easy to follow.
98208,"I think the teacher covered concepts clearly, made sure to approach the big picture and applications with thorough care. I think the course may have been a little slower paced in the second half but it made up for it in the applicability and interesting nature of the concepts."
98208,Strengths - well-organized. The professor was very fair. Helpful practice exams and the exams reflected what she said was important/emphasized. Weaknesses - wasn't recorded. Sometimes lecture slides were a bit confusing.
98208,"Just writing this evaluation to say Ilse Lindenlaub is an absolute gem of a teacher! She's engaging, clear, thorough, and was an absolute pleasure to have as a professor."
98208,"Strengths: The greatest strength of this class is Professor Lindenlaub who makes the material accessible and engaging. The class is incredibly well-structured with slides and section notes available on canvas, frequent office hours and sections, and practice exam material that reflects the level of understanding necessary for the exams. Weaknesses: at the beginning of the class, Professor Lindenlaub took the time to work out derivations during class. This was very helpful, and it would be nice to do this more often."
98208,"I liked this class. The content was interesting and the applications very relevant. Lindenlaub is a great professor and her slides were good. While there is a lot of content, section resources and the course organization in general made it easy to find answers quickly."
98208,"Strengths: Prof. Lindenlaub is an engaging lecturer, and her slides are excellent. Weaknesses: there was too much of a focus on deriving models, and problem sets were too long."
98208,"Great professor, who chose interesting topics and could teach the material well. Great section material that helped students understand the course content and let them practice problems."
98208,"The professor did a great job of adapting to student feedback. As she did this, more applications were introduced and the course became interesting on another level."
98208,"Strengths - content is interesting, especially the case studies and historical examples. PSETs and section were generally helpful in understanding the material, and preparing for exams. Organization was strong, and PSETs/exams are graded impressively fast. Textbook is also super helpful if you read it. Weaknesses - PSETs ran a little long sometimes. Some concepts are covered fairly broadly (still a survey course, so understandable). You are likely to have seen some of this material before at the intro level."
98208,"Professor was weakness, and the explanation of the math was poor. We could derive at some point a workable intuition - but self taught methods - profs methods and lecture slides are not intuitive."
98208,"Strength: extremely organized! Prof. Lindenlaub is a great lecturer and you can tell she spends time organizing the course and making sure that the lectures are reflective of what she will test us on. Weakness: this is a relative weakness, but worthwhile mentioning: there is a lot of math in this course! especially in the second half. The professor and the TA's are always there to answer questions and for guidance, but please keep this in mind. You might need to review calc and partial derivatives beforehand if you are not comfortable with them."
98208,"I think the course is far too theoretical and the models don't really work. However, I did appreciate the increased use of data and real-world application in the second half of the term (potentially due to my fiery mid-term feedback)."
98208,There could be more opportunities to engage with other students throughout the class and work on projects involving modern-day phenomena.
98208,Overall this was a very strong course that was taught very well and was very organized. One of the better run classes I have taken at Yale.
98208,This course spends too long delving into models when frankly its students need a robust understanding of modern Economic policy. The TAs did a great job of grading assignments quickly.
98208,"The course is very well organized and the slides are easy to follow. Ilse has a very clear lecturing style, which is helpful since the course can be somewhat challenging. No weaknesses I can think of."
98208,"Strengths: it is clear what is being evaluated, professors and TAs who are engaged and want to help; Weaknesses: Psets are sometimes excessively long and difficult, explanations can be a little unclear, and the nature of the material can be questionable in its application at times"
98208,"Strength: very clearly organized class structure, great lecturing skills from Professor Lindenlaub, thorough inspection of diverse models in macroeconomics Weakness: the class is high-pace and there are quite a lof of assumptions for the models"
98208,No recorded lectures makes it hard for a course with such technical work
98208,"Great course, great lecturer, and very interesting in my opinion. Strong class."
98208,I think that the strengths were the organization of the course and how it was structured on the syllabus. It was very easy to follow certain topics and
98208,I think the course was well organized and a strength was having a brief overview of previous lectures at the beginning of each class and the Professor going through some or the derivations in class on the white board.
98208,"Strengths: Lindenlaub is a great lecturer, TF were very responsive on Ed Discussion, overall organization and communication were good, practice midterm and final were very helpful for the real exams. Weaknesses: content was too focused on math and ""modeling"" economics instead of applications"
98208,"Strengths: lots of office hours, relevant applications of macroeconomics to banking/pandemic/recession, etc. Weaknesses: lectures moved quickly, problem sets tested algebraic, rather than conceptual knowledge, no recordings made it hard to review at times, problem sets were arduous, rather than being conceptually challenging. Lack of clarity as to significance of models (each model that we learned in depth seemed to be unsupported, at some level, by data we were also reviewing in class)"
98208,"Strengths: lectures are very clear (even though it gets fairly mathy at some points), and the TA sections are helpful if you don't keep up with all of the complex models during the lecture. Office hours are helpful for completing p-sets. Exams accurately reflect course content, with a good balance of mathematical modeling and practical intuition/application. Weaknesses: p-sets can sometimes be unclear or difficult to complete without further explanation."
98208,"Not recording lectures and poor slides put students at an extreme disadvantage to learn because professor has too much pride in that they want students to come to class. Instead, maybe consider that being able to rewatch lecture actually helps students learn. So frustrating and even after feedback halfway through there was no change"
98208,"Strengths Prof Lindenlaub is a very clear and behaving professor, probably the best economics one Ive had! The TAs are also super helpful. The exams are very fair in terms of what they test.  Weaknesses no glaring ones come to mind, the course does move rather fast but after the midterm evaluation Prof slowed it down."
98208,"Strengths - great lectures and decent psets Weaknesses - discussion just a reiteration of lectures, would love to see more problem-solving"
98208,The course is very well structured and the professor lectures well. One weakness of the course is feedback on problem sets and exams. I felt like I knew my score but it wasn't very clear to me what I got points off for.
98208,"Strength - good curve on exams, concepts can be interesting at times and relevant to the real world Weakness - hard to engage a class that large"
98208,Section was helpful but lectures were not recorded
98208,"Strengths: slideshows are very clear and helpful, connection to real world issues is good, goes through all the main macro concepts Weaknesses: lot of the math felt unnecessary for explaining logical concepts, wish she made lectures more engaging bc it was easy to lose focus"
98208,The lecturing wasnt that good imo
98208,"Lectures are bad, psets and exams are fine though and easy to prepare for."
98208,Make the lectures more succinct and make clear what material is immediately relevant and what material is secondary.
98208,Lectures could be a little more engaging.
98208,The strengths of this course are that the material was directly correlated to problem sets and tests. There was no weaknesses in this course.
98208,"well organized, good stuff"
98208,"Strengths: Professor Lindenlaub cares about students and clearly knows what she's talking about very well, material is relevant to the real world, fair exams which test material from class AND force you to apply it, well-run and organized (lecture and sections). Weaknesses: Lectures move quickly with important information but are not recorded/transcribed. This made it difficult to clarify misconceptions from lecture or to review what was said; overcrowded Friday office hours"
98208,"Lectures and slides are very helpful, professor does good job of not doing math problems in class. Sections are very helpful - review difficult material and take student opinion into consideration. Could have more practice material for final exams.  Attempted to instill intuition, but did so within the frame of a model. I think it would be beneficial to have intuition BEYOND these models. This seems more conducive to innovation and thorough understanding. Could be accomplished by approaching economic problems conceptually before approaching them with concrete equations."
98208,"A Strength is that the slides were generally clear.   A weakness of this course is that the problem sets were quite lengthy, and clarifying questions at office hours was not always fully possible due to the high demand. It could be improved by perhaps allowing for the pset to be reviewed during office hours."
98208,"strengths  -focus on intuition through problem sets, exams and sections helped us actually understand the intuitions which is very useful  -clear structure of the material weaknesses  - the lectures could have focused more on explaining the intuition and lecture slides should have some notes on that since it was required by psets and exams so much -the professor could solve the math in real time in class and explain it with more detail"
98208,"Strengths: I felt like the lectures for this course were fascinating and engaging. I loved the number of real-world applications discussed in the lecture since it made the models we were building feel very useful. There were also helpful office hours for this course. Weaknesses: The problem sets were a bit long and had a lot of unnecessary analysis in my opinion. I understand that long problem sets provide lots of practice with the material, so if making them shorter is not an option, splitting up the problems into more digestible pieces would be nice. Sometimes there would be 4-5 tasks in one subpart of a question, making the problem sets seem very tedious to comb through and complete, so splitting things up and organizing would have made them easier to digest."
98208,"Strengths: highly engaging lectures; interesting and relevant problem sets; abundance of support from TFs and peer tutors. Weaknesses: some parts of lectures were often too fast, particularly the handwritten derivations."
98225,could be improved by having lecture slides instead of just blackboard notes
98225,"Strengths: Clear to follow, reasonable psets and tests Weaknesses: Could have had more real-world applications"
98225,"strengths: econometrics is a cool topic  weaknesses: where do I begin... the professor provides no notes or class materials. The only ""learning"" in this class consists of the professor writing on the chalkboard and then promptly erasing it. If you miss what he wrote, tough luck I don't mean to be offensive, but I could not understand what the professor was saying 80% of the time due to his accent, adding another layer of difficulty to lectures lectures are not recorded, so you really have no reference if you miss something class is as difficult as a math class, yet on the awful grading curve of the economics department. There are only 20-30 other students and they all act hyper-competitive because every single one of them is determined to be on top of the curve"
98225,Strenghts: great mix of theory and practice; psets were interesting; sections were great; Prof. Kim often reviews previous lectures. Weaknesses: could be heavier on the math at times; lectures can be fast-paced
98225,"Strengths: material was reviewed in class, which meant that even though the material was difficult and often not intuitive, we learned by practicing it over multiple lectures, problem sets and sections. The class is well-structured, and from the problem sets and practice exams, it was clear what we were expected to learn and internalize. The problem sets were difficult, but there was an incredible amount of support in office hours and TA sections, so the work always felt manageable. Weaknesses: There were no notes or slides posted for this class, and while the textbook was helpful, it didn't exactly follow what we were learning for lecture."
98225,"Weaknesses: NO notes, Min just writes on chalk and we blindly copy things down, explanations could be valuable Strengths: TA Bjoern"
98225,Well taught class with empirical examples to accompany really strong theoretical foundations
98225,"Strengths: Comprehensive coverage of topics around linear regression and its many variations. You'll cover a lot, and the vast majority of content is relevant.  Weaknesses: Professor Kim lectures quite quickly, so if you're a slower notetaker, you might simply miss out on some content. After he erases the board, the only way for you to see it again is to borrow classmates' notes. That can become troublesome if you need to borrow notes often. Prof Kim usually doesn't post his notes on Canvas - that was the biggest weakness for me."
98225,"Strengths: very organized and thorough lectures. Good balance between abstract theory/proofs and concrete examples. Weaknesses: uses Stata for every problem set which is kinda useless, but intuitive and easy to use"
98225,"Outstanding course, its challenging in nature but it rewards hard work and taking time outside of class to review the material on ones own will pay dividends"
98225,"I think overall the course does a good job of addressing a wide breath of concepts and laying an econometric foundation. It helps you understand the theory behind a lot of things, so your understanding is well rounded. Although the psets tried to address this, I think though that I could have benefited from more coding practice because I still feel a little unequipped to do anything more than the most baseline econometric work/applications in reality, even if I understand the theory. Also, sometimes lectures are so math/proof heavy that it can be easy to get lost."
98225,"Weaknesses of the course are that there were no resources or materials at all for students to rely on. There were recordings, no lecture slides, no additional videos, no supplementary materials besides the TA (who was amazing)."
98225,"Good content but lecture format was not great, too much information dumped on you at once"
98229,"Strengths: interesting content Weaknesses: professor's lectures & material delivery, obstruct concepts without any explanations whatsoever."
98229,The lectures were very uninteresting and often hard to follow for extended periods. A restructuring of the class to make it more engaging is much needed.
98229,"Very interesting, lectures/content could have more structure to them to allow for students to prepare for lectures etc."
98229,"Lectures were well organized and easy to track the trajectory of learning for the class, which was helpful when learning and growing with a bunch of different models for looking at maco trends."
98229,"The strength is that it gives you a solid understanding of historical and modern trade models that you can use to model current trade flows and patterns. The material can sometimes get very dry and it involves a lot of graphs and indifference curves, budget constraint lines etc.. If that speaks to you, definitely give the course a shot. I felt like lectures were also sometimes not that exciting and often found myself and others losing interest as the class neared its end. The two guest lectures during the term helped to change things up a bit very nicely though!"
98229,This course might be improved by making it a bit more interactive. Some class polls or discussions might help in this regard. The strengths of this class are that the material is important and interesting. It is also presented in a very clear way by a very knowledgeable instructor.
98229,The class was a little weird and different than my other econ courses but I enjoyed it
98229,"Strength: low workload Weaknesses: incredibly boring, i struggled to pay attention. Very disorganized, they would post psets later than planned and we had to submit them in a rush. Pset questions are hard to understand on a logic level"
98229,I love the way he teaches on the board.
98229,"I appreciated that the professor thought through all of the information he presented to the students during the lecture instead of just going through slides. The problem sets didn't have significant relation to the lecture materials, which made it slightly hard to prepare for exams. A bit more structure during lectures would also have been appreaciated."
98229,"The course had no structure, it felt like we were jumping from one economic model to another without knowing how they were connected to each other. The PSETS were complicated and hard to understand, completing them with in class instruction was impossible and even with one on one time in office hours, I was often more confused than when I came in. The lecture slides were helpful but the exams were not reflective of the PSETS."
98231,the class content was maybe interesting but mostly not integral
98231,exams and psets are more application based which was nice.
98231,"Strengths: professor was incredible, material is interesting Weaknesses: a lot of repetitiveness in lectures, every class was surrounding paper studies (which isn't necessarily a bad thing in my opinion)"
98231,"Strengths: very clear narrative and connections between different parts of the course, Prof Munshi is a very engaging lecturer. TFs are very helpful. Weaknesses: sometimes we dive too deep into the details of the paper, and I don't understand the technicalities and they are not tested on exams. Expectations for exams are unclear so it's difficult to know what to study for."
98231,"Strengths: Great Professor, engaging lectures, able to distill sophisticated concepts down to a level that anyone can understand, interesting papers on economic development Weaknesses: Problem Sets and Exams not very linked to development economics or to the lectures."
98231,"strengths: lectures were fun and based on research papers, mostly papers the prof was involved in weaknesses: none! perhaps prof can post practice exams"
98231,The course was relaxed but interesting.
98231,"Prof. Munshi is a great lecturer and is definitely very passionate about this subject (after all, a lot of the papers we focus on are his own research). He is very helpful and is good at explaining broad topics. He does a good job of building on top of each lecture. Although class lectures were very detailed and math-heavy at times, exams and psets focused more on large topics.  A weakness is that the course is rather fast-paced, and if you miss a class, you'll be rather lost."
98231,"The psets and the midterms were not really conducive to help students learn outside of the classroom despite Prof Munshi's extreme skill and engagement as a lecturer. The class was interesting, but there was hardly enough work to actively engage with the material on a deeper or sufficient level."
98231,"Strengths: Prof Munshi was very passionate and knowledgeable in the field, offering several of his own insights from his own research Weaknesses: few assignments or assessments make up the bulk of the grade."
98231,More clearness on how to study for the exam maybe
98231,"Strengths - feels like you're engaging with real econ, light workload, fair evaluation"
98231,"Strengths: Lectures, prof, exams Weaknesses: People were not that engaged (half showed up)"
98231,Good solid lecture course. I think there could have been more guidance for the exams. The psets were very short and (aside from the last pset being very similar to the exam) did not instill confidence that the exams would go well. I almost wonder if having more pset material would assist in this weakness. Professor Munshi was a great and engaging lecturer and Burke was a wonderful TA.
98231,"strengths: interesting topics, unique approach to economics compared to most Yale classes, manageable workload  weaknesses: the lecture slides could be clearer and with more explanations, sometimes it was hard to review them on my own"
98231,"Strengths: course organization is good, fair exams, Prof Munshi is a great professor and a super kind guy, great teaching staff who answered questions well; Weaknesses: not many, perhaps sometimes lectures were a bit fast near the end of classes. Sometimes psets were a little vague in what they were asking for but going to OH usually helped"
98231,"strength: passionate professor, exposure to interesting content without a lot of workload  weakness: there's no good way to prepare for the exams, if you don't come to the lecture (which people often did since it was at 9am in Watson) then it's hard to catch up"
98231,"Strengths: Munish is a great lecturer; you get to see how economics research is done, which is really valuable if you've mainly been taking a lot of theory-centric economics courses. Weaknesses: None really"
98259,"There could be more student engagement, perhaps through discussion posts so that everyone has the chance to contribute meaningfully"
98259,"great readings, especially fichte, woodson, freire, hooks. stanley has an idiosyncratic take on rousseau's emile though, which he put forth as if it were universally accepted. rousseau is neither as weird nor interesting as stanley thinks and should probably not feature as much in the readings. also we read too much plato, god knows we have to read the republic in every other course at yale, at least stanley had a good take on it though. replace it with queer theory or something idk, stanley talked a lot about contemporary trans issues but we didn't read any trans authors so fix that for the next class."
98259,"Less philosophy, more education. And a more cohesive structure is necessary for this class to be remotely palatable."
98259,"This course gives you a lot context on foundational readings, definitely take it!"
98259,"The strengths are that the Professor offers very engaging, rigorous lectures that clarify and expand upon the course readings and materials. I particularly enjoyed the wide array of scholarship that we studied, including European philosophers, Black Feminist Theorists/Critical Race Theorists, etc.. I also appreciated the wide latitude that we were given in the essays, as offering multiple prompts ensured that I could write on a topic that resonated with me. Professor Stanley really created an inclusive educational atmosphere, he was very accessible and communicative, and charismatic."
98259,Stanley is an amazing professor. Everyone should take a class with him. Great midterm and final paper structure.
98259,Would be helpful to have an outline of the class agenda and what we will be learning each day. Felt at times I wasnt sure where Prof. Stanley was going with his tangents or stories.
98259,"The course is very heavily focused on both US past history and current events (although readings varied, Professor Stanley's lectures often focused on this). If you are more interested in a general / international perspective on EDST, I recommend a different course. However, if your interest is in the politics of US Education then this is a good class."
98259,This class could benefit from less lecturing and more discussion in the class. I also think that we are lucky to have a TF in the class but we did not reap many of those. benefits. I think the should TF should hold additional office hours.
98259,"This was a great course, we went with our own flow which was nice."
98259,"The syllabus has important and interesting worksreading load was unmanageable sometimes when Professor Stanley emailed readings out with short notice, but when he followed the syllabus, the reading level felt manageable."
98260,way too long so sorry i always lost focus
98260,Strengths - relatively interesting content Weaknesses - powerpoints quite boring and lecture style not overly engaging
98260,"This course was very organized and clearly structured. I felt like the assignments and exams fairly tested the material we were taught, but the exams were a graded hard."
98260,"I wish it was less taught out of the textbook, whenever we went off book and Professor Duchsherer shared more modern studies, it was the most interesting."
98260,"Weaknesses -- The course adhered very strictly to the textbook, so the personal interests of Prof Duchscherer weren't really explored.   Strengths -- very understanding of student needs, flexible. Made all materials accessible online"
98260,This class was very clearly presented. I never felt like there was any question of what the content would be on an exam or what we were learning. The only issue was that sometime lecture felt like it moved very slowly and the slides were all plain and with few images and like calibari font or something. It needed a little more engaging elements.
98260,"Some strengths of the course is that the workload was fairly light. I never felt like I was running to do the work, and the fact that there were only two tests that we were given dates of far in advance was really helpful, I was able to set aside time to study beforehand. Weaknesses of the course would be that it again was kind of surface level, I kind of wish that we could have gone in more detail about studies, but for the sake of time I understand. Also generally the presentations weren't that engaging but again it's a lecture course so I can't be too picky."
98260,"Some of the lectures were deplorable in content. One in particular discussing psychological differences between democrats and republicans was insanely biased. I am not at all political and I felt an urge to defend republicans from the subtle, yet intense beating they were receiving. This lecture should not be taught in future. Along similar lines, the course referenced an enormous amount of correlation studies which made big claims with little evidence. To follow these studies with ""more research is needed"" (which was often the case) does not excuse them being taught to begin with."
98260,"Strengths: the course was designed well so that each topic led into the other and set the foundation for subsequent lectures. I felt like the material was structure in a way that made it easy to understand and it was comprehensive. Weakness: there was a lot of material which could be overwhelming at times, I also think that perhaps reducing the amount of topics covered may allow students to more deeply engage with particular topics. I felt like I got a pretty solid surface level understanding of a lot of topics."
98260,"Strengths: interesting content, clear lectures, essay assignments and exams were straightforward and good at assessing how well we understood the material and how to apply it Weaknesses: lectures were not particularly engaging, exams had a lot of content on them, and the word limits for essays were too low (prompts asked for too much to be accomplished in too little space, and often my TA's feedback would ask me to expand on things yet I was already at the word limit)"
98260,"The strengths were how well the concepts were explained. The weaknesses are how much was covered, it was at times too fast to understand the concepts."
98260,"Strengths = Interesting material  Weaknesses = I think there are too many assignments for it being a lecture class. Some of the time, it was difficult to balance the essays and exams, and I think that for some of the essays, I did not learn much. To improve, there could maybe be less essays."
98260,"Strengths were that it was a very straightforward class in the sense that you knew what you were going into every class. Weaknesses were that the lectures weren't very engaging and the professor basically just read the words on the slides so sometimes it didn't seem worth going to lecture, especially when it was recorded. The material itself was interesting but it could have been made more applicable to our lives or interactive in the sense that I wish we had interacted with other students in the class more to supplement our learning."
98260,"The lectures could have been more engaging with mixing mediums. Maybe some videos, examples, different slide formats, demos. I liked the content but the delivery being the same every time just got a little repetitive and boring sometimes.   Strengths: lots of content learned very fast, very organized and can tell Prof. Duchscherer cares! Grading was kind and assignments were reasonable."
98260,Nice mix of assignments-exams. Interesting topics
98260,Strengths: The creativity of short assignments; Weaknesses: Exams that tended to test memorization over interpretation of concepts.
98260,"The readings are very central to the textbook, and the lectures are well-structured and all have a conclusion, which I really appreciated! The writing assignments really spread the coursework out in a very manageable way and provided an opportunity for individual learning and feedback."
98260,"The lectures were not super engaging, making it hard to enjoy the subject. Finding ways to keep the class engaged and not using slides with just sentences on them might help solve this problem."
98260,I liked the format of the class a lot. I think the exams were a little tough and graded too harshly. I think it would be helpful to have review sessions before exams too. Or practice tests so we know what to expect
98260,Strengths: The course is very organized; the slides are well put together (and uploaded before class) and lectures are recorded. Weaknesses: There are quite a bit of essays you have to do though.
98260,"I think the classes basically being a summary of the textbook readings is a weakness, since it decreased the engagement I had with the class. I also had mixed feelings about having both papers and exams, though the workload was reasonable."
98260,It felt like a modern approach. It was a lot of content for every class.
98260,"A strength of this course was Prof. Duchscherer's teaching style. Each lecture was well organized, grounded in the psychological literature, and offered students the opportunity to further consider questions or areas which remain uncertain in the field of social psychology."
98260,The essays were a good supplement to the class material as they connected well to the material. The lectures were easy to follow because the slides contained all the same information as was said.
98260,"The content for this course is very clear, but the lectures are often a little boring (just going through whatever is on the slides). I appreciate the clarity but sometimes it's hard to stay engaged."
98260,Strengths: assignments were not overwhelming but you still get to learn a lot about psychology research Weakness: lectures were pretty boring and were not that engaging
98260,"Strengths: the essay topics are very fun and engaging, and I enjoyed writing them. The course material was also very attention-grabbing, and I loved lecture.  Weaknesses: the way exams were graded was a little opaque; I wasnt really sure why I was getting things wrong"
98260,This course is very organized and I love the feedback we get back from our writing assignments. I just wish the exams were a little less difficult. I spend a while studying for them and using different strategies and yet I am always disappointed by how I do. I think that there should be less multiple choice questions and more short answer questions that reflect our ability to engage in depth with the course material.
98260,Strengths: interesting material and energetic teacher weaknesses: sometime I felt like lectures were just being directly red off the slides and that I didn't need to go
98260,"The strengths are that the course is straightforward, in that the assignments are well-spaced out, and the lectures will help you succeed in those assignments. The weakness was that the lectures were quite repetitiveessentially every lecture is in the same format and the lectures are packed with text, which decreased my level of engagement."
98085,strengths -- the professors are all lovely and really care about the subject matter. weaknesses -- it's a ton of information and can be really overwhelming. there are also not a lot of readings for the course which makes it somewhat difficult to orient yourself to the different topics that are being presented
98085,"The surprise-attack weekly sections were not ideal, but the lectures were engaging and interesting. It also seems unfair to have a final be worth so much when the lecture slides don't have a lot of information on them, which makes studying for the final exam difficult even if you've taken good notes."
98085,Office Hours that started weeks after the semester began was not ideal.
98085,"This class was very difficult to follow--by the end of the course, it felt that I was one of the only students in it who was not majoring in a subject that this course was a pre-req for. The numbers continued to dwindle throughout the whole semester, and we were often addressed as being students in the major, despite it being an introductory level class. Furthermore, the difference in instructors varied, as did the difficulty of the class depending on who was teaching. Maybe it is because the TFs came from vastly different specialties, but they did not seem well informed in the subject of the class for the most part. None of them ever showed up to lecture, so much of section often became regurgitating to them what we had learned in lecture so they could (often improperly) answer our questions. Section was also very all over the place--we rarely had assignments, never discussed the reading (which at some points seemed optional and at other points did not), and when people had questions, they were often not answered. I also feel that I was very rarely given reassurance that I was actually completing assignments correctly.   Finally, the final is 46% of the grade. Is that even allowed? Someone could have straight As and by the time the final came around, still risk failing the class."
98085,"Strengths:  - lectures were engaging and has a cohesive narrative that was helpful to my understanding of different topics - gave me a very specific as well as comprehensive view across the precambrian, Paleozoic, mesozoic, and Cenozoic periods, on the climate, animal life (terrestrial and marine), plant life, and geology/continental dispersal. - no work outside of class on a regular basis unless to review class notes and to study for exam (EXCEPT for the midterm essay that came out of nowhere). Low workload meant I could give myself time to really review what I'd learned in class, and that I kept up as long as I went to lectures. Weaknesses: - office hours led by TFs were not the most useful, because they didn't often know what things would be tested on and what was important to know. I feel like TFs would be much more helpful if they have taken the class before. - the essay came out of nowhere and was a full on book review. Though I enjoyed reading my book and writing the essay, we received little guidance about it from professors and TFs. - final exam studying was scattered and different TFs were saying confusing things. - slides uploaded to canvas had no notes - obviously that meant we had to pay extra attention in class, but when I missed something small it was hard to get that info."
98085,"Each professor was engaged, interested in their subject matter, and willing to answer questions. The class could better communicate key questions such as HOW did life first emerge, and WHY major progressions throughout the phylogenetic tree occurred, rather than focusing on what specifically happened."
98085,"I think the strengths were that there are three different teachers that teacher different sections of the course, which made it more engaging and interesting. However, this makes it so that there is inconsistenty with how difficult or confusing the material can be. One thing to keep in mind is that the final is 46% of your grade, which is incredibly weird. They made the section grade 9% which makes no sense. It makes it so that last two sections of the class much more emphasized that the first section, which I did not like."
98085,Lectures very confusing and unstructured.
98085,More continuity with the sections
98085,"There are no assignments aside from the midterm essay, which makes the workload less than other classes. However, this means that most of the knowledge is self incentivized. The class itself is extremely interesting, the lectures are dynamic and interesting to listen to; the three lecturers have very different styles, which can be hard to adjust between the switches."
98085,Lots of valuable info but disorganized at times.
98085,"The strengths of this course is that it's taught by three professors, and it's a nice opportunity to get to know the professors in EPS"
98085,"weakness: anjan's part was very hard to follow. he said in the first lecture that he has no recordings, no textbook, and his powerpoint doesn't have much words, so we should pay attention to what he is saying. but for someone who has no background in phylogenetic terms, it is impossible to follow."
98085,"Strengths: very interesting content, helps students understand our present moment more deeply, lecturers are good storytellers Weaknesses: the assignment/grading structure of this class could be greatly improved. Your grade was essentially determined by three factors: a midterm, an essay, and a final. More regular graded assignments (essays, labs, reading responses, worksheets) could have encouraged deeper engagement with the course and a better understanding of its content."
98085,"Strengths of the course: I really enjoyed the three-instructor structure of the course and supplementary section meeting with a TF. I loved having three experiences with varying teaching styles that made sense to the content they were teaching, and the support of the TFs was great. The labs of the course and visits to fossils in KGL were also incredibly fascinating, and I anticipate this will only become better as the Peabody museum reopens.   Weaknesses: Perhaps a little more support with the vertebrate paleontology section of the course would be helpful, or posting lectures as Professor Briggs did. Otherwise, this course was wonderful."
98097,"Strengths: This course is very well-organized and well-structured, and Professor Prum is a charismatic and kind professor. I found the exams to be quite doable, and the work is spread out evenly throughout the semester. I also thought that the course is designed in a way that makes it equally accessible to both science and non-science majors; I am a history major and had never taken any kind of biology course in college, but this course did not assume much prior knowledge while simultaneously being engaging for all levels.  Weaknesses: I had a few friends who struggled a lot on the exams. The exams are not curved, and so you do truly need to attend lecture and study for them in order to do well. But from my experience, this is not challenging."
98097,"I found the lectures to be at times a little too fast paced. However Professor Prum is an outstanding lecturer who captivates the whole class and keeps them interested and engaged. I thought there could be better support for the exams, there was little/no direction or advice on how to study (maybe I just struggled as a non-stem major understanding how to study)"
98097,"Strengths: I thought the material was really interesting and fun to engage with. There was no regular work, just exams and a paper (which I really like). Prum is a super engaging lecturer, and it was cool to be learning from a top researcher in the field. He was so excited about everything he taught. Weaknesses: the term paper is ten pages long and there was not a lot of support for the writing process. I also didn't like the very beginning of the course where we went over the phylogeny of birds (felt a little unmotivated/boring to start the class with)."
98097,"Strengths: Professor Prum is fantastic. His knowledge of birds, and anything somewhat adjacent to birds, is boundless. If you ever want to take a class with someone who not only guides a field but is the field, you should absolutely take ornithology. The class gave me a much greater appreciation for the natural world at large.   The exams are fair albeit quite detailed. I would recommend reading the book and taking notes then using the class to supplement notes.  Weaknesses: I think including key terms more clearly at the start of a new slide section would be helpful. Sometimes it would be difficult to know which terms to take particular note of. Similarly, including some additional text on slides might be useful when there is more difficult terminology.   Involving the TAs more may also benefit the course. I would sometimes have questions, but Prum wouldn't be at his office hours."
98097,Strengths: Amazing lectures  Weaknesses: Final paper really snuck up -- I think that there should be more structure (like requiring students to submit their topic/brief outline by the midterm) to prevent procrastination
98097,Difficult course because there is no homework and the tests are worth almost all your grade.
98097,"Though I think Professor Prum is very engaging, the balance of material did not feel like a great representation of what was on the syllabus. We ended up diving far deeper into some subjects, while barely touching on others."
98097,"The professor is very passionate about the subject and gave very engaging lectures. The tests were pretty difficult, but the material itself is very manageable and interesting."
98097,"The strengths of this course are the structure, the professor, and the contentessentially all of it! The structure of three weekly lectures, two cumulative lecture examinations, one cumulative final, and a research paper makes this course incredibly doable in terms of workload. There is no outside ""homework."" With that said, this class is NOT a gut and should not be taken as such. If you want to learn about birds, this is the course for you. While the ""cumulative"" format can be scary, ultimately, it only benefits you for the final. The content moves from dinosaur origins to flight to physiology to breeding systems to evolutionary theory in a smooth fashion. Professor Prum is outstanding! He gives exciting lectures and explains everything in detail using helpful analogies. He genuinely wants everyone in the class to learn and be excited about birds. Also, the birding field trips are wonderful experiences to test your knowledge in the field! One possible weakness was that the slideshows of the lecture material are only posted a week before the exam; however, I found this to be manageable and not a real source of stress."
98097,I think the lectures are at a good pace and that the information was very well delivered. I would say that the midterms were a little oddly timed (a little too close together) and that the final paper snuck up on a lot of people. Other than that the strengths are the fantastic course content and Prof. Prum-- he is a super engaging lecturer!
98097,"I wish we had some small quizzes throughout, whether take home/in-class or not for a grade, just to have more incentive for retention of what we learned in lecture"
98097,I thought we spent two much time discussing mechanisms of color production - I wish could couldve spent more time on vocal behavior or behavioral ecology.
98097,I quite liked the lectures; I do wish the slides were posted sooner before the exams to facilitate early studying.
98097,"The lectures of the course were fascinating, and Professor Prum was a very engaging lecturer. However, at times the lectures went over material very quickly, which could be challenging during more complex units. The addition of outside reading of the textbook would often clear up any confusion since note-taking in class needed to be supplemented. Though laid out in the syllabus, the assignments and expectations of the class were a bit vague. Throughout the course, I was never aware of my performance or the pace of the class."
98097,Wel paced and well structured.
98097,"Professor Prum is a wonderful professor and lecturer, and the material is really engaging. I also liked the format of the course, since it was nice not to have much work and be able to focus on learning the material. The field trips were also a highlight. I honestly wouldn't change anything, unless the field trip to Ecuador could be reinstated!"
98292,The Professor is amazing ! Dr Bennet is great and I would recommend any class with her. The MATLAB part of the course felt a bit rushed and tedious but all in all I have no major complaints.
98292,I think trying to fit in three programming languages in one semester gives students a whiplash because we get no time to get used to one language before moving onto another
98292,"Strengths: The course is very well structured and organized to facilitate learning. Dr. Bennett is a great professor, she covered topics in a way truly fit for beginners so that the material was understandable. Dr. Bennett was also very nice and made an effort to get to know us, as well as be understanding to students circumstances. There were also plenty of resources provided for to help like recorded lectures, sample codes, lecture slides, and peer tutor hours."
98292,It is very well structured.
98292,"This was a well taught course, the expectations for learning were very clear as well as assignment instructions and help opportunities."
98292,The class covers a lot of material in a short time. Especially with C++. The biggest issue with the class is that office hours are often only staffed with one person so you end up waiting for an hour just to get 10 min of help which was not enjoyable
98292,"Strengths are the structure of the class, and how readily available help is. The workload however is quite high, especially if you're a beginner."
98292,good class but a more involved lecture could be nice. office hour structure was weird
98292,psets are really helpful for learning and there are tons of office hrs
98292,"I think that this course was very well structured. The help sessions were really stressful to get into during peak times, but other than that, the amount of support was great."
98292,"This is one of the most well-organized courses I have ever taken. The sheer number of drop-in office hours with Professor Bennett and the help sessions with the TAs and peer tutors are invaluable. As someone with no prior coding experience, I don't think I could have taken this class without that support, and I'm grateful for it. The optional small group discussion section was also helpful."
98292,"Wile I really did like this course, the style of the exams is stressful and I feel that it doesn't do a good job of representing the programming skills of the students."
98292,"This was a great course, extremely well organized, applicable, and lots of help available. Only weakness was that it is not as collaborative as other yale stem classes and all the office hours were on zoom which was annoying."
98292,"This course was well taught, however, there weren't always enough ta's during office hours."
98292,This course was very well organized and there was a lot of office hours and help available
98292,"The organization of the course was excellent - the Canvas page was laid out in the best way possible and the help sessions were very accessible. I also liked the structure of the lectures, where there was a sample code to accompany every small portion."
98292,better guidance on how to achieve maximum grade on psets
98292,"The course slides are extremely helpful in addition to the sample codes. If you have any issues, they can easily be solves through one of those options or the regularly occurring office hours."
98292,"Sometimes I found it difficult to focus in lectures, however, the slides and sample codes were my holy grail. Professor Bennett was extremely helpful in office hours as well. Overall, the course was very well organized and she really knew how to teach according to the students."
98292,Strengths: the teaching staff and everything to do with facilitating student learning. The feedback for every single assignment and exam was very clear and helpful. There was always somewhere to get help from and office hours were very productive.  Weaknesses: workload.
98292,Amazing professor! Well-structured class and easy to follow!
98292,"This course did very well at giving me clear feedback about how to get better at coding, and the homework always gave real world examples in how all of what we learn is useful."
98292,It was a great course! I didn' have really any programming experience but still found the material approachable and engaging.
98354,"I think it's a really interesting course filled with some fascinating information and a very thoughtful approach to language more generally. I genuinely learned a lot, and i think that the exercises and assignments helped me retain and understand the information. I did sometimes feel like the class was a lecture or structured more like a class I would have taken in high school than a seminar. I would have liked if we could have spent more time on discussion."
98354,"Peter grund is an amazing lecturer while also smartly involving students!! Very kind and understanding too without being too personal or overstepping. The content is in a more flipped classroom vibe so it is confusing at first but then good because there is always time to look back at readings later and figure out how to apply thing. Textbook is a little expensive and ran out at first, rent it soon. Good medieval credit!! Feels like a pset class at times. No collaboration allowed"
98354,"Strengths: I loved the structure of the course! It was great having a seminar-sized group where we could discuss, work together, and freely ask questions. The assignments were challenging but doable if you put in the work, and Peter was always available to help guide you in the right direction. The content of the course was also super interesting! Peter did an incredible job making everything seem relevant.  No weaknesses!"
98354,The course was much more detail-oriented than I expected.
98354,Professor Grund was a huge strength for this class
98354,"Loved this course! It was different from any English class I had ever taken, and the group energy was fantastic. Strengths: Professor Grund is wonderful, kind, and passionate. He was very organized when it came to assignments and always willing to make time during office hours. Weaknesses: if you're looking for a classic seminar, this is not for you! It feels a bit more like an intimate lecture with discussion mixed in."
98354,"This course was really well structured and organized, so we always knew what to expect in terms of work and assignments. Professor Grund was always enthusiastic and well-prepared in class, ready to clarify any questions or doubts and sharing his extensive knowledge of linguistics and the history of the English language with us."
98354,"Overall this course was wonderfully designed. I would suggest cutting down some of the daily assignments, however--it was hard to deeply engage with each of them, and maybe having one assignment due per week instead of one per class might streamline things a bit."
98354,"Strengths: Peter's kindness, enthusiasm, and warmth. He loves his subject area and wants us to love it, too! Lots of freedom in creating the final project was a plus. He was also very helpful in suggesting documents for the final project and offering us help and structure if we needed it. Very interesting subject matter. Weaknesses: The assignments and text analyses could feel like busy work at times; high workload. I would have preferred more literary/interpretive work rather than technically focused work."
98368,A smaller reading load would allow for increased engagement.
98368,"The strength was that the material was interesting to learn about, and so it never felt like a burden to do readings"
98368,"This course does an excellent job making you engage with questions of media and power in ways that I have never considered before. The readings are wide-ranging both in their content and difficulty, and they spark some very interesting discussions."
98368,"I wish there would be something from the lectures to look back on. I know the professor posts his slides after lecture, but they're mainly photos and don't contain any content. It helps that we discuss much of the topics in lecture through discussions, but since discussions are discussions I don't usually take many notes."
98368,"Strengths: the breadth and depth of the readings and variety of well-curated course materials. By interacting with so many types of media formats, you learn more innovatively and with increased engagement. The lectures and papers are engaging, and there is such a strong support network to ensure that students are learning and succeeding.  Weaknesses: it can be a little tough to stay on top of all of the readings because there are generally a lot of pages to read per week, but if you dedicate chunks of hours at a time, it's possible to read/view/hear every assignment."
98368,"John Peters is a fantastic lecturer. The readings assigned are interesting and deep. The mindset taught by the class is extremely valuable. Section was engaging and fun. One of the only weaknesses is that the sheer amount of reading, especially for an introductory course, is a bit overwhelming. As a result, many students (myself included) didn't do all of the readings. If the readings were about halved, or if I knew what readings were going to be most important for discussing in section, I probably would have done more of them, but because I didn't know which ones to do and because there were so many, I would often skip a lot of readings, and sometimes all the readings, for a given day."
98368,I don't see sometimes how the concepts relate to the lectures. I also wish the professor had more office hours because I was never able to get to know him. The lectures connected a lot of the course concepts between each other and helped us recognize the impacts of the readings in a larger context.
98368,"The course was very engaging. Professor Peters and my TA, Marcus Alaimo, were brilliant.  No weaknesses (perhaps too much reading)."
98368,"The class is very broad and abstract. It could benefit from some more depth into social media, and current news media. But overall it is really interesting and the ideas are fascinating."
98368,"It worker well as a intro course, buts its hard to keep track of what is happening the first few weeks. Its all over the place"
98368,good sections
98368,Read a lot of unique and interesting readings and the prompts really allowed me to write about stuff that I loved
98368,"This course was good as it offered a wide variety of material that related to the core subjects in media theory. The workload of readings was high, but was only an issue when there was time committed to some readings and they were rarely discussed."
98368,Loved lectures! Sometimes people werent prepared for section. The papers were fun to write
98368,"The paper topics were very interesting, and the readings were interesting too! The final exam was listed as taking only 3 hours but took nearly double that even for students working as efficiently as possible."
98368,great class. super facinating.
98368,Sometimes this course spoke too abstractly about each lesson and I was left to piece the subjects together in a way that would make sense for media studies. But I enjoyed that it pushed me to analyze media more intensely and to think about the world around me differently.
98368,"Everything is just impeccable! Fascinating readings and lectures, great professor and TFs. 10/10."
98368,"Strengths: I think JDP is the best lecturer I've ever had. The syllabus is totally wacky but you can get a lot out of it, and the ideas do end up gelling in the end. Weaknesses: The students--most people were taking the course for the writing credit, and it's very hard to be motivated when everyone around you is just there to get through the class. The class could be better organized to have more accountability--I wish I were forced to do the readings more often. The writing assignments are extremely open-ended, which is weird for a big intro class. I think this course would be better suited to a small, upper-level seminar format. As is, it could use more structured assignments and prompts."
98368,"Strength: Prof Peters is an engaging and entertaining lecturer. TA sections are very well organized. Weakness: If you thought this was a gut class, it really isnt"
98368,"Very strong class structure, but would be helpful to have more detailed lecture slides posted."
98368,This course is extremely unengaging. It was extremely unclear on how to do well.
98368,"The lectures were generally pretty brilliant. They always had a good flow and kept me engaged and interested in the materials. In contrast, some of the more academic readings felt sort of pointless or unfocused; plenty of the readings were quite interesting, but some of them just felt like there needed to be more guidance on what to focus on, especially when it came to section. When we read some 100 pages a week, it sometimes felt hard to figure out what to take away from the readings."
98368,The lectures are super engaging and the readings are great. Sometimes the structure feels a bit random/disorganized.
98368,The strengths of the course are that it really taught material that is outside of the mind and it helped you critically think. The professor taught the class well and talked clearly. There are no weaknesses to this course.
98368,"Strengths: lectures were really fun, both the professor and my section leader were super interesting and engaging, the lecture content was also really relevant and well organized to provide the best introduction to media theory. Weaknesses: perhaps slides could be slightly more detailed for review, and a couple of review sessions would be nice"
98368,"The lectures for this class were varied and always incredibly engaging. At the same time, I sometimes felt a little bit confused as to the intended take away for a given lecture, as the structure of the lectures was quite free flowing.  I think the weakness of this class was the lack of engagement in section. Some students treated the class a bit like a throw away and would show up to section having not attended lecture or done the reading. This lead to somewhat stunted section meetings, and I found section a bit discouraging for that reason. My TA was great though."
98368,Very broad subject matter but very fun.
98402,We could have just read the weekly packet on our own and not had lecture it felt like lecture was mostly just Professor Ehrgood reading it to us.
98402,"I love that we have 30 minute weekly sessions with a writing tutor, where we can talk in-depth about our writing."
98402,strength - 1 on 1 tutoring each week weakness - couldn't stay engaged in lecture
98402,"Cannot think of any obvious weaknesses... only one was that by the end of the course, it felt like there was a clear format / content / perspective that was what ended up in the X themes (selected student examples from the prior weak). I wish that Professor Ehrgood had done a better job at picking diverse pieces that showcased various writing styles. As someone who does not come from a strong writing background, it felt difficult to imagine myself ever writing one of these themes and it seemed as though the easiest way to achieve it was to write an angsty piece rather than strengthen and pursue my own writing style.  Strengths: super unique course format and idea -- really enjoyed!"
98402,Strengths: forced daily writing and 1 on 1 with a tutor is very helpful Weaknesses: lecture was very difficult to focus in and the daily writing itself is very challenging to keep up with
98402,I loved my tutor she was super helpful and I thought that doing the 300 words a day was relatively easy
98402,"Strengths: the tutors, the prompts  Weaknesses: lecture could be more engaging. Not sure how to fix this tho"
98402,"I felt so lucky to have such a wonderful tutor, but it seemed like a hit-or-miss tutor/tutee relationship, and I think that I would have gotten much less out of the class if I hadn't clicked with my tutor. I think the consistent workload is a strength, especially now that other assignments are piling up during finals period, and I appreciated the five built-in skips and three allowed late submissions. The biggest weakness for me was the lectures. Maybe Prof. Ehrgood's style and mine just didn't mesh, but I often found it hard to stay focused for a 2 hour post-lunch lecture that included lots of reading passages directly from the handout."
98402,"This course is so much fun, I think a strength is that you have to do the assignments and you have someone to personally edit and develop a relationship with. I wish the lectures were a bit more engaging, they were informative but sometimes dragged on."
98402,"Strengths: lectures, professor Ehrgood, my tutor, the prompts were varied, high reward  Weaknesses: its tough? Isnt that what you sign up for though?"
98402,"I thought that the themes themselves were flexible and mostly challenging. I felt, overall, that lectures were much longer than they needed to be; guest lectures that lasted an hour felt more productive and easier digested than the more typical 90-100 minute lecture."
98402,"I think the strength of the course is it's requirement to write (almost) every day. In that it succeeds. This year's course felt a bit disorganized across the board and I am unsure how much I learned beyond of the writing practice.  As I said to a friend, I think this moved the needle a bit in terms of improving my average writing but I don't believe it expanded my capacity for good writing in general."
98402,"I think that Daily Themes is one of Yale's oldest courses for a reason. I found the concept to be really, really interesting, but I found that Prof. Ehrgood's teaching style was just not appropriate for this course, which was so unfortunate considering his high reviews."
98402,"Strengths: Daily Themes is a unique course because whether you love it or hate it, you won't ever take a course like it again. There's something great about that. You learn a lot and in different type of challenge brought on by any other course.  Weaknesses: I would not say there are a lot of weaknesses in the actual class. Your experience varies by your tutor. I would say if you do not like your tutor try to change who it is or take the class another semester. it will be a miserable experience if you do not have a good tutor. The lectures dragged on and were boring. Very few times I found myself getting something out of them. You also will get burnt out at times, but that is part of the process."
98402,"Lectures a little long and frustrating. Creative writing lectures are hard to pull off. However, absolutely loved my tutor."
98402,"Strengths - Andrew's lectures were amazing, I left every class that he lectured in feeling delighted and inspired.  - I loved meeting with my tutor every week and getting feedback  - Being forced to write every day for a full semester is life-changing. It was so much work, but I wouldn't trade experience this for anything.   Weaknesses - There could have been more diversity in the pieces chosen in the lecture handouts. There were even some pieces repeated between weeks for different purposes, which felt like a bit of a waste because there is so much excellent writing out there to explore.  - The lecture we had on expressing magnitude was so confusing and inaccessible to someone without an extensive writing background. It was very overwhelming, and I barely understood it.  - The carrot-chasing of X-Themes is unavoidable. It caused me to obsess a bit over making sure everything I produced was a cohesive piece, when I think I could have benefitted from more experimentation if I didn't feel limited to tying every piece off with a bow."
98402,"Strengths: creative weekly prompts. I liked how each week was a different aspect of writing. Having the opportunity to revise themes was nice. Weekly meetings with my tutor were generally helpful. Andrew is an engaging lecturer as well. Weaknesses: Lectures just dragged onnn. If you could say something in 5 words Andrew would say it in 500. As a result, I would often space out during the two hour lectures. It might be better to have 75 minute lectures and a slightly longer meeting with our tutors."
98402,The focus of a new writing technique every week was a major strength. The only weakness was that we spent a while talking about metaphors.
98402,"Strengths: you get to write everyday and you really improve a lot. Weaknesses: experience with this course was highly dependent on individual tutors, I feel like only a small fraction of my tutor's comments were constructive and I wish tutoring sessions were more useful. My friends had a really enjoyable experience though. I also thought the lectures could be more helpful and the prompts could be more varied or non-technique based, they mostly covered basic information (like varying sentence length and asyndeton) that the average daily themes student would already be familiar with."
98402,"Strengths: If you have a good tutor like I did, 30 minutes once a week to focus on your writing is an incredible amount of quality time just to focus on your writing. The feedback you get will be incredible. Plus the process of writing every day will make your writing better.  Weaknesses: Lectures were, in almost every case, worse than useless. If Professor Ehrgood is teaching again, don't bother going to lectures. You won't miss anything."
98402,Its perfect.
98402,"The strength of the course is the relationship between the tutor and tutee. My tutor was truly exceptional, and I was always grateful for her helpful and incisive feedback. It is also a strength that you have to write almost daily--and creatively. The prompts were all very interesting, and I enjoyed responding to them. The course might be improved with more attention to the lecture. No other class of which I am aware has a 1 hr 50 min lecture--and for good reason. It is hard to make that an productive experience sitting and listening. I wonder if the class could meet multiple times a week for shorter times, or if there might be time in lecture for tutors and tutee groups to meet and discuss things in smaller groups? I always felt like I wanted more time with my tutor, though of course she is very busy and has a lot of tutees, too."
98402,"There were some weeks where I would have liked more alternate themes to choose from. (Not the first week though, I think it was good for us to start out with a clear language challenge we had to adhere to each day.)"
98402,I thought the class was perfect
98402,"I really liked the idea of this class, but I wish the prompts and lectures were more exciting. I heard there used to be happenings in lectures and I wish that would be brought back."
98402,The strengths are a great detailed attention to the mechanics of writing.
98402,The consistent pressure to write is helpful because you think about how you are going to write your theme at all times of the day. I think the lecture component was a bit of a weakness and felt tedious sometimes.
98402,The best part about this course are the weekly meetings with your writing tutor - it is amazing to get such detailed feedback on your writing and I often wished it was longer than 30 minutes a week! I think sometimes the content of the lectures could be improved - Professor Ehrgood is amazing but sometimes I wasn't sure how useful the lectures were in helping me understand different writing techniques
98402,"Strengths: You are introduced to many techniques that improve your writing. While the tutor meetings are a little scary, they are really helpful. Weaknesses: The weekly lecture was a little boring sometimes!"
98402,"Strengths: Writing in a disciplined way always makes you improve. I learned how to approach writing more creatively, think of new ideas, trust the process while writing, and became a lot more detail-oriented while reading/writing.  Weaknesses: its easy to slack off because the class is focused on discipline and self-motivation. Sometimes I submitted bad themes that I didn't try hard on and then regretted it later because I could've written something better."
98402,"Ehrgood's lectures are major site for improvement. The lectures were agonizingly dry and bland, with weekly topics that were poorly chosen and executed. The guest speakers were a welcome reprieve, particularly our guest for the dialogue unit. For a class of this renown, with such an interesting and flexible topic, lectures should surely be much more interesting, exciting, and engaging. The prompts this year were also not conducive to creativity, and often felt unnecessarily restrictive, repetitive, and much more like busy work than they should have been. The class must be radically improved to increase student learning and enjoyment in order to retain students next year."
98402,Strengths: consistency in assignment expectations Weaknesses: boring professor and few creative prompts
98402,I did what it set out to do: teach quick writing skills and help build discipline. It was great way to get fast and consistent feedback on your writing. Not only were tutors available often and friendly the lecturer Prof Ehrgood also made himself available and accesible for students.
98402,"Strengths - the rigor of daily writing is necessary and effective! Weaknesses - I wish meetings with the tutors were not simply 30 minutes a week. Having the meetings run for at least an hour would help, because often times the meetings felt rushed and I was not able to ask all of the questions that I wanted to ask."
98402,"Love this class. You have to be ready for it and ready to really put thought into your writing (I wasnt enough the first few weeks of the semester, but then I put more effort into it and it was much more rewarding). The lectures could feel a bit too English major-y in terms of writing strategy, when sometimes I wish it was a little bit more about trying to evoke what people naturally want to say in their writing. But overall, a great class that really lets you test yourself."
98402,"This course has many, many weaknesses. The fact that it is an hour and fifty minute lecture is an insane waste of time. Lectures were redundant and unhelpful. Because of how terrible lecture is, the quality of the class rests far too much on the quality of your tutor and if you, like me, have a terrible tutor, then this class becomes terrible. The prompts of this class might just be the worst part. Prompts were not in any way, shape, or form prompting. They were simply small constraints (if constraints at all) to put on the form of your pieces. This class requires an immense amount of creativity on the part of the writer. I had heard amazing things about the lectures in years past that helped bolster creativity when you were at home writing but the version of this course of this year (2023) is completely devoid of that. The deadline is also terribly unflexible. For some some reason to reach the goal of habit in your writing, every one is required to submit by 9 AM instead of being able to set their own deadline that would work the best with their writing and their own schedule. If the emphasis is on forming a habit, there's no reason students shouldn't be able to set their own deadline."
98402,"Great format if youre into it, can be hard to come up with what to actually write about though"
98402,Some of the prompts were great but others felt like they were looking for a trick/performance rather than good writing
98402,I thought the prompts were good - flexible while also encouraging us to try new things. The X-Themes chosen seemed to conform to a type; I would have liked to see a wider range of students' writing. The lectures could have been more succinct.
98402,This course could use better lectures that try to give specific pieces of advice on writing rather than offering examples.
98402,I wish this course was more easily accessible online. One advantage is that you could pick your themes submission schedule.
98402,My writing tutor was the best part of the course. Lectures were boring and poorly done.
98402,The lectures were often very chaotic and not the most engaging
98402,"I thought the daily prompts were generally very interesting and helpful. They challenged the writers, but left room for us to choose our own subject matter. I definitely took more from some weeks of lectures than others, but the assignments themselves were great."
98402,"lectures could have been much more engaging. the guest lectures were interesting, but I didn't get much out of Andrew's lectures that I wouldn't get from reading the packet. could incorporate activities, visuals, lessons (e.g. in the week on dialogue: how do you punctuate dialogue? Tips for what to put in dialogue vs narration? etc).  more variation of exemplary authors. got bored of Perec and Fadiman and Strunk/White  prompts also were hard to write for if they only had formal guidance like ""use adverbs."" maybe a big list of potential subject matter, handed out at beginning of term? or just more stimulating prompts"
98402,"Strength: the weekly lectures were excellent. As someone with little exposure to the English major, it was very helpful to be walked through various examples of writing that matched the topic of the week."
98402,The prompts were great and so were the handouts but too much of class was reading the handout verbatim
98402,"The strengths are the frequency of the writing assignments. The weaknesses are many. There appears to be disparity in the experiences with tutors. Some of the prompts feel unserious, either because my tutor made them feel as such or because they actually were."
98402,"The lectures could be more engaging, or have some added accountability to incentivize attendance"
98402,"Strengths are that it feels like a relatively low stakes way to get out of your comfort zone with writing, and to get in the habit of just sitting down to write at any moment. Weakness is just that sometimes its hard to know how much your improving since the focus of the themes changes every week."
98402,id like more diverse prompts and content based prompts !
98402,"Strengths - forced habit, clear feedback from tutors, interesting prompts Weaknesses - boring and sometimes irrelevant lectures, feedback was not in the form of grades so much as general positive or negative commentary"
98402,Lectures could be more engaging and stray more from the handout.
98402,Pick a new professor. Don't take it if Ehrgood is teaching.
98402,The strengths are the incredible one-on-one tutoring that allows you to hear from a knowledgeable reader about your work and revise it step by step. Weaknesses are how difficult it can be to muster up the energy to write something good.
98402,"The weekly tutor meetings are extremely valuable. They certainly improved the technical quality of my writing, and also pushed me to consider how other people read my work (can readers visualize a given scene, am I assuming readers will feel the same emotion I do without sufficient explanation, etc.).   Almost all of the prompts when I took the class focused on form rather than content (I don't think this is always the case). Many were along the lines of ""Write a theme that includes a periodic sentence,"" or ""Write a theme that includes a catalogue of negatives."" This wasn't all of the themes - others asked for a character sketch, or a monologue, or something more nebulous - but most of them asked for some particular structure related to the focus of the week. I think these kinds of prompts were helpful, they pushed me to think about different aspects of writing, but I wouldn't have minded a few more content-focused prompts, maybe pushing me to write in different genres, or just allowing for an easier time coming up with ideas.  The lectures were helpful in that they highlighted various examples of the techniques we talked about, but at times I felt like I could just read the lecture handout without the lecture itself and get almost as much out of it. I don't really have a suggestion for something to do differently, though - having a professor talk for two hours about a general topic in writing might just be a bit awkward regardless of how it's done. The guest lectures definitely felt more focused, though, I think because the professors had particular theories or ideas they wanted to get across, rather than, for example, a general understanding of metaphor."
98402,"Strengths: You write every day. Learning by experience is a very real thing, especially for something as abstract as writing. Weaknesses: Lectures felt pointless. Prof. Ehrgood was very interesting and clearly very passionate about diction, but I often felt like I could have just grabbed the packet of examples and read them at home."
98402,"Weakness: Although the name of the course is daily themes, and the point is writing nearly every single day, I think I would have benefitted from writing only 3 times a week, instead of the required 5. I usually ended up only having 3 or so pieces I was proud of a week, and around 2 that I just phoned in cause I needed to write about something. Maybe it was just a heavy workload semester for me already and people with lighter workloads enjoyed the 5 days a week, but I would have preferred less. Additionally, while I like that you can write about whatever topic for each piece, as someone who struggles to think of something unique to write about 5 times for 12 weeks, it would have been nice to have some optional prompts to get the gears turning on what I could write about. Strengths: It taught me to really appreciate what goes into writing and how to better read others writing. Not merely focusing on the content or meaning of the writing, but how to appreciate the style and form that the writing takes. The system of meeting with a tutor every week to go over your writing is amazing and has led to a greater improvement in my writing than any other course I have taken at Yale. Professor Ehrgood's inclusion of sources and writers I was not familiar with beforehand was also very cool and good for exposure to different styles."
98402,"strengths: comprehensive curriculum, extremely engaging one-on-one tutoring sessions, consistency in assignments with an appropriate amount of leniency  weaknesses: 9am deadline didn't seem too great for morning writers, if it was due at noon, there might have been more opportunity to write in the morning with more time."
98402,"Strengths: I absolutely LOVED my mentor and felt that the act of writing every day made my writing improve dramatically. I really liked that the prompts were open-ended in terms of subject matter and focused more on syntax than content. Overall, one of my favorite classes at Yale, if not my favorite class! Weaknesses: The lectures were often not the most engaging (though I loved the guest lecture by Derek Green). While I appreciated Professor Ehrgood's emphasis on connecting the lectures to the prompts, during most lectures, we read excerpts from 10-20+ page packets, and not much explanation was given as to why the excerpts we read were good. I would have appreciated a more standard pedagogical lecture format like Professor Green's, in which the professor gave us clear tools to use in our writing and explained exactly how to incorporate them. More student engagement would also be wonderfulperhaps students could gather in smaller groups and read their pieces to each other, or the professor could give out prompts and have some structured time to write in class. We spent a long time reading X themes aloud as well, which often showcased only a sliver of students' writing and had similar voices/subject matter; I think the time would be better served if students read the X themes on their own time. Lastly, perhaps having a break in the middle of the lecture period or hosting ""happenings"" would increase lecture attendance."
98402,"Strengths: the 1-on-1 tutor meetings! They were an unparalleled experience to really focus on your writing and work closely with someone in discussing it. Also a great course for focusing every day on growing as a creative writer and writing pieces that are personally meaningful and important. To me felt like a very low workload (no readings was great!). I also really liked reading the X themes each week and having a chance to look at other student work Weaknesses: the lectures often felt useless and were very dry, you could easily write the themes each week without attending or paying attention; experience in the course is very tutor-dependent"
98402,"The tutor system is for the most part excellent. Each student is paired with a tutor and has an hour per week to meet with that tutor and discuss the themes written the previous week. I had a fantastic tutor, and this made the course experience wonderful. I understand that some other students were not close with their tutors, and this could make it difficult. But I would guess that most of the tutors, like mine, are great. The fact that the course has no special final project or exam is also a strength, I think. But the lectures were definitely a weakness."
98402,"Strangths: Teaching fellows were superb and the use of student writings in the weekly handouts was a great way to motivate people.  Weaknesses: Lecture felt boring and unnecessary. I went to half the lectures, and when I was there I barely paid attention."
98402,"The strength is definitely the tutors and the structure of the course itself. Prof. Erhgood was definitely the weakness. It was clear he cared, but he didn't do a great job in lectures--he tended to drone and was not at all engaging."
98402,"The strength of this course is that it gives you time to practice writing, and that's invaluable. Tutor feedback varies significantly, so while some may be helpful, you cannot count on their feedback being at the level of feedback offered by any other Yale writing class. The biggest serious weakness I felt in this class is its lack of discrepancy regarding missed themes and extensions. In this class, late work = missed work. Beyond the allotted 5 skips and 3 late themes, you need a Dean's Extension for late work. This means that when life gets in the way, you need to think about whether your problem can be validated by a Dean within 24 hours to meet the deadline. For every theme you hand in late, you lose a third of the final grade for the class. Perhaps the allotted skips and late themes are designed for you to save for the whole semester until a disaster arises, although no one plans for that to happen and I don't feel that this was how they were advertised. When I became ill, a Dean's Extension didn't cover the entire time I was sick; in my case, while unwell, I grinded out the themes so that my grade wouldn't tank over the course of a single week. Because of the daily deadlines, after a semester of handing in themes, it would only take a week of illness to go from an A to a C+. In any other class, I'd be able to talk to my TF and work out a suitable schedule."
98402,"The biggest strength of the course is the writing tutors. If placed with a writing tutor that is a good match, the class can have a disproportionately large impact on your broader academic experience at Yale along with making the class enjoyable"
98402,Classes could focus more on content that isn't just on the handouts. Strengths are certainly the tutors which get to know each student individually and can provide very good critiques.
98402,"Strengths: I liked most of the prompts, I like that it's a consistent amount of work, most of the guest lectures were cool. Weaknesses: The lectures could ramble a lot and were sometimes hard to connect to the actual practice of writing. But they were generally good."
98402,"not many improvements necessary!  Strengths would be the overall format of the course-- I loved that it wasn't a traditional structure, I felt like I learned a lot from taking a class that's so interactive/incorporated in every day life, without the stress of exams!"
98402,"Strengths: You get to meet one-on-one every week with a writing tutor, who can encourage you when they recognize places where you have improved. You get to put 11*5*300 ~ 15 thousand words of your thoughts into a built-up collection. Your writing and thinking ability will probably improve because it truly becomes a routine. Weakness: your routine might be writing your themes at 3 am, 5 times a week."
98402,"Harriet Bergmann, my tutor for this course, was an absolute bright spot. This year, the course was incredibly technical, taking the joy out of the practice of writing every day. I found myself trying to fit the theme restrictions rather than writing for the sake of enjoying my writing. This is not to suggest that there can't be technical instruction in daily themes there should be but rather that the instructions were unclear and the weeks were repetitive in their prompts. Prof Ehrgood spent too long each class reading out the X themes and some of the excerpts rather than explaining why these things might fit what we're trying to achieve or what makes it a good literary device, for example."
98402,"The structure of the course is really good in theory. My main suggestion would be trying to adjust the way tutors are assigned. I appreciate that they were random -- I think the random assignments helped it feel less competitive and intimidating. However, my tutor and I were so different in terms of our interests, writing styles, and personalities that it made working together difficult, and I unfortunately did not get much out of the meetings. I know other students had really good experiences with my tutor, and I know of other tutors who I think I would have gotten along much better with. I wonder if there could be a system where students indicate certain genres or subjects they especially like to write, or even certain writers they particularly like. Then maybe tutors could indicate generally what genres or subjects they'd particularly like to teach. Even if the tutors could just request a few subjects they don't like teaching, it would help avoid situations like the one my tutor and I were in (where my favorite subject to write about was one of his least favorite to read). I'm sure it must be really difficult to assign tutors in a way that is fair and non-competitive, and I appreciate the benefit of being taught by a reader very different from your usual readers, but I think it would help a lot of students if there were a way to assign the tutors just a bit more deliberately, or at least to try to avoid particularly opposing pairings."
98438,Strength: the course format and structure and TAs were great. Weakness: Sometimes lectures were a bit disorganized or hard to follow.
98438,"Material in lecture was often covered quite quickly, but I found it easy to go back to lecture slides and catch up on things I missed because lecture materials were easily accessible. A huge strength of the course was the TAs, who were always willing to help out and answer questions."
98438,"Strengths: great TAs and helpful sections, interesting subject material, weaknesses: SO much material for each class that we would struggle to get through it all"
98438,"Great lecturer, superb teaching assistants. This is a great course!"
98438,The course manages to cover information in depth while also covering a wide range of information. No weaknesses!
98438,"Pretty low impact work-load wise. I felt that the lectures weren't the most useful, but I really enjoyed the sections."
98438,Lectures were very comprehensive and sections were very helpful in tying together the readings with the lectures.
98438,"The lectures moved very quickly and gave a lot of information, which was interesting. I did not mind the extra information, but I would have liked for the lectures to be more streamlined. The lectures often ran over time as well. The discussion sections were a highlight because the TAs explain everything well, but most students did not talk. And I really liked that I learned something new in every class and discussion section."
98438,"I thought lecture were interesting but had way too much information in the slides, so the professor would frequently go over time or have to skip slides. However, Professor Mares' passion and expertise shines through it all and I was glad that she taught this course. Overall, though, I think the TFs were the best part of this class. They were incredibly helpful in summarizing the readings and helping us engage with their arguments, which I found incredibly fascinating!"
98438,Great readings and section! Lot of material.
98438,"The first half of the course is very interesting, but the second half is a little scattered. I think the first half of the course could be dragged out across the entire semester, as there is too much content in it right now."
98438,"Well organized. Biggest strength was Alexander Trubowitz. If you have the choice, please take the class with him as the TAone of the best TAs Ive had at Yale."
98438,"Strengths: The discussion section was useful and added much to the experience. The material is really useful, and the readings are selected carefully. Weakness: only big weakness I can think of is the syllabus - the expectations were not set clearly ahead of time, and the syllabus is incomplete and lacks details about the technical side of the class."
98438,"I really enjoyed the content that this course offered, and there was a ton of interesting information in the lectures. That said, at times the pace of the lectures felt a little rushed to the point where we would sometimes skip over slides or only stay on them for a few seconds, which made them harder to follow. I also learned a lot from the readings, but some were a little overly technical given that the course didn't focus much on methodologies or statistical techniques."
98438,"The class was early in the morning, so recorded lectures would have been helpful."
98438,"The strengths are the content and the TFs. Although I had my doubts at first, once I finally got to learning the material I found it was pretty applicable and sensible, fun to learn. TFs were incredible. Weaknesses are lectures. Very dull."
98438,Amazing sections
98438,the presentation of information was disorganized. it was a shame because the content was very interesting
98438,"Strengths: very clear guidance for exams, interesting lectures  Weaknesses: Professor Mares' presenting style was occasionally difficult to follow during the lectures"
98438,Very well organized
98438,"The strengths of this course were definitely the discussion sections and the teaching fellows. They were super approachable, knowledgeable, and helpful to make sense of content that was sometimes confusing the first go around in lecture. A weakness was that the lectures were super dense and Professor Mares went through the many text-rich slides very rapidly with few asides. This made it difficult to stay fully engaged and understand what was the most important information from each lecture."
98438,Readings are too long- unmanageable so no one ends up doing them at all
98438,"Strengths: appropriate workload of weekly readings, Isabela is so kind and really knowledgeable. Great TAs. Lots of help for exams. Weaknesses: The lectures could have the key points bolded and takeaways repeated a few times, I think there was a lot of good detail in them but I would easily lose track of the main threads / theses of the presentations. This is a small thing but it could help a bit !"
98438,"Strengths: The course was structured brilliantly to facilitate the goals of the course. If you were able to go to all the lectures, you would first cover general principles, then look at the applications of those principles to case studies, then compare the case studies and look at outlier examples. It was amazing how everything in a very diverse set of course material tied together so well. Huge credit was down to the TAs (more below), who was arguably the best teaching fellow I have had the pleasure of learning under during my time at Yale. Improvements: I do think at times there was a lot of following with the course slides, which while useful for studying, meant that we never had enough time to cover all the material in the slides and would have to skip over the last few slides or go over lesson time. Additionally, I do think there was a lot of unnecessary detail not a problem in terms of enrichment, but it wouldve been great to have a clearer idea of what the core topics were (rather than finding out in preparation for an exam)."
98438,Very fast paced lectures and to me the content wasnt the most exciting thing.
98438,"Strengths: good prof, TAs were fantastic, interesting content Weaknesses: sometimes lecture slides felt a bit disorganized"
98457,"I strongly enjoyed this course and thought the blend of material was fantastic. I thought the problem sets were representative of the material covered in lecture. One comment was the midterm was a time crunch and everyone was struggling to finish it, I would have preferred more time and even not getting open notes as I felt I understood all of the material but didn't have time to demonstrate all of my knowledge. Overall it was a great course and was taught very well!"
98457,Strengths: well taught and coordinated  Weaknesses: N/A
98457,"The course was super well organized, lectures were engaging and covered the required content, and plenty of office hours were available. Exams were really stressful due to the time pressure even if you knew the content, but other than that I really enjoyed the course."
98457,"I think the low workload and the open everything exams are a major strength. It helped me focus on the important things about the course and, more particularly, on the things I personally found interesting. Prof. Oristaglio is always extremely helpful."
98457,"The grade distribution of this class is awesome. So many stem classes at Yale are SO exam heavy, so it is nice to have a class where that is deemphasized. Also psets being bi-weekly is a big plus in my opinion. The time constraint of the midterm felt like a weakness, but it is understandable given exams are open book, open note without some cap you could brute-force your way towards anything."
98457,"I really liked the optional asynchronous format and I think it was done better than most other classes were during covid. I think the material struck a good balance of breadth and depth, and even the random technical sidebars felt pretty relevant to understanding the topics at hand."
98457,Strengths: Lectures were pretty interesting. They were also all recorded and Zoom attendance was not penalized. Office hours were very helpful. P-sets were relevant and doable; exams were more challenging but not insanely so. Weaknesses: Sometimes the survey of existing energy projects for every energy type felt a little too exhaustive/not particularly helpful for student understanding.
98457,"Strengths: Course materials (including slides) are amazing, with clear thought and care put into them (formatting, content, clarity, visuals, etc.). Topics covered are comprehensive of renewable energy, and both qualitative/quantitative aspects mesh well together (not exceedingly difficult and easily grasped by anyone with some math and basic physics background). All logistics aspects of the course are extremely generous (maybe too generous, but cant complain): incentive-based attendance policy, grace period on all problem sets, and flexible/online exam times w/ open notes. Professor Oristaglio is an amazing educator, and he makes great effort to structure the course in a way thats conducive to student learning and success, better than just about any other course at Yale.  Weaknesses: Some lectures are jam-packed with information. Both the midterm and final exam are not too rigorous in content but difficult to complete in the allotted time. Flexibility can lead to need for students to put in extra effort to stay on top of things (easy to fall behind)."
98457,"The workload is very low (1 pset every 2 weeks), but the exams are challenging. Oristaglio does not teach the quantitative content that is examined and instead expects students to look over example quantitative problems in the slides in their own time. He could do a better job of teaching the content that will be examined instead if rushing through slideshows that contain way too much content for one lecture."
98457,"The workload of this class is really light, but I think there are easier science classes to take (if youre not interested in renewable energy). Especially if you dont have a good background in physics, I could see this class being pretty challenging conceptually."
98457,"Strengths: pset every two weeks Weaknesses: prof is a really nice person and super available to help students, however he tends to be quite boring. he explains too many physics concepts all in one lecture without delving deep into any of them. Id rather have learned fewer concepts but understanding them better. There was not much practice material for the exams and OH were rare and at unconvenient times"
98457,interesting but very science heavy. connecting it back to the real world consequences would be helpful perhaps with engagement!
98457,More interactive lectures but super informative and great course overall
98457,"The presentations arent great, and the assessments are extremely difficult"
98457,"Strengths: Professor Oristaglio is an amazing lecturer! He offers frequent office hours and field trips, which are definitely the highlights of this course! The exams are very low-stress since they are all open book and internet.   Weakness: the first unit can be especially daunting for students who havent taken a proper physics class before (the first problem set scared away many of my friends who were enrolled in this class), but the material definitely became more digestible from then on."
98457,Tons of information packed into lectures; I think it could be helpful to make the information more cumulative and less scattered.
98457,"Strength: lots of information; Oristaglio is super knowledgeable, very nice, and genuinely interested in making sure people learn about energy; has provisions for online learning; lecture slides are well-organized Weaknesses: there is a lot of information to learn and the midterm can overestimate how much you know and how much time it takes you to answer questions about it"
98457,"I took this class as a semi-gut, and was surprised to find the content very interesting. There's about a 50-50 split between theoretical and statistical information (what countries are trying to break new ground in solar energy, why does india use so much biofuel, what are the sources of greenhouse gas emissions in detail, etc), and the rest is on calculations. The physics part of the class was very boring and poorly taught, but the intuition side was very interesting."
98457,"Strengths: content very well organized, there are always slides and handouts to help you with material  Weaknesses: there are sometimes inconsistencies / lack of clarity with the grading system."
98457,"This course is very interesting lecture wise, but there's a lot that I miss in class that the slides don't cover. The material of this course has a wide breadth but also covers a wide depth, which makes it hard to fully grasp everything. Additionally, for problem sets or exams, sometimes they'll take off points because you didn't mention something that they wanted to see, even if they didn't ask for the detail correctly."
98457,"This class is a smattering of a ton of different topics in energy - economics, science, engineering, etc. sometimes its quite unsatisfying to be just scratching the surface of each of them, but its also cool to get to discuss so many things."
98457,"Strengths: Professor Oristaglio was extremely engaged in the class--field trips, lots of office hours, etc. Interesting lectures. Slides were very helpful to study. Problem sets very helpful to study. Very clear presentation of material. Quick grading of problem sets. Weaknesses: We did spend a lot of time reading of of slides--I think lecturing without the slides, and posting the slides after as study material, would be cool"
98457,"strengths: professor oristaglio was super kind, patient and accommodating. he explained his concepts clearly  weaknesses: guest lecturer could have explained concepts more clearly."
98457,"Well structured, you have a clear idea of what the course is doing, where it's going etc, generally clear about what it wants you to learn (sometimes a little less clear about what will be assessed though this very well good be a pedagogical choice I suspect). Isn't too ambitious but I think is also beginner friendly enough. I think you'll quite quickly realise what you will get out of taking this course within the first few lessons. Psets prepared you reasonably well for the midterms and finals, thought they were well set in terms of difficulty, nice mix of easy, doable and challenging. Do wonder about the grade distribution. Understand there's a conditional curve that's applied to the class. Would be interesting to see what the final distribution for the whole class will be like."
98457,"Flexibility of lectures and exams are strengths, as well as material covered in lectures. No weaknesses"
98457,"Strengths: organized, engaging lecturers, well-supported with lots of office hours, field trips offered but not mandatory Weaknesses: nothing major! some lecturers were rushed and a lot of concepts were thrown at students quickly, but overall not bad"
98457,"The lectures for the course were quite good, although they sometimes felt a little bit long. One definite strength was the field trips, which were a lot of fun and very informative."
98457,Very thorough course covering both the equations and policies of renewables.
98457,The midterm and final were unnecessarily time crunched in such a way that the exams felt like they were testing how fast you could do math rather than your acknowledge if the content. The PSETS were very fair though and with office hours help can boost your grade
98457,Nice professor. Straight forward PSETs and tests.
98475,Fantastic lectures
98475,"The lectures were incredible, easily some of my favorite during my time at Yale. The lecture hall would often be silent for a few seconds after the end of class as we all hurried to complete our handwritten notes. I appreciated that people were all taking notes by hand and not distracted by phones -- it helped me stay focused, and I had to be judicious in what material I could take down. That said, beyond the lectures, I didn't feel like I got a ton out of the class in discussion sections or our exams. It felt like the kind of course where you get out what you put in -- the lectures are a great foundation, but I'm not sure how much I'll actually remember in a few years given how dense many of the readings were. I'd prefer a shorter reading list and a consensus in discussion section that we'd all gotten through the readings. Instead, there were so many assigned readings that our conversations stayed surface-level since so few people had done the same selection."
98475,"The lectures were truly excellent, engaging and informative, and the readings were mostly very good, though towards the end of the class they began to lack variety and become increasingly irrelevant to the content of lectures. The actual graded content of the class was another story; teaching fellows often seemed to have no idea of what role they were expected to play, and could answer few questions, regarding the content or course logistics more generally, unless those answers had already been provided in class. The lack of clarity regarding graded work consistently left students scrambling at the last minute, whether to study content with which they had limited familiarity or to complete assignments whose parameters they had previously misunderstood."
98475,Prof isn't very accessible but the course is extremely well taught and deeply interesting.
98475,Amazing class. Snyder is such a fantastic lecturer. The information was clear and the exams felt very fair. I learned so much and enjoyed going to class.
98475,"super interesting course, lectures were phenomenal, readings supplemented lectures well, discussion section was good"
98475,"I loved the outline and key terms handouts given at the start of each lecture as they were very helpful in knowing what the important points of the lecture were and made the lecture easier to follow, although Professor Snyder is pretty clear as is. Professor Snyder also makes the course incredibly interesting and is so skillful at tying together main themes and events across time. I also liked the country by country organization of the course as it allowed you to really see what struggles the country went through and its ideological development process over time. A weakness of the course is the sheer amount of reading that is assigned on a weekly basis, which was sometimes uneven across weeks. Some weeks had 400+ pages books plus readings from the course packet which seemed kind of unnecessary. Nevertheless, I think you really only need them for the chronology (which will creep up on you) and the discussion sections, although you should also know a handful so you can name drop them in the exams. They do help your understanding of the lecture material, but often times Professor Snyder fills you in a bit enough so you can follow along. One thing that I disliked, although it sounded nice in theory, was having lectures outside. The weather was nice but it was just so uncomfortable to take notes on the floor and it was quite difficult to hear."
98475,Strength is Professor Snyder. no weakness.
98475,Strenghts - Snyder is a phenomenal lecturer. Every class feels like a movie. Weakness - the chronology is a bit of a pain and feels slightly useless. I think I'd prefer writing a paper that challenged some of the ideas I learned and notions more than simply selecting dates and justifying them
98475,"Strengths: Professor Snyders lectures are AMAZING. Theyre jam packed with information, but extremely riveting throughout. Similarly, the course work is doable. There was a midterm and final which were easier than I expected. They arent multiple choice type, so just focus on truly grasping the material.  Weakness: The only one I can think of is too much reading. But, think about it like this you dont have to do all the reading to do well. So, dont let this stop you from taking the course. Do what you can and you should be fine!"
98475,"Snyder's lecture style is incredible--at the end of each class, I often felt a needed to take a moment to reflect on the whirlwind of everything that I'd learned. Given his preeminent status though, he was pretty difficult to get in contact with and did not have much of a chance to build a personal rapport with students (not many office hours)  I liked the chronology assignment, but did not feel that the exam assessment format was the most conducive to understanding the history of this region in the comprehensive way that snyder desired (perhaps essays would be better)"
98475,Snyder lectures without presentations and talks somewhat quietly: the difficulty of following him and absorbing the onslaught of information is the only weakness of the course. Everything else is near perfect.
98475,"Strengths: very good at keeping me engaged, very energic and interesting lectures.  Cons:sometimes hard to hear"
98475,"Strengths: - Professor Synder's lectures were incredible. He does such a good job of covering the material in an interesting way.  - The guest lecturers were amazing as well. I particularly enjoyed the two lectures that Professor Shore covered. - The material itself is incredibly important. It can be difficult to create a course for a survey class when the subject matter is so broad, but I think that the syllabus was well-curated to gain a good understanding of the entire region.   Weaknesses: - The readings for certain periods were quite dense while other periods felt light. It was hard to keep up with the readings throughout the semester, especially when some lectures asked us to finish entire books.  - Section was incredibly hit or miss. I heard from some other students with a different section leader that they were able to learn a lot from section, but my section was terrible for most of the semester. My section leader left 2/3 of the way through the semester, and even the first 2/3 that she was there for, she gave very little valuable input. We had to rely on ourselves to talk about important dates and events, and she never corrected us even if we said misleading information."
98475,"Strengths: all the readings are selected carefully and are really important (please do them!); overall, the material is extremely interesting and important, especially for any humanities/social science major. Professor Snyder is my best lecturer so far - when he talks, you can't stop listening. Weaknesses: technology:// PDF reading packet had all the readings without any numeration, making it hard to look for readings every time. Also, I personally lacked writing papers, which I think could add a lot to the experience. There is one big final assignment (chronology) - please start writing it as early as possible!! Trust me.  Workload is also really high - not necessarily a weakness, but be aware of it."
98475,"Lectures, readings, assignments were all strengths. No weakness."
98475,"Strengths: extremely relevant topic, very knowledgable professor, topics and ideas that matter for other parts of the world (democracy, freedom of speech, autarky, socialism, foreign policy, etc), interesting lectures. Weaknesses: the reading can be a little overwhelming - but don't look at it as an ""either/or"" kind of thing; you gain a lot from doing the readings even if you do 70% instead of 100% (and the lectures really are more engaging if you come in prepared) so don't give up. Also, not a weakness in my eyes, but less focus on Russia than I would've thought."
98475,"Strengths: Snyder is a brilliant lecturer, by far the best set of survey lectures I had at Yale. There are also handouts given out every lecture outlining the day's material, which are great resources for note-taking + studying for exams.   Weaknesses: Not a weakness, but this is a survey course covering 100 years of history in a major region of the world, so the bigger picture is usually emphasized over going into depth in any one particular area."
98475,Strengths: Prof. Snyder is an incredible lecturer and the readings were quite interesting. Weaknesses: the exams were poorly structured and required lots of memorization.
98475,Timothy Snyder is an amazing lecturer.  Way too much reading that is often unenforceable
98475,Amazing course. No faults
98475,Strengths are Snyders lectures and also the TFs  The weaknesses are thst sometimes the chronology and readings seem like busy work
98475,"strengths: engaging, relevant, thought-provoking, challenging, interesting weaknesses: n/a"
98475,"The strength of this class is definitely in Professor Snyder--he does a great job of explaining some of the most important events that shape Eastern Europe throughout the last 100 years, and his lectures are always interesting to listen to. Sections are a bit dull overall though."
98475,The lectures are great but the readings are quite long. The course organization wasn't great at the beginning but it got better as the course progressed. It would be good if some of the most important readings were highlighted. Exams are fair and the final chronology is interesting.
98475,The strengths are the professor! The weakness is the amount of reading that is expected of the student.
98475,"I though the TAs were a little disconnected from the professor and each other, with different grading policies occasionally"
98475,"There are paper handouts given before each lecture that have key terms, events, and people, which was useful when studying for exams. However, often times not all of these terms would come up during lecture. Additionally, to people who are not familiar with these Eastern European languages, these names when spoken out loud can be pretty confusing. I think that simply repeating each name slowly a second time would really help some students like myself get it down and find it in the paper handouts."
98475,"The course was well-taught and had insightful texts well worth the read, but not a lot of challenging assignments (would have liked an essay or two) and a little too much focus on memorizing dates and people."
98475,Good
98475,"Strengths: Prof. Snyder is an incredible lecturer, and he simply feeds you a narrative in a beautiful way that makes lectures fly by. The first half of the course in particular helped me think about this period I thought I was familiar with in a new way.  Weaknesses: the timeline assignment at the end of the semester felt really unnecessary. Some of the readings are unnecessarily dense and don't get discussed in lecture. The second half of the course was not very well organized."
98475,"Engaging material, interesting lectures, great professor. Could improve: more specificity on what exam will be beforehand."
98475,Strengths - very interesting lectures and material Weaknesses - syllabus very unclear
98475,Professor Snyder is an INCREDIBLE lecturer
98475,"Professor Snyder's lectures are engaging. However, it can be difficult to hear him if you are not near the front of the lecture hall or someone is talking nearby. If he had a better microphone, this issue would be fixed."
98475,"I loved this class. Professor Snyder is an incredible lecturer, super organized and compelling to listen to. The exams were scary to study for, but were a great opportunity to showcase what we had learned and never ended up being too challenging (maybe they were slightly too long for a 50 minute time slot). There was a LOT of reading for this class, and I thought it was a little impossible to actually complete it all, but I never felt that any of it was busy work, which I appreciated."
98475,"Strengths: This course is great for anyone wanting to learn more about Eastern Europe's modern history or to expand their knowledge. Background knowledge can be helpful but not necessary. The lectures are great and discussion sections are usually helpful in reviewing content.   Weaknesses: There are a lot of readings, which aren't necessary for tests but are necessary for the final chronology. It's recommended to start the chronology early because it's a very long assignment."
98475,"Strengths: Great professor, engaging and interesting lectures, and assignments that apply knowledge Weaknesses: Unmanageable reading load"
98475,"The course material is fascinating, and the subjects described are important to the region. Everything we learned felt important in one way or another. Guest lectures were especially strong, and hearing different perspectives was valuable. The workload in terms of reading, however, felt very high for an introductory course."
98475,"Strengths: prof snyders lectures are just phenomenal. The subject matter is fascinating. Weaknesses: too much reading - disincentivizes doing any or much of it. Also prof Snyder - though one of the best lecturers I have had - should give some more advanced thought about lecture organization and signposting. Even with the outlines, it was sometimes difficult to follow the flow of the lecture."
98475,"Professor Snyder delivers his lectures in a terse and fluent manner. I am often shocked by the amount of historical detail he covers in a 50 minute lecture when I look at my notes. His readings are pretty interesting as well.  I hoped for more readings on the Soviet Union in the post-Stalin era. What were the circumstances in which Kruschchev, Brehznev, and Gorbachev rose to power?"
98475,I feel that the teacher knows the material well but for someone just jumping into the subject there's not really a way to be eased in without some prior knowledge.
98475,"Professor Snyder is an excellent lecturer, as is Professor Shore, who gave a couple lectures throughout the class. The readings are interesting, but there is quite a lot of it. Almost every aspect of the class is excellent with just one glaring weakness. Having the readings on that one pdf is incredibly inconvenient, and I certainly would have done a larger proportion of the reading if it had been easier to access. Every other class I have taken at Yale has had the readings organized on Canvas and broken down by week. As if it weren't frustrating enough to have to scroll to the exact spot in the packet, the readings are sometimes out of order or don't match the syllabus--it's at least one year out of date. Surely it's worth the effort for somebody to break the reading into separate files and organize them by week on Canvas compared to the time spent by every single student in the class to have to look through the giant packet to find the correct reading every time."
98475,Excessive amount of reading. TA giving different deadlines for course projects creating a unfair environment
98499,"I loved the readings. This is the only class that I've ever done all of the readings for in my entire Yale career. The lectures complement the reading well, and I enjoyed sections. The papers were fun to write and there were lots of options to choose from."
98499,"really interesting class, even though i am a stem major"
98499,"Strengths: Professor Freedman knows a lot about food. I also appreciated the freedom and flexibility given with the papers, which allowed students to follow their interests. Guest lecturers were super interesting and diverse, and really added to the course.  Weaknesses: I feel like a class called ""History of Food"" could have been a lot more interesting. Lectures are optional, which sometimes makes it hard to feel like what you're learning in class is important at all."
98499,Information was interesting and easy to understand.
98499,Very laid back course which also teaches you a lot about a topic not normally discussed within the classroom.
98499,"Strengths - very interesting material, Freedman is fantastic lecturer, interesting material, relevant, useful, papers are fun to write. Weaknesses - while my TF was great, sometimes it felt like there was nothing to do in section and it was busy work for everyone just to ""check that box"""
98499,"A strength is the wide range of topics that are covered, including societal issues and environmental ones. A weakness is that the lecture slides aren't detailed and they mainly show images without a caption, which makes it difficult to use the lecture slides when studying for exams."
98499,Great class
98499,It is hard to emcompass the food history of entire countries and I found it difficult to follow that portion of the class.
98499,"Strengths: interesting lectures, not a lot of reading required Weaknesses: none"
98499,"strengths: Prof. Freedman is an amazing lecturer and the class is interesting if you are interested in food. We also had very good guest lecturers that discussed interesting topics. The TFs are also a great source for writing the papers. Weeknesses: the class can sometimes be boring, specially at the start of the semester."
98499,None
98499,"No weaknesses. Well organized with a manageable workload. Both the teaching fellows at Prof. Freedman, himself, seemed pretty approachable. Lectures were engaging as were section."
98499,Interesting class and did not require background knowledge to follow along and stay connected with the class.
98499,"Super interesting course material and really fun discussion sections! Loved the format of the papers, and the exams were reasonable easy.  The lectures were good but I think the slides could have been a tad more engaging, although Prof. Freedman is a great speaker. Have to be honest, I didn't do any of the readings, though, and I don't think I missed much."
98499,"Very good, interesting lectures. Professor Freedman clearly cares about the topic and he is a very good lecturer. I wish some of the notes would be posted online, but in general, I really enjoyed the course."
98499,I enjoyed Professor Freedman's style of lecture and thought the information presented was most interesting.
98499,"Professor Freedman is a very engaging lecturer and I appreciated the selection of topics. I also found the TAs to be wonderful in this class, and the ability to virtually attend lecture was extremely helpful during busy times.   As far as weaknesses, it is overall a very strong course. I think having structured materials would be useful for studying purposes, as the slides are mostly images, so it can be hard to keep track of what to study from each section. Maybe just a midterm and final sheet of big topics to focus on would be good, I felt a bit lost studying so I just tried to reread everything, which was probably not the most efficient use of time."
98499,"The strengths of the course are Professor Freedman's lecturing style as well as the breadth of food topics that we covered (different cuisines, restaurants, and its relation to religion, race, class, gender, etc.)it felt really comprehensive. The weaknesses of this course are perhaps the ambiguity in grading and maybe the presentation slides could have had more information on them to make it easier to follow."
98499,"I think this is a fine course for getting an introduction to the material, and there arent a ton of food specific classes at yale so i think this is a good start. I think some topics were more engaging than others and since we moved from one to the next so quickly sometimes it didnt feel like much more than surface level info was sticking. I think this class did the best for what it is, but sometimes it was sad that our section discussions were pretty surface level and not engaging, but yet section was mandatory every week. I also thought some of the guest speakers werent that interesting."
98499,"This is a fun course that also taught me quite a bit about food in the United States over the past century. The course does cover food around the world at a very basic level. More depth about the history of food outside the US would be ideal, though covering that content in greater detail might be difficult given the semester time constraint."
98499,"The large lecture format with smaller discussion sections worked for this course, and the recorded lectures allowed for me to stay connected with this course despite having trouble making it to class."
98499,"Strengths: Prof. Freedman is a gem. An old-school professor whose lectures are filled with humor and self-awareness. Great lecturer, you can tell he's practiced a lot which makes for a very fluid delivery of information. Take a chance to meet with him outside of class, he is a pleasure to speak with and he has real interest in students' thoughts on matters related to and unrelated to this course's material  weaknesses: none"
98499,Only complaint would be the lectures could be a little boring sometimes
98499,"The class is well structured, covers a lot of topics with a good level of detail and is quite relaxed, and friendly to non-history students."
98499,It would be better if the lectures were more organized. Some texts on PowerPoints would help instead of having images only.
98499,"Strengths: Clear reading, great professor, interesting guest lecturers, fun section"
98499,strengths - I liked Professor Freedman's teaching style and also enjoyed having occasional guest lecturers. I also liked the way the course was organized by region and year and how it took us through decades of historical landmarks that contributed to why food is preferred in some places and how spices/etc got to others. weakness - I would have liked more notes on the PowerPoint slides other than pictures and thought the class could have been more engaging in the historical sense of detailing more about specific cultures instead of only spending one class on each region
98499,"More clear instructions on reading materials, it was sometimes hard to find the articles. More clear what was expected of us through the readings."
98499,Strengths: the course is very engaging and the content is super cool. Weaknesses: none
98499,It spends way too long talking about race & individual food items I think the food reform movements & the spice trade were the best parts of the class and I wouldve loved to have spent more time on them.
98499,Lecture is very engaging and interesting. Section was also very well lead.
98499,"Strengths of this course is that Professor Freedman is a good and engaging lecturer. The course is also well structured, but I wish we could've gone more in depth of each topic."
98499,I think the lectures were really interesting and the guest lectures really kept me engaged throughout the semester.
98499,Awesome professor and good outline  Sections should maybe have more guided questions
98499,"The big lecture format stifled the potential of this course. The lecture hall is also so big. It is usually only about 20% full.  Professor Freedman, however, is a great lecturer. I have immense respect for him because he is an expert of Medieval history but nonetheless is so knowledgeable about food history."
98499,Lectures are slightly disengaging/boring. Could be revamped to engage the students more.
98499,This course was very interesting although at times the lecture felt a bit long.
98499,"i really liked the lectures, professor freedman is very knowledgeable and a great lecturer"
98499,The recorded lectures help for classes that have to be missed. Professor Freedman is an incredible lecturer.
98499,Really good content and I actually appreciated writing the essays - were very helpful to dive into the material.
98499,"Strengths: Provides a very broad overview of all of food history before focusing on Modern America. I really enjoyed the open-endedness of the essay prompts because I was able to write very interesting pieces I wouldn't get the chance to write in other courses.  Weaknesses: I think this course should be broken into multiple courses. There is simply too much history here for it to be one course. I would love to see ""History of Restaurants"" for example. I want to dive more deeply into the course material, but the lens of this course is simply too broad to facilitate this."
98499,"No weaknesses. The class lectures were well-structured, thus facilitating better learning."
98499,"The lectures were not the most engaging and the planning of the course didn't seem that connected/structured. However, the topics were interesting and hard to come by. I liked hearing about different ingredients and dishes but they were always just mentioned and not discussed."
98499,"Strengths: Prof Freedman was very passionate about the course, and clearly very knowledgeable about the material. All of the TA's seemed very dedicated. I also appreciated the chance to hear from guest lecturers.  Weaknesses: The lectures felt a bit disorganized at times, which made it hard to stay focused during class. Expectations for the content of the essays (especially the first one) was quite vague. I would have appreciated more specifics about what was expected."
98499,Discussions were thought provoking and assignments were easy yet engaging.
98499,I thought it was great how the class moved in mostly chronological order which made it easier to keep track of the progression of food throughout history
98511,Strengths - Latham is an outstanding professor and speaker. The course is well organized and balanced in workload. The readings all feel relevant and interesting.  Weaknesses - The timing of the midterms felt off both times.
98511,"The section for this class was amazing. Lots of great discussions. The lectures were good, but it was apparent that the course was relatively new due to some of the organizational changes. Will definitely improve over time."
98511,I found that the assigned readings often did not present rigorous philosophy or get much into theory. I also found the lectures generally uninsightful and at times repetitive between weeks. They seemed generally as if they were not at all prepared in advance. The course readings were also quite disorganized. It was difficult to know which were assigned because the syllabus and folders did not match up.
98511,"The lectures are very compelling, and the discussion sections are productive. The only weakness I see in this class is that the lectures and readings are redundant to one another. There is too much overlap between the two. I think this class would be more effective if the readings and lectures covered different aspects and examples of their shared topic rather than them both diving into the same things."
98511,"Weaknesses: this class approaches environmental ethics from a western philosophy lens, and only sways from that for one week when the readings focus on ecofeminism, racial environmental justice, and indigenous environmentalism. It is void of the storytelling that makes Professor Latham's other classes so interesting, and does not cast a very wide net, nor does it provide nuanced solutions or insight into age-old environmental issues."
98511,"The lectures were very boring and disorganized, never any notes or slides. It was hard to know what would be important for exams. 1h15min felt like way too long, and it often felt like Prof. Latham was running out of things to say and just trying to fill the time. It's easy enough to do well without going to lecture, which is nice, but I'm disappointed that I didn't feel like I learned anything. Also, this class was very narrow in its scope. We mostly read the perspectives of white western men, even though there's a vast literature of indigenous and ecofeminist work we could draw from. The one lecture about ecofeminism was cancelled, and the material wasn't on the exam, which made it feel like Prof Latham didn't take that area of study seriously."
98511,- engaging lecture
98511,"strengths: Professor Latham always brought interesting topics to discuss in class. Also, the readings were super interesting and I looked forward to them every week weakness: I thought there could have been better engagement in lectures (attendance was poor, but I made an effort to attend every class because I genuinely enjoyed the class). I also felt like sometimes the class was a bit unorganized (would have loved a picture or notes on the board instead of a straight lecture)"
98511,"Strengths:  Professor Latham is a great lecturer and incorporates relevant real world examples to each concept  Good grounding in Western philosophy  Works great as an introduction to ethics for EVST/EPS students / an introduction to environmental topics for ethics majors  Interesting readings that are manageable  Responsive TAs that make an effort to help out students  Really good, relevant range of topics discussed  The exams reflected the course content well and had no surprises  Professor Latham was great at fielding questions from students  It's clear looking at last year's content and this year's that Prof Latham made an effort to change/improve the class and he was clearly committed to improving it  Weaknesses:  I think this course should ground students in inequities in environmentalism first before diving into each topic so students begin with that lens in their tool kit as opposed to learning about feminist and Indigenous perspectives after the second midterm. This is especially important for students who might not be aware of environmental inequalities or discrimination. Having those readings to reference later when considering things like geoengineering and obligations to future generations would be so much more useful and add a lot of depth to the discussion  Including William Cronon's ""The Trouble With Wilderness"" as a reading would help when discussing anthropocentrism/non-anthropocentrism and ideas of preservation/conservation  I think the reading responses should count for 10% of the course grade. It's a great way to measure participation and reward students for the work they're putting into the class beyond six hours of exam time."
98511,"The midterms and final are heavily weighted but if you stay engaged in the lecture, you should be okay."
98511,"Better attendance by classmates (perhaps with a participation grade structure?). It was not fair to the professor nor the better engaged students to have only half the class show up on a given class day. I greatly appreciate the recorded lectures, but in-class participation is key to this type of material. The more voices the better."
98511,"Although the content was interesting and complex, I struggled to develop my own critical thinking and nuanced perspective for the exams. I wish there was more emphasis on how we can imagine and critique the philosophies rather than just what the philosophers thought."
98511,Timed essay exams should not be handwritten. Maybe eliminate the timed portion altogether and make regular essays the primary assignments.
98511,"Too many topics, not enough information"
98511,Strengths: very interesting topic. Weaknesses: lecture is rather unengaging (especially because it was at 9 am when I took it). Theres really no engagement except for a bombardment of readings that the professor then briefly talks about during lecture.
98511,"I liked the syllabus in that the readings and topics were all good, but it could have been more neatly tied together and engagingly organized."
98511,"Strength: the lectures are very engaging, and the coursework is very manageable. The exam questions are somewhat predictable, so this course is relatively low-stress.   Weaknesses: the instructions for the weekly readings can at times be a little bit confusing and unclear."
98511,"Strengths: This course covered a good bit of ground in terms of connecting some foundational ethical theory to specific topics. The start of the course was really helpful in forming that ethical basis, and these were some of the most informative weeks that forced me to learn to think in a new way beyond just applying intuitive thinking. TFs were really nice and accessible, and Professor Latham has a wealth of knowledge. Readings werent too long and were helpful. Reading the Land Ethic and arguments of important philosophers like Singer was a good aspect of the texts. Weaknesses: Sometimes lectures felt a little bit like a list of fun facts or conflicting arguments than a comprehensive summary of the debate over specific ethical issues. There was definitely room to be more technical in terms of interpreting environmental events through a specifically ethical, rather than just general right-or-wrong, lens, and more technical mechanisms of things like geoengineering would have been helpful to see as well. I think this may be limited by the cross-listing policy, but this class would be stronger with more philosophy student TFs, as non-philosophy majors taking the course tend toward ways of thinking that already fall in line with environmentalist critiques we are already aware of. More specific readings on Kantianism would have been good to better establish the reasoning behind such a dominant philosophy of environmentalism as it exists."
98511,Weakness was that this wasnt a class for the instructor since most of the stuff was new to him as well
98511,"Strengths: This course covers a lot about environmental ethics, good for someone interested in ethics or the environmental field.   Weaknesses: Lectures could drag on, especially since they were early in the morning and we spent a lot of time repeating certain topics. I think the course could be improved if lectures were shortened to 50 minutes."
98511,This course was organized well in that the readings were well supported by the lectures and discussion sections.
98511,"This course presents many interesting subjects regarding environmental ethics and I think that the order in which the different topics are presented works well. I do wish that there was more of a variety of assignments besides the weekly reading responses and the midterms. I think that it would help student engagement if, for some of the topics, students had assignments that would allow them to explore more deeply how the content studied is relevant in the world (besides what is talked about in the readings and during class). I also think that if the class time was clearly structured with the first 30 or 40 minutes being lecture and the rest being discussion, students would feel more inclined to participate. Also, I wish that there was more focus on learning how to write a philosophical argument because that is a large part of the midterms and finals. It would be nice to analyze the techniques of writers from the readings and what makes their argument effective or ineffective."
98511,The readings were interesting and helpful to learning and section was beneficial.
98511,"This course is phenomenal as is, the only change Id consider is maybe adding a participation component so more people would actually come to lecture."
98511,"The strength of the class are the topics and the themes themselves. The weaknesses are that it does not feel very intro-friendly since our only grades are philosophical arguments which we do not touch upon in class. Also, the lectures could be a bit more interesting by having slides. Finally, there should be some other form of grades besides just exams: for instance, for our participation or weekly discussion section."
98511,"Very interesting material. Overall, intriguing class."
98511,Poorly organized
98511,"The course is overall fine, but structurally/organizationally could use some work. The latter half of the course is very interesting, and the first half of the course is necessary to understand the second half of the course, but the first half of the course is pretty abstract, and it would be worth considering how to make the first part of the course more engaging."
98511,"This class was so interesting and really built up arguments and understanding from the ground up. Class was spent talking through readings and explaining different sides of arguments. I really enjoyed section as well, and students were quite engaged with the conversation. Lecture never had slides, which was nice for some, but also could have been helpful for others. Some of the readings were a bit long and tedious, but most were interesting. I think there could have been more application of the material to other debates or projects."
98511,Strength: every week I was learning something new and considering perspectives I had never considered before. very engaging and deals with wide variety of topics Weaknesses: some weeks we would talk about the same concept/topic as was introduced previously. maybe finding more topics to cover or more different points would be helpful
98519,"This was the first time teaching this course as a seminar, and while Professor Wargo has many great things to say, it took a while for the class to find a balance between his speaking and discussion/collaboration. It will likely go smoother next year!"
98519,"Strengths: interesting material, very knowledgeable professor, understanding deadlines, reasonable workload Weaknesses: While Prof. Wargo definitely made efforts, the class at times still felt like a small lecture rather than a seminar (this is the first year it is a seminar, though, so it is an understandable transition)"
98519,"Strengths: The course readings were highly engaging, the course presented an excellent sample of both domestic and international environmental cases, and the final paper was both a great opportunity to apply lessons for the case studies to an area of personal interest, and was very well structured to promote intensive research.  Weaknesses: The class may benefit from being 20min shorter and/or having more clearly defined sections of lecture-style and seminar-style working"
98519,"Strengths: professor Wargo is an expert in the field and it's great to learn from him! The readings are super interesting and very relevant, the cases we study as well. I came in already with an environmental interest and learned so much each week.   Weaknesses: sometimes it took a while to get advice on paper progress but that's understandable. I wish this class was broken into two times a week because the one day a week sometimes was a bit long"
98519,"This course was very helpful for teaching how to write from a legal perspective, which I originally found daunting. I love how we were able to write about and dive into whatever environmental case interested us."
98519,"I enjoyed the mix of the lecture and seminar format, I think it was much more engaging than a typical lecture because there were less people. I also enjoyed the difficult questions that we were asked, though we obviously could not find the solutions it was a thought-provoking task. I also enjoyed the readings we did as they were very informative before we discussed the topics in class. My only recommendation is that I was hoping to see more discussion of Southeast Asia or countries outside the Western world since it was outlined in the syllabus."
98519,"I liked that the course was such a broad introduction to a variety of issues and that the class was a combination of a lecture and seminar discussion. Breaking into small groups to come up with potential solutions was very engaging and enriching. Sometimes the lectures dragged on and it wasn't clear where the class was heading, but they were always interesting."
98519,"strengths-- in depth readings each week and guidance on essay, availability of prof. wargo to talk. weaknesses-- course did not build on itself because each week was different. minimal student engagement during class time. slow to give essay feedback, arrived too late"
98519,"This course, in concept, works very well as a seminar. In practice, however, the professor ended up doing most of the talking, and I wish there had been more discussion between students. I learned a comprehensive overview of environmental problems, but little time was spent learning about effective solutions. I wish this class had been more hope-oriented."
98519,Covered a lot of real world environmental challenges and worked to develop critical thinking and knowledge in these important areas.
98519,The strengths of this course were the collaborative discussion that occurred each class meeting. Students always brought thoughtful insights and I found I learned just as much from discussion as I did from the readings and lecture.
98527,The lectures are slightly boring
98527,This class presented a lot of information and it was hard to discern what was actually meaningful to know.
98527,Strength: recorded lecture that I can always go back and learn. Information is very easy to understand as an undergrad with limited experience to the science behind climate change.   Weakness: can be less engaging since it is a lecture-based course.
98527,I think this class could go more in depth with having us actually do some climate modeling
98527,BORING AND NOT ACCESSIBLE TO NON-STEM STUDENTS
98527,"This course provides a great overview of climate change issues, such as albedo, carbon cycles, etc."
98527,"The assignments of this course are organized well, with the problem sets in the first half of the term helping you to learn the information that will be explored in the second half of the term. I enjoyed the literature critiques and how all the assignments are short and to the point."
98527,interesting lectures but a bit too many topics covered
98527,Strengths: knowledgeable professors. Weaknesses: unengaging lectures that are not clear. The lectures were also too long in my opinion.
98527,I felt like this course was a bit all over the place. At the beginning of the class there was a great deal of material being thrown at us and nobody really seemed to be confident in the material as the psets were very misaligned from what we were learning in lecture. After the first midterm there was no reason to go to lecture besides from personal enjoyment as there was again no application of lecture material to the assignments.
98527,It was pretty boring and a lot of the content went over my head because the lectures were pretty stupidly put together in my opinion - as in the just threw stuff on the slides and kinda said that. Like the guest speakers were often much clearer and interesting.
98527,Lectures can be too information heavy sometimes
98527,"The guest lecturers are engaging, and the course gives a comprehensive view of modern climate science. Sometimes the material feels repetitive, but this is a great course!"
98527,"I would say a strength is that the professors do have knowledge that is worth sharing in the field of climate change. That being said, the weakness of this course is that it is not engaging. If you do decide to take this course, do some research to find the best TF for you. Your success will be dependent on your ability to go to office hours, and work very hard for the first four weeks (when the problems sets end)."
98527,A little more background info
98527,"This course was not super engaging, so it was sometimes difficult to pay attention. This could probably be amended by engaging more with students in the course."
98527,Strengths: The assignments were very doable and pretty engaging. Weaknesses: Lectures were pretty advanced and material was quite technical for beginners. The course would benefit from drilling down more on basics.
98527,strengths: homeworks were well structured weakness: lectures were a bit dry at times
98527,strengths: interesting material weaknesses: I engaging lectures
98527,"Strengths: learned a lot about how the climate works, guest lectures were super cool Weakness: wish there was a little more structure"
98527,I like the dual-lecturer format and the way the class was incredibly comprehensive with regard to environmental topics.
98527,Strength: good way to do a survey of different topics  Weakness: not very engaging
98527,TAs were helpful assignments were manageable  lectures were sometimes too much material and very hard to follow and keep up
98527,"This may just be because of me, but I found it hard to pay attention in 70 minute lectures. Each class period went on for really long, and by the end I could not stay focused, which definitely impacted my learning. For me, 50 minute lectures would be perfect. However, I still think that this class was thorough and for anyone genuinely interested in how climate change works, it would be helpful."
98527,strengths: diversity of the lectures and how the assignments are chronologically structured weaknesses: lack of engagement of the professors with the students
98527,"The recorded lecture format makes it easy to disengage from the course, but I think it offers nice flexibility and the assignments (midterm, climate modeling) push students to reengage. Perhaps more assignments like that in future? Also I enjoyed having guest speakers and appreciated the way that no assignment was more than 25% of the grade."
98530,"Strengths: I LOVE THE FILMS, I do not consider myself a big movie/film buff, neither do I think of myself as a romcom person at all... After watching Roman Holiday and some of the other films in this course, I fell in love with older Hollywood narratives. This course is simply amazing, and every lecture from Prof. Thomasson feels like a story.  Weaknesses: NONE"
98530,"Only strengths, no weaknesses. Every movie was great, there was never a dull lecture, and we even played Jeopardy twice. One of the few classes in my time at Yale that I genuinely looked forward to going to each day."
98530,"Honestly, I wouldn't change anything about the course. It is fun, engaging, really interesting, and a great time. Camille and the teaching staff care so much about their students and it has a great classroom energy. Not super challenging nor a lot of work."
98530,"Strengths: Professor Thomasson is such a wonderful, kind soul who really makes this course shine. All the TFs are wonderful as well! Every lecture felt like listening to a story or a super engaging podcast. This is a must-take for any student!"
98530,"Strengths: Professor Thomasson is an angel and it's a joy to learn from her. The second you step into the Alice Cinema for each class, you are greeted with her ear-to-ear smile and the film score for that week's film. It's like stepping into a magical Disneyland ride for 50 minutes twice a week, and her lectures are gripping, suspenseful in the fascination they build for the topic, and leave the class clapping at the end of every lecture. Professor Thomasson creates such a joy for learning through her infectious enthusiasm for the course and creation of a community of eager students and TFs. She learns your name and genuinely cares about your successshe hosts the most wonderful office hours with tea/espresso, cake, and the fun treasures she's collected from a fun life of filmmaking. She reads each students' papers and sends each student thoughtful email responses to essays and extra credit discussion posts. The weekly readings are also quite light, which enables students to complete them thoughtfully and bring ideas to section for engaging conversations. Professor Thomasson also has fun Team Jeopardy tournaments between sections and has check-ins where we rate our favorite filmsboth those screened on Tuesday nights and those optional to watch for extra credit over the weekend (highly recommend!).   Weaknesses: Absolutely none!"
98530,"This course is awesome! Lectures are incredibly engaging, and sections are a casual, fun opportunity to discuss the week's film. The only improvement could be more regular feedback on our writing, but I still feel like I improved as a writer, regardless."
98530,"Strengths: I can't imagine a professor more invested in her students than Camille is. Above and beyond everything else, she wants you to be enjoying yourself, and she succeeds at that. She has so many fun days -- Jeopardy x2, HUAC reenactment, the day she brought in musical instruments -- that don't feel superfluous but make me never know what's going to happen next in a way that never makes me want to miss class. This class also has one of the best sections I've ever been in. Camille really wants a community of people and something about section made that happen. It was the section that felt the least like pulling teeth of any section I've ever been in.  Weaknesses: I wish the course was slightly more information-dense. Two 50-minute lectures isn't a ton of time, and often her lectures would be 40-45 minutes. Some of those lectures also consisted mostly of anecdotes about the week's movie -- I wish more of the time could have been spent to talk more generally about the time period. I don't really feel like my understanding of Classical Hollywood changed that much after taking this class."
98530,"No weaknesses, besides better communication on where to find extra credit on canvas."
98530,"Strength: CAMILLE THOMASSON. She is such a gem and probably one of my favorite profs ever. So kind and caring, and such a wonderful teacher. The TFs were also amazing, and always willing to help. Weaknesses: none."
98530,The lectures were phenomenal and very engaging
98530,Only strengths!! I genuinely looked forward to every single lecture and Professor Thomasson is amazing. Each lecture felt like a ted talk in the best possible way. The films were enjoyable and varied. Section was usually interesting. Overall great course!
98530,Professor Thomasson is the greatest strength of this course. Her passion for the subject is apparent in every lecture. Every single class is engaging and interactive and she conducts it in a way that it is hard to be anything other than fully invested. Can't think of anything that can be improved!
98530,"Incredible class, no weaknesses"
98530,Very engaging and the film selection is absolutely amazing. Truly delightful.
98530,"Strengths: Lectures are fantastic, sections are fun and compelling, readings are not too bad, assignments are fun and flexible to your interests, the anthology of movies is wonderful, Camille Thomasson is the sweetest person alive Weaknesses: It's only one semester."
98530,"Prof Thomasson (and the teaching staff) is definitely the biggest strength of the course; she is one of the most passionate, helpful professors I've met at Yale. I'd have very few suggestions for improvement: the workload is adequate (currently 15 pages of film journals, one interview project, two papers, readings before every class, weekly film screenings) and the class is highly informative and enjoyable."
98530,I love the films and the lectures. some of the best lectures I've even had at Yale.  Grading on papers felt a bit harsh sometimes.
98530,This course was highly organized and it was clear what we needed to do for the following week.
98530,"This course's strength is Prof. Thomasson and the amazing TFs. Prof. Thomasson is the most warm, invested professor I've had at Yale, and made each class and office hours visit a joy. The class is extremely well structured for student learning, and the objectives for students are clear from the beginning. The organization of the syllabus and the chronological/thematic progression of the films is done with care and intention. There are no real weaknesses to this class -- only that so many Yale students won't be able to take it in their time here."
98530,"The lectures were excellent very instructive in terms of both content and modeling analysis.  The course could be improved with more attention to technical terminology and knowledge of film, either during section or lecture. I felt that one section worth of going over vocab and tools for analysis wasn't enough, and I had to do a lot of learning on my own in order to write at the class's expected level. Spending certain days focusing just on cinematography, sound, editing or mise-en-scne would have been very helpful."
98530,Very well structured and engaging lectures. The assignments and schedules were very clear through the Canvas modules. The syllabus was organized well and the week-to-week focus was clear.
98530,"strengths: Prof Camille's lecturing style! Absolutely draws you in and I left every lecture wanting more. The teaching fellows are so helpful and engaging, especially when you've never taken a film class before. Manageable workload, tons of extra credit opportunities, intimate class community weaknesses: honestly none"
98530,This class is taught perfectly!
98549,This course is amazing in terms of format. 2 lectures are built around a film screening. Pre-screening lecture on director's filmography and the movie's context. Post-screening lecture on film analysis.
98549,The professor is the strength of this course. She has an extensive knowledge on Italian history and films. One to one pre-writing session with my TA was also very helpful. Weakness : I don't think a final exam is necessary to this class.
98549,"It's an interesting class, but you have to be engaged in order to get something out of it. The turnaround time for essays was very short, and grading was very dependent on your TF."
98549,"I genuinely loved some of the films we watched, but I also found it very difficult to get through some of them. I don't imagine the film list will ever be changed but I wish there was a chance for me to focus on the films that resonated with me in my essays. As of now you have to equally write about every film. I also think having a final exam is a bit excessive on top of the four essays. We were told the best way to prepare for the exam is to study our notes, but I think it's tricky to take good notes in class since it is largely based on class discussion. But the professor is very kind and certainly willing to help during office hours, and she also takes the effort to learn everyone's name which is appreciated."
98549,Good class for non-humanities people to learn about film.
98549,"The films are great, and Prof. Millicent is a good lecturer."
98549,"I think the course shows some amazing movies, but some of the more modern movies I didnt love. I also think that the Tuesday lectures are not super informative"
98549,"I wouldve loved for this class to be smaller. My favorite part of the class was talking to my TF and other students about the films, but in class there was never space for between-student discussion. I do see why it was necessary to have more of a call and response format for class participation, though, given the size."
98549,"Beautiful lectures that cover film from a variety of angles, extremely helpful prewriting sessions."
98549,"I think the essays could be a little more evenly spaced out, but they were not too long and so it was manageable to write those five pages in five days (and extensions were given when necessary), though a bit more leeway wouldve been nice."
98549,"Boring lectures. I love Penny, but she drones on and on about pointless stuff. Lame lectures a lot of the time."
98549,"strength: the course content is genuinely quite interesting and Professor Marcus is very dedicated to teaching and knowledgeable about the field  weakness: the turnaround time for essays is quite short, which can make writing feel rushed sometimes.I wished there were drafting periods"
98549,Strengths: Great films and professor Weakness: None
98549,Great movies
98549,"Incredible lectures by Professor Marcus, fantastic TAs and one-on-one time with TAs. My only critique was I thought the quality of movies in the last unit was lesser than the rest of the course."
98549,"strengths: Professor Marcus, most of the films were enjoyable, the pre-writing sessions with the TAs, you can choose from multiple prompts for each paper  weaknesses: 4 papers and a final exam feels unnecessary, grading really depends on your TA"
98549,"Strengths: the films, Professor Marcus. Weaknesses: the Tuesday lectures, the workload. I feel as though the course could be improved by shortening the lectures, or eliminating the Tuesday lecture, which I felt (with some exceptions) did not help in analyzing the films or developing an understanding of Italian film."
98549,"I wish this course could be a seminar! The lecture format sometimes made it difficult to get to the nitty-gritty. I also wish that there were some more diverse directors.   I absolutely loved the readings because they weren't always directly about the films. Instead, they helped inform my opinion of the readings by offering me philosophical, theoretical tools through which to view them."
98549,"well organized, great lectures, very engaging"
98549,"only two or three of the films are enjoyable to watch and study (coming from someone who loves film classes/film studies) the lectures are hit or miss interesting and boring, and the papers are super rigid and draining to get through"
98549,"Strengths: Prof Marcus knows literally everything about the topic. It's a joy to hear her lecture as she is incredibly knowledgeable about the content. The movies are an excellent, representative set of films that are united trio-wise by a common thread, which makes the class entertaining and organized.  Weaknesses: the paper turnaround can be pretty brutal. You practically have four days to produce a 1500 word paper (and the papers are not easy). and then have basically two and a half free weeks from classwork. I thought the pre-writing sessions were pretty helpful but having to produce either a completed paragraph or a detailed outline less than a day after watching the last movie adds to the workload asymmetry. I would recommend that Prof Marcus make the papers due by the following Wednesday film screening rather than the Tuesday lecture, and provide an option to have pre-writing sessions on Saturday."
98549,"strengths: most of the films were great and a good watch weaknesses: having both a final paper and a 3 hour long final exam with 2-3 essay questions (especially when we didnt have any information on what the final would consist of until a little over a week before, and the vocab that we were going to be tested on was things that couldve been from anything throughout the semester)."
98592,"The course tries its best to present itself as relevant to global affairs majors. While for my particular profession it is not, which made it difficult to remain engaged with the material, I understand that this is not the case for everybody and hence am not writing it off immediately. The course (and by that I principally mean the professor) does its absolute best to set students up for the real world with the assumption that they will confront similar instances of statistical output in the future. In short, it should not be a required class, but for those willing to take it, it is amazing."
98592,It is very well taught!
98592,The class is organized very well and material is very accessible. More office hours from TAs would be appreciated
98592,"Strengths: Very well organized, the professor and TFs coordinate each week, and the problem sets and exams are predictable - no surprises there.  Weaknesses: We use Stata, not R; R is much more popular nowadays and more powerful than Stata.  Tip: If you are enrolled in any Econ class, reach out to the DUS of Econ and you can get Stata for free. The TFs can help with this."
98592,"Biggest weakness is JT is very disorganized. He is very helpful in office hours, but lecture is consistently treated like office hours (everyone asks a ton of questions) and we then don't cover most of the material and most of the class zones out. It is a good class, but we move really slow."
98592,"strengths - great professor and TAs. Highly qualified to be teaching and leading students. weaknesses - not enough office hours, very slow pacing in class"
98592,JT is the big strength. The material is also quite interesting. No weaknesses in my mind.
98592,"I really appreciate how flexible JT was with the due dates of problem sets if we were behind in class or if you communicated that you would have a lot of work. I always felt like the class was fair, which I think is really important for a student."
98592,JT really wants everyone to understand all of the content. This means that I left the course with a strong understanding of all the topics we covered. It also meant that we moved pretty slowly; one P-set was cancelled and we didnt even finish the last lecture. I think we could have sped up the pace of the class a little.
98592,I think the course could be a bit faster paced and more difficult. I also think we could be expected to learn more Stata syntax since this is probably what we will be using in our work.
98592,"strengths: Super engaging class, fun atmosphere, great TA's Weaknesses: Possible include more detailed slides/expectations of the exams, very hard homework"
98592,"Strengths: the tools we learn are actually useful, and you leave the class with a strong understanding of when each tool should be used and what it can tell you. Weaknesses: the TFs take painfully long to grade assignments, so it's difficult to get feedback, and there are limited preparation resources for the exams. Slides are also very unhelpful to review afterwards - there are lots of questions without answers on the slides, which is frustrating given how much the class emphasizes precision in wording."
98592,Strengths: JT is a very personable professor and wants you to do well. He explains concepts well and goes at an understandable pace  Weaknesses: sometimes just became a semantics class where you had to get the wording exactly right to get full points
98592,Strengths: - very well structured and organised
98592,"The course covers a lot of material over a short period of time. However, with this said, I think the class time at one hour and 15 minutes was a bit long for a math lecture. Additionally, while the professor is hard to get a hold of, the TAs are very prompt in responding and helpful with questions students have. The psets are also very long, but I liked how we had a week to do them."
98592,JT is a great instructor. He teaches you exactly what he wants to evaluate you on and will not move on until he feels confident that the class understands. I feel like the class prepared me well for all of the examinations. I think the course could benefit by having student teaching fellows.
98592,Justin Thomas' teaching is excellent.
98592,"Strengths: engaging, fast-paced, JT is a fantastic instructor, the TFs are great. Weaknesses: cold calling is terrifying (engaging, but scary), material can be boring"
98592,This course is well-organized and structured for student learning. For each lecture there were segments saved for questions which made for a great learning environment. Participation was encouraged. Discussion sections helped with practicing and understanding the material taught during lecture.
98592,"The main piece of feedback I have is PowerPoint slide improvement. The most difficult concept of the entire semester (triple interactions) had truly terrible slides. Section slides did help fill in the gaps, but it would've been nice if this was improved."
98592,"There could be more practice problems offered, and clear revision of the distinctions between the most important methods could be explained a bit better. However, overall the course was taught really well, and Prof. Thomas ensured that students were caught up with the material to the best of any professors ability."
98592,JT is a great instructor. The course was super slow though.
98592,"Strengths: JT's personality- made me smile and laugh which is a rare thing, especially in a stats class; JT's deep care for us as students was self-evident and admirable; detailed and helpful feedback from TF's on exams and psets. Weaknesses: lectures were confusingly organized and we spent too much time on concepts that required little explanation; too much information was only said verbally and in a bit of a roundabout way; relatedly, the slides didn't have key information on them (sometimes only conceptual questions, without the conceptual answer, which was frustrating); STATA output from class (with much-needed syntax information) was not provided to students; took a while to get psets back; exams were quite difficult and required very specific wording (not outlined in lecture but sometimes in section) to receive full credit; too much time spent on student questions during lecture which did not contribute to the understanding of the class as a whole"
98592,"Understanding the material can be exciting and engaging. However I found JTs lectures to be unnecessary complicated and useless, and I instead rather relied on sections."
98592,The course offers a lot of useful skills and the lectures are incredibly engaging. The class did feel like it got bogged down at points and perhaps could have touched an additional topic or two covering a completely different are of statistics.
98592,"strength - JT is a great guy, funny, and a good teacher weakness- material itself is at times boring"
98592,"This course is very engaging and the problem sets really help for the exams, so there are no surprises."
98592,"Strengths of this course was the organization and the discussion sections. Jane, my TA was amazing at synthesizing and confirming any doubts of the material of the week."
98592,Often very disorganized but overall interesting and well taught.
98592,"This course moves at a pretty slow pace which is helpful for getting a full grasp of each concept, yet sometimes I wish less time would be spent answering individual questions in class and more office hours or section time available."
98592,"Strengths: Engaging professor and TFs, PSETs correlate well with exams Weaknesses: Heavy workload, some structural disorganization"
98592,"Strengths: The professor!!! The lectures are extremely engaging and JT makes an effort to get everyone interested in the topic, even in a large lecture course. The discussion sections help to reinforce the materials and there are many office hours available. However, I found that the discussion section quality varied greatly based on the slides- it may help to create a unified set of slides that reinforce the key concepts. The feedback on the psets is very helpful, though I wish that we had received the feedback more in advance of exams.  Weaknesses: The problem sets are quite lengthy, and sometimes redundant towards the end- I think that they could be paired down and then there could be optional questions to reinforce learning. These optional questions could help us review for exams."
98592,This course was pretty boring and hard to fully engage with. There was a lot of in class or in section practice with coding and interpreting regressions which was helpful. Problem sets were hard and would have appreciated more time going over them or taking about concepts.
98592,"Strengths: interactive lecture, problem sets really help towards the exams, lots of office hours and really helpful TAs, lecture goes through challenging topics more slowly   Weaknesses: JT can go over the same new topic in many different ways during lecture which can be helpful for some but if you understand it the first time it can be repetitive or can cause confusion"
98592,"JT is a great instructor who has clear teaching although he can go a little slow. I appreciate that he takes the time to really answer each person's questions. I think if you start the Psets on time and go into AQA 2 with a buddy who understood AQA 1's format, even if you didn't take AQA 1 (like me) you can still do okay in the course."
98592,"Strength: potential applications to real life data analysis and research. Weaknesses: slides were not helpful, material moves very slowly, problem sets graded very slowly."
98592,"one thing I think is great is the before class stories, but still I believe not opening up the lecture for online viewing can impact me or other students like me, if I cannot absorb everything in one go, it is impossible to check again until a few days before class."
98592,"Strengths: JT is absolutely great, teaches interpretations of statistical outputs in a very easy and digestible way, psets are not hard and exams are a lot like the psets  Weaknesses: maybe could work to make students more proficient in stata so that they can do commands without having to search up basic things"
98592,Slides are very difficult to review from- i do wish key information or answers to rhetorical questions were provided in the slides.
98592,"I loved this class! JT always engaged the class during lectures and had large Q&A portions as we worked through problems together, which made the material much more approachable. The discussion sections were also very helpful in solidifying my understanding of the subject."
98592,"Strengths: This class prepares you to read research papers and conduct your own research. You learn when different types of tests are appropriate, allowing you to evaluate the researchers methodology, and you learn how to interpret the output from the researchers statistical analysis.  Weaknesses: Sometimes the underlying math of each analytical tool is brushed away. I felt like I knew how to use the different tools, and I knew how to interpret what they produced, but I didnt know what they were actually doing."
98592,This course covers a wide range of topics but focuses in on them in depth. It is extremely well-taught and engaging and JT distills the complex things we learn into easily-digestible material. I personally can't identify any weaknesses in this course.
98592,"Professor Thomas is very clear at explaining, he has a proven method to consolidate knowledge through lecture, section, problem sets, and office hours.  I really like that he emphasizes the use of plain English as it allows us to demonstrate how much we understand. However, I am sometimes lost in class with the amount of interventions from students. From certain participations I sometimes miss to understand what parts from my peers' responses are correct and which ones are not. Therefore, although I appreciate participation, I wish that summaries/ wrap ups were made more often to make sure that the whole class is on the same page."
98592,"Strengths - clear explanation of concepts, lots of help through TAs Weaknesses - NA"
98592,"JT is really thorough in his teaching of the course and provides lots of opportunities for students to clarify concepts being taught in the class. The class is a great one for students looking to gain a firm grasp of stats fundamentals. You won't find a more engaging teacher than JT. That being said, because he tries to ensure that all questions get answered in class, we weren't able to finish some of the topics on the syllabus and it's a pity that there isn't another JT-taught follow-up class to go through what was left out."
98599,"Strengths: The professor and the TF were great people and they really made the class environment enjoyable. Additionally throughout most of the semester the format of the course made the class less stressful. Weaknesses: Personally, I thought that at some points the class was really unstructured and I wished that, especially during problem sets, the final project, and even the reading responses, we had clearer expectations about what we should do. As a result, I felt there was a huge leap between the course material and the level of difficulty for assignments, which made some parts of the course more challenging than others. The TF (Amanda), however, was great at addressing many of those concerns."
98599,"This course was moved online for the Spring semester, which was unfortunate. I wish the course were more consistent with the syllabus, but the actual subject matter his interesting."
98599,"This course was entirely on Zoom, which is not ideal but understandable given the circumstances. To compensate, there should have been more structure and organization with the course as a whole to ensure continued student engagement."
98599,"The course was designed very well. The topics were interesting and well planned, the assignments and projects were helpful and matched the coherence of the course. However, the execution was not ideal. Because the class took place over Zoom, it was really hard to get the most out of it."
98599,Class went off syllabus plan in the middle
98599,"Strength - very relaxed course, professor P was very nice as was the TA, Amanda Weiss. Not too much course work either Weakness - It was completely online, which can be a strength or weakness depending on the person"
98599,The strength of the course is definitely Professor Aronow and TF Amanda. Working with them and learning from them as well as the engage classmates are definitely highlights of my last semester at Yale. The only weakness is that I sometimes feel that the 50-min class session is rather rushed towards the end. Wish we had more time!
98603,"Strengths: the online nature of some of the guest lectures, the selection of guest lectures, the TAs. The guest lecturer on social entrepreneurship was interesting.  Weaknesses: the midterm was time pressured, and sometimes the lectures were too general and I didnt feel like I learned any new perspectives. This could be improved by talking more about the solutions brainstormed for global health issues."
98603,The TFs were awesome and having the weekly sections was great to discuss the material.
98603,"great class, nice for stem majors"
98603,"Strengths: low workload, interesting discussions in section and mellow vibe overall. Weaknesses: this course doesn't really teach you very much."
98603,The course was packed densely with a lot of information which was fantastic. This was both a strength and weakness as I felt lecture went really fast. I wish we had two 1 hr 15 min sessions a week as opposed to two 50 min sessions so I could have longer osmosis of global health! The class was just so interesting; I truly wish it was longer.
98603,"Strengths: The guest lecturers were quite exciting, and I enjoyed hearing from them about their work. Dr. Fallon is also a very kind professor, and her lectures are enjoyable to listen to. I also enjoyed the weekly readings.  Weaknesses: I think the biggest weakness of this course is the content. Many students stopped showing up to lecture (and Dr. Fallon even noted this), and I think one of the reasons why is because the lectures are not built around stimulating new conversations. Instead, they felt very surface level, and I found that when I sat down to study for my final, I had learned a bunch of facts about global health, but had not really developed any new conceptual insights about the field. It was also a little boring to sit through these lectures given Dr. Fallon's expertise and wealth of insights. I wish the discussion sections did a better job of elevating the conversations stemming from lecture, or if the course was restructured into a seminar to allow for a better grappling of the course themes."
98603,"Sterngth of the course was the guest lectures. These were really enjoyable and nice to hear from a variety of people who were outside of Yale which helped demonstrate real-world context of the topics we were learning. I also appreciated the extra credit opportunites for the midterm and final, the grading was kind and the papers were not too long."
98603,Strengths: very interesting topics throughout the whole class
98603,"Strengths: covers a lot of relevant topics in a clear manner  Weaknesses: this is a ""scratch the surface"" type course that covers a lot but not super in depth. Personally, I really liked this because it was my first global health class but others who are already knowledgeable may not like it. The exams are very fast paced (although they are open note), I personally would rather a closed-note exam with more time, I'm not a fast test taker and I don't think its fair or conducive to student learning"
98603,"Strengths - Good survey course that introduces you to a lot of themes in global health. Cara Fallon is a great lecturer and the TA team seemed good. Weaknesses - Sometimes the grading was unclear and very TA dependent. Also due to the nature of the survey course, you couldn't go in-depth into topics which was a little hard."
98603,Not many weaknesses - I think that this course was fantastic!
98603,The midterm exam did not provide enough time to adequately answer all the questions but the final was a better set up. There were a lot of guest lecturers towards the end that added valuable info.
98603,"Lots of statistics and memorization, but a strong focus on ethics and people in global health, which I appreciated."
98603,Great lectures but test were graded by TAs that were not yours and they were subject to their ways of teaching in evaluation
98603,"Strengths: offering different perspectives from the field and introducing key challenges that students could think critically about and reflect on in the form of papers, projects, and exams  Weaknesses: none in particular, only perhaps that there was typically more exam material than the allotted time allowed for, so completing everything was a bit of a time constraint."
98603,This course was the perfect amount of engagement. The lectures were interesting as there were many guest lecturers that kept the content tailored for the real world. However there were times when the content could get a little repetitive such as the two writing assignments which felt they were very similar in content.
98603,"strengths: good introductory survery course, exams and writing assignments are fair assessments and applications of knowledge, discussion sections were very interesting  weaknesses: given the nature of the field, it felt like we learned a lot about challenges but the responses were less clear (this connects to the complexity theme), very introductory so we don't go very in-depth on any given topic"
98603,Strengths are the lecturer and section was fun. Weaknesses are timing for exams
98603,"The guest lecturers were great and the slides for the lectures overall were very comprehensive. I appreciated that the final was a take-home, but I wish the lectures were recorded."
98603,"This course is very surface-level information and does not provide much content. Although organized, there were many lectures and very few discussion sections where we could really talk about the material. This class could be improved by decreasing the number of lectures. I do not know what I learned despite all these lectures."
98603,Strengths are the guest lecturers which were very interesting. Weakness was the time crunch on the exams.
98603,Strengths - Professor was incredible!
98603,"Overall I feel that one strength of this course was the discussion sections. I also felt that the lectures were pretty good, but the discussion sections were where we really got to think critically about global heatlh issues. I would say that one strength of this course was the teaching team; Dr. Fallon was a good lecturer and all of the TFs seemed pretty excited about global health issues as well. I think that this course could be improved by adjusting the assignments to have more variety. Our two big assignments besides the midterm and finals were both writing assignments, and the prompts honestly seemed quite similar to each other. I also thought the timing was a bit unfortunate and not-thought-through, as we had a paper due very shortly after the midterm."
98603,"Strengths: interesting course content, engaging lecturer Weaknesses: As a survey class, it's incredibly surface level. Lectures didn't require a lot of engagement, because most of it was common sense (e.g. poverty makes healthcare harder). Ethical issues introduced in class were not really explored in depth, and sections didn't enhance my understanding of any material."
98610,Lectures are engaging and informative
98610,It repeats certain topics from other classes.
98610,"Strengths: Professor Hasanbasri is very organized and open to feedback, the organization helped me learn, the content at times was interesting, the TAs were GREAT  Weaknesses: We should not have had a final project and final exam (one or the other), we should have had a basic econ review at the start of this class (everyone is at different levels), Professor Hasanbasri fit too much into one lecture (it should have been spaced out more- though I am sure she did this as required by the Global department), WAY too econ/data heavy (STATA should not play a huge role in the class)-- i wish we got to study more case studies on international development rather than focus on merging data/coding, we did not have any psets for the second half of the semester which was a problem because aside from practice problems before the final exam we had no practice with the information we learned in lecture, homework/attendance should be weighted heavier, data lab was useless/we should not have had it (unless you want to learn to code more with STATA), ED discussion responses not really helpful (you don't usually get a straight answer)"
98610,"The course, again, features a very shallow overview of topics in development. Most topics are covered to a lesser extent than in the introductory economics sequence (particularly, Introductory Macroeconomics). All topics are covered to a much lesser extent than in Intermediate Macroeconomics. All Global Affairs majors have taken at least Introductory Macroeconomics and many were taking Intermediate Macroeconomics, ultimately making the class feel unfulfilling and disengaging. The organization of the topics, further, did not feel sequential or logical, but I imagine this follows in any course attempting to cover too wide a breadth at too shallow a depth.  What I was looking for in this course was an intense coverage of the theory and literature in development. Certainly, the current literature was covered in class, but it felt as though the professor saw the pedagogical value as being merely methodological and not theoretical. This is the inverse of what should be: GLBL 225 fails to (and should fail to) reach the depths of methodology reached in Applied Quantitative Analysis I & II and that Global Affairs should further reach in their major-required methods course. Without having reached depths in development theory, how can methodology be expected to set in? If the course will not have weight in our methodological training, it should at least help connect what we have learned to advanced levels in our introductory and intermediate economics courses with an intense coverage of development theory. In not focusing on one of these, GLBL 225 ultimately left me without a substantive, cohesive collective of new knowledge and without a development upon prior knowledge which I might have associated solely with that course (an objective I think any course at Yale should have).  The course's ethic regarding student time, section, and workloads is also interesting. I do not mind a heavy-workload course such as AQA II, but GLBL 225 features: weekly or semi-weekly problem sets, required sections called ""Data Labs"" with associated required ""Data Labs"" that are de facto additional problem sets, a ""Data Project"" spanning the whole semester, a midterm, and final exam. I see the pedagogical value in sections as being a place to review and ask questions about lecture not a place to teach completely new and separate material and this is consistent with how well-established Yale courses treat sections (viz. GLBL 121-2, ECON 115-6, ECON 121-2). That should take place in a separate course."
98610,"Weaknesses: I did not like that there was a final project AND a final exam back to back and both worth relatively high amounts of our grade. The final exam felt unnecessary, and the lack of problem sets after the midterm meant that we never practiced any of the material that was covered on the final. Additionally, topics that were barely covered in lecture were eligible to be tested on the final exam. Data labs were not helpful, as they usually tried to cover way too much material for the time allotted. At least two groups of students would always stay behind after discussion section because there had not been enough time to finish the data lab assignment for that day, and the TA could only help so many groups in the amount of class time.  Strengths: I think that some of the topics are very interesting and I liked the short documentaries that we watched both for homework and in class."
98610,The professor needs to be changed. I have never had such a low engagement with a course during my time at Yale.
98610,"Strengths - well-rounded approach to development, solid theory, good design/curriculum. Weaknesses - pacing (almost no work for the first half of the semester and then a massive project during the second half), ineffective section/data lab"
98610,Weaknesses: I dont feel like I know the basics of development. I feel like we only focused on niche case studies that didnt rly have anything to do with the course.
98610,Weaknesses: Too much stats and econometrics
98610,"Strengths: It wasn't particularly hard, Ardina and the TAs were incredibly nice and I think really tried to make the experience as ascertainable as possible Weaknesses: This class definitely needs to be reworked slightly. The general flow doesn't make a ton of sense. It's essentially macro with a couple of case studies and a lot of Stata. I wish we had talked more about the theories behind development, what's worked, and what hasn't than focusing on big thematic macro concepts"
98610,"The class was all structured around case studies that were only tangentially relevant to what we were learning. At times it fluctuated between incredibly simple (re-doing the Ricardian model or Solow) or way too complex for skills that we don't need. The sections were not helpful with course material and always went 30 minutes over, which is a testament to the poor structure of the class. There was also no reason to have both a final exam and a final project, and just contributed to the busy-work feeling of the entire semester."
98610,"Strengths: The case studies were all very interesting. It was extremely helpful to go over the key findings and experimental design in class.   Weaknesses: I did not feel like I learned that much from the section (they felt a bit too long). The lectures sometimes jumped topics and it would have been easier to conceptualize if they were organized more clearly. Most importantly, I think we should have spent more time on econometrics topics. Things like the Dr. Strange lecture were difficult to understand and deserved more time than the lecture where we debated international trade."
98610,"I think the course did a great job of covering a lot of concepts at a very accessible level. I think that the ""data lab"" was really unnecessary -- especially for students with a ton of coding experience, it's really unreasonable to have to sit and listen to someone teach you to do something that you could've done in 2 minutes otherwise. From my experience, even the students who didn't have experience weren't paying attention because the data labs were just the TA talking for 40 minutes and then giving the exact answers, which everyone copied down and submitted in the last 5 mins."
98610,"Too much stata/coding in this class. The AQA sequence, I thought, was meant to prepare us for the stata we would need to use in the major, but the stata we learned in this course was NOT taught during AQA."
98610,The slides and lectures were concerningly badly made
98610,The course's strength lay primarily in Professor Hasanbasri. She was an incredible resource for clear and concise explanations of the material covered by the class and went to great lengths to ensure students' needs were met.
98610,"The strength is that it provides interesting application of general economic concepts to the specific situation of development. The main weakness is that this course is trying to be many things at once. It is at once an econ course, a stats course, and a coding course. It is hard to study for exams, because you don't know which part of the course you should study for."
98610,"Data lab sections very informative with Stata commands. Not so much practice with class material in problem sets, though."
98610,The course was really poorly organized and lectures were really hard to follow
98610,I think a final project and final exam is a little much. I honestly think it would be better to have like weekly mini psets that are a little more challenging than a final project. The psets could include a problem then ask us to code and analysis a smaller portion or something.
98610,"This course is incredibly redundant. Nearly single concept has been explored in AQA and Intro Macro to some capacity, yet this class is hard because the grading is nitpicky and directions and questions are often not clear. The prof is knowledgeable but it was difficult to engage because lectures were dry."
98610,"The main weakness of this class is that is structured as such a hodge-podge of topics. Theres really no sense of curriculum, and honestly I found the course to be so heavily focused on research design and methodology rather than actual development policy (this is a larger problem with the Jackson core). Also, because there was so much emphasis on Stata (data lab was always so confusing and I was consistently leaving 20 minutes after my section time ended which was not okay) we ended up not having any time to engage with the actual lecture content (which is what the exams were both based on 60% of our grade). Instead, our discussion section was data lab and our problem sets were basically all just check points for our data project."
98610,"With all due respect to Professor Hasanbasri, who is a very kind and approachable professor and person for whom I have a lot of respect, this was one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale. Instead of teaching us international development, this course skims some economics in a confusing and roundabout way, focuses lectures on specific papers rather than big picture ideas, dwells on hyper-specific models and coding skills, devotes sections not to critical discussion but to esoteric Stata lessons, and only in rare cases covers actual international development. We didn't discuss the history of the debt crisis, the Washington Consensus, the IMF, the pros and cons of World Bank actions, theories of dependence--none of that. This is a quantitative econ course--and a confusing one at that. I would not recommend the Global Affairs major without warning somebody about it. One plus was that they spread out the data project--I appreciated not having to cram all of it."
98610,"I thought that the course was nice but as someone super interested in global development and health, I felt the course didn't really leave me feeling like I learned something. The structure of the class was more STATA-oriented which was good in the sense of having a tangible skill to implement, but I wish we discussed policies and current events more - it didn't really feel like a GLOBAL class. I thought a strength was the TAs, they were super kind and helpful, but I just didn't feel like I learned what I expected to, and I thought especially after spring break we didn't really have a direction for the course to go in we simply just looked at recent regression analysis in the field and random results in development economics, without really understanding the thread tying it together. I kind of understood the point of the order of the papers after going over them with the professor, but otherwise, having both a final project and final exam was a lot for one course. I felt I couldn't really devote the necessary time for the final project and on something I was really interested in."
98610,"Weaknesses: Lectures not engaging; slides not engaging and do not provide adequate information; distribution of work poorly planned; PSETs do not help in learning the material; The final project took way too long to complete and since it was due days before the final exam, there was not sufficient time to complete the project and properly prepare for the exam; The exams are very specific and many of it tests knowledge of econ skills and not development; Did not feel like an international development course as much of the emphasis was on econ theories"
98610,Lecture attendance could get messy sometimes (wi-fi was not working sometimes) and by the end of semester there were no more checks
98610,"I think this course did a good job giving us practical tools to pursue development work from an econ perspective. The first semester was very cohesive, and the psets helped us get a handle on the material. A weakness for this course was the organization of the second half of the semester (post-midterm). Our psets were related to our final project, rather than the material, so the course content did not feel as cohesive, and, until I studied the practice exams for the final, I didn't have a good grip on applying the concepts. I also would have appreciated more development theory / seminal papers. As global majors, we all have to have an econ background through the core, so many of the econ concepts I had seen before. However, I do not know development concepts as well and would have benefited from getting a better theoretical background."
98610,"I think this course should be a pre-req for macro classes, because much of the material would have been very helpful prior to macro, but felt very repetitive after."
98610,"The course is very clear and the slides are effective. In the beginning half of the course, it was a little difficult to see exactly how everything tied together. It did in the end, but I think it could be emphasized more in the beginning."
98610,"Better structure, honestly just having people take other classes and skip this one"
98610,"I thought that the TAs couldve been a bit more hands-on in the data labs, but still, I gained a lot from them!"
98610,"The main strength of this course is how problem sets were designed to ensure incremental work on the final project. With regards to weaknesses, the course did not appropriately address major themes and theories related to ""approaches to international development"", but felt more like a crossover between a data course and introductory microeconomics which all students taking this course are required to take as per the Global Affairs requirements. The course was too focused on studies and quantitative data, and did not engage with topics like the Washington Consensus or Asian approaches to development through the BRI."
98610,"International development is a critical topic, and I was really disappointed that this class boiled it down to an assessment of research methods and stata syntax rather than an analysis of the issues themselves and how to solve them.   -There were typos in nearly every exam, assignment, and slide deck- significant typos that changed the meaning of the question- eg. lower instead of higher, ""did impact"" vs ""did not impact"", etc. -The first exam was a very poor assessment of course knowledge, given the extensive length (most students came nowhere near to finishing, so grades were just a metric of how fast you worked/how few questions you left blank) and odd content that did not reflect the materials. The final exam was much better- both in terms of timing and content. -Most of the class and ""data labs"" focused on stata syntax, which we all have learnt (or will learn) in AQA. Most of the economics was material we learnt in the required economics sequence. The research methods were interesting, but pointless without a broader discussion of the issues, and misplaced when we have a research methods requirement. Moreover, the vast majority of global students are not going into academia, so while being literate in research methods is important, it is not nearly as important as having a basic grasp on how we are going to pull nearly a billion people out of poverty over the next few years while simultaneously achieving a massive energy transition. -The data labs were awful- no-one in my section knew what was going on or engaged with the material even vaguely, because it felt completely irrelevent. We spent weeks learning how to merge data in one specific software tool (not even R, which most of the world uses) instead of discussing international development. I would have loved to be able to discuss the big ideas and learn from my classmates in a real discussion section.  Overall, this would be a fine course on its own, but it made no sense as a core global requirement. We covered no policy (beyond brainstorming surface-level ideas on our own), which is what most students in the major are going on to study. The quantitative approaches would have been interesting if they were not repeats from the economics, statistics, and methods requirements that everyone already has to take for global. Moreover, it is not made clear in our transcripts or the course descriptions that is was a quantitative class.  This class would be greatly improved if the focus was shifted to study policy and aid interventions. Please bring in history and current events and political theory and move the course away from the minutia of coding in stata!  With all that being said, I really appreciated how kind and supportive the professor was. The problem is with the course and with the global major, not with her."
98610,"Strengths: I really appreciated when we looked at Case Studies. I also thought the lessons on inequality and the Lorenz curve were successful and important.   Weaknesses: There are a lot of questions I had that I wish this course would have answered. I wish it took a more detailed look at practitioners in the development space. For the Potential Outcome Model, I would use a real world example instead of Dr. Strange. In some of my other classes, like Econometrics, all the data and examples we used were from the real world. I thought this helped us learn about the world and understand when and how certain tools are used by practitioners. In this class, students were able to get by without doing the readings. I think it would be helpful to add a book, but not a textbook, to the syllabus.  I think a lot of the weaknesses of this class stem from its disconnection to the other global classes. I dont entirely blame Ardina for this, as the course is new, but I think it would help to know what students have and have not studied before taking this class.   As Global Affairs majors, all students in International Development have taken intro micro and macro economics, an additional intermediate economics class, and one or two statistical analysis classes. For this reason a lot of what we discussed had already been covered in other classes, and I think could be cut or covered much quicker. All students have studied the Solow Growth Model, the Ricardian Trade Model, and the effects of immigration on wages. Students with an econometrics background have seen the Potential Outcome Model, Regression Discontinuity Design, and Instrumental Variables before.   This is how I would reorganize the course: Unit 1 - What is Development? 	Questions: What is Poverty? What is inequality? 	Models/Topics: Solow Growth Model, Lorenz Curve, Convergence.  Unit 2 - Who are the Development Players? Who is trying to reduce poverty and inequality? 	Questions: What do these organizations do? What are their mandates? How do they differ? In what ways are they effective? In what ways are they controversial? 	Topics: IMF, WB, USAID, NGOs, UN  Unit 3 - Measuring Success. What do Development Players do to address poverty and inequality? 	Questions: What are the advantages to using different statistical tools in different scenarios? Disadvantages? 	Topics: Surveys, Potential Outcome Model, RDD, IV  Unit 4 - Case Studies.  	Examine cases of different Development Players using different strategies. How are they performing? When are development efforts successful and when do they fail?"
98610,"This course covers a wide range of topics and provides numerous case studies for us to understand how the theories proposed have been tested in the past. It also taught me a lot of new Stata commands that have been really useful in other cases. One weakness of the course is that it was at times slightly unengaging or disorganized. Whereas some lectures were really interesting, others seemed to have less relatable content and were harder to follow. It did not help that it was also at 9 am. Sections also frequently ran over, so I wish they were better timed to ensure we could cover all the material we had to cover in the allotted time."
98610,"Strengths: Bomi was such a wonderful TA and always willing to meet and answer questions during section/office hours! We will miss you Bomi! At least the professor gives practice problems before the exam, although they were usually filled with mistakes and extremely confusing wording.  Weakness: The professor was extremely dry and unhelpful, and very unresponsive to feedback on the course. The labs (discussion sections) are completely pointless, meant to teach us coding in STATA but are extremely ineffective because there is 1) little relevance to the class material 2) no time to actually practice what the code means because we are trying to write all of the code down as fast as we can since she plans too much to be accomplished in a 50 min. section. Also, the sections usually ran 15+ minutes over because no one could complete the labs in time. The problem sets added no no value because they were graded on completion usually, which meant that people submitted whatever they had even if it was extremely wrong. The exams as I mentioned had such confusing and terrible wording that it is hard to understand what was being tested sometimes, and also included questions about STATA code/syntax which is ridiculous. On this note, the material was at times extremely repetitive, covering material from AQA sequence and ECON 122. The final group project was also subjectively graded on a curve, with only the top 3 groups receiving full marks, and the rest of the groups being sorted into tiers. There was no rubric, so there is no way to tell what/how you got graded down on. Overall, this course turned me off from learning more about development and left me feeling extremely disappointed."
98664,"Great overall course. Professor Semmel was a solid lecturer who skillfully weaved together evidence and examples from multiple areas of the world in all of his lectures, each of which focused on a different topic or theme with a global dimension. The weekly readings were usually good and interesting (the primary sources much more so than the secondary ones, as the latter occasionally appeared dry and slightly too long), the weekly discussion session was helpful in building upon the understanding developed during the lectures, and the major assignments (weekly reading responses, 3 papers, one quiz-and-ID midterm, and one ID-and-essay final exam) were very fair while not requiring too much time to complete or prepare for."
98664,strengths: professor stuart weaknesses: the TAs
98664,"Lectures were sometimes hard to sit through and attendance at lecture was always low. I did not attend over half of the lectures and every time I did go, only about 1/4th of the class was there. Prof. Semmel is a nice professor but often would go into tiny details that didn't seem important and often made his lectures hard to follow. You did not have to go to lecture at all to be prepared for section or to write the papers perhaps they helped for the midterm and final, but you still didn't really have to go. The strengths of the course were Prof. Semmel's enthusiasm in teaching it, his communication and availability for students, as well as the discussion sections which were a little better engagement-wise. Personally, my TF was also fantastic in leading section and providing help and feedback to students on papers."
98664,Maybe slightly more linearity
98664,"This class is marketed as something it's not. It's not engaging, and flat out not interesting. The class suffers from poorly prepared lectures that consist of lecture slides with little to no content on them. The professor just cycles through each one of them and reads off them, and rambles for a bit about each. Unfortunately, the professor seemed to know little about the history of many of the places discussed (which is fair considering how broad the scope is), but this makes for a fairly disappointing class as the professor can't add anything on past whatever the lecture slide says."
98664,"Strengths: None   Weaknesses: The entire course. Lectures were boring and almost unbearable at times. Prof was monotone, mumbled a lot, and rambled on about random stuff. Not to mention we had a mask mandate which made it even harder to understand him. We had an entire lecture (50 minutes) about timber. Yes, literally about wood. While I can see why others would call this a gut because it's fairly easy to do well, it is not worth the awful lectures (which are also not recorded, btw). There are other Hu credits out there. Also, the lecture slides are useless so you have to attend lecture or get good notes from someone else."
98664,"A strength of the course is Prof. Semmel and his commitment to creating a comprehensive course with the lofty goal of presenting a global history. His lectures are well prepared and given, and I was able to leave each one feeling like I understood the central message that he communicated. The workload is also very manageable, and the exams are simple and easy to prepare for. I do not see any weaknesses for this course."
98664,Strengths: Gives a balanced view into global history. Shows the complexity of history and does not offer monocausal explanations to gain popularity (as some history courses do). Exams were also very fair.  Improvements: I think two essays is more than enough when there are two exams for a course -- the third felt a little overkill. While I understand how hard it is to teach this course -- sometimes a little more organisation could be useful. I often knew at the end of the lecture what the overarching theme or claim was but could be a little more organized.
98664,The strength of the course is that what is expected is very clear. Paper prompts and exam prompts align with lectures and readings very well. Main weakness is lack of planning from professor regarding what is expected.
98664,Strengths: focuses on interesting topics; covers a breadth of topics. Weaknesses: lectures were unengaging and had no clear focus.
98664,"Strengths: Professor Semmel is a great guy but the class is just not organized well. I felt like I didn't learn much from lecture at all. I learned mostly from discussion sections.   Weaknesses: lectures were often very dry and hard to pay attention during. I understand that it was difficult to concentrate on one topic since it's a world history class, but I think it would have been helpful to go in more depth on certain topics. We also didn't cover Latin America much at all."
98664,"The scope of this class is a challenge. Its also a really good component of the class. I think the fact that we wore masks really made it harder to pay attention than I thought it would. I thought, as interesting as it was, it wasnt quite rigorous enough to really pique my interest and keep me really engaged."
98664,"Power point slides during lecture were not always super engaging, but the readings assigned were great. Short and sweet for the most part."
98664,I think the PowerPoint could have been a bit more structured and robust
98664,"Strengths- easy history course for a non-major, interesting overview of world history, Professor Semmel is a good lecturer and has good TAs Weaknesses- course doesn't really go in-depth to any of the topics covered, might be boring for a history major, but section would be the chance to go more in-depth"
98664,Strength are the variety of assignments to enhance writing skills.
98664,It was very difficult to synthesize the at-time random material although section did a good job of that. That material itself was very interesting though
98664,"Half way through the semester, the lectures became almost impossible to follow at all."
98664,"Lecture and discussion were both great, but the papers were graded based on writing style, not content."
98664,"This course was well, but I would teach it more chronologically"
98664,A weakness of this course was the lecture slides did not give enough information and were not clear.
98664,"Strong in its messaging, but very scattered lecture. Readings were very good/on topic though"
98664,"Strengths: The only history class I took was AP US History, so it might not be the same for everyone, but I learned so many things in this class that I would never have been able to otherwise. For example, learning about Britain, India, France, China, and Haiti's history was an eye-opening experience. Moreover, it challenged my views on history; for example, the current American Curriculum not elaborating on Haiti's contribution to US gaining Louisiana. Weaknesses: THIS IS NOT A GUT CLASS. 3-5 readings per week, a map quiz, a midterm, a final, and 3 essays, one of which is a final essay during reading period. I had to collaborate with two friends and make a 90 page Google Docs for this class."
98746,Strengths: good lectures  Weaknesses: sections where conversations sometimes felt circular and redundant. More guidance to make section conversations meaningful would be good.
98746,"Strengths: engaging lectures, amazing and knowledgable professor, interesting readings, clear feedback, flexibility with student feedback, great TAs, emphasis on participation and opportunities for group conversation, great guest lecturers Weaknesses: heavy reading load at times"
98746,"I really appreciated the weekly responses, because they held me accountable both to doing the reading, and also to forming an opinion on the topics at hand, which was often hard. Professor Beckerle's engaging lecture style was another big strength, because I liked the group discussions and hearing other people's interpretations--I felt as if it was a crucial learning aspect to the debate of human rights interpretation and implementation. I also liked that the reading responses were due on Tuesdays, and were open to that day or the previous Thursday's lectures; it forced me to synthesize the lectures mid-week, which was nice as opposed to a Friday or Sunday deadline."
98746,"Professor Beckerle is a central strength of this course (or, sadly, was: she will be leaving next year). She clearly cared about every student's learning and worked hard to cultivate a dynamic and inclusive lecture environment (she encouraged participation in the large lecture and sometimes split the lecture into smaller discussion groups). She also brought in very interesting guest lecturers. It is difficult to think of clear weaknesses in the lecture portion of the course. I did feel like discussion in section was almost never as productive or interesting as it could have been, often straying into stories and tangents that were largely irrelevant to the week's readings. Some of this (perhaps most of it) came from a lack of TA intervention when discussion veered off-topic. But I wonder if having a centralized course policy that encourages section discussion to focus primarily on readings would help make section into a space for real engagement with course topics."
98746,"Strengths: Great survey of human rights as a project.  Weaknesses: The section was weak, too much empty discussion"
98746,"The assignments (weekly response papers, in particular) were extremely helpful in facilitating student learning. The lectures were engaging and gave a good broad understanding of the issues covered. Sections were helpful in that, too."
98746,It would be nice to see other students work and have more collaboration throughout the year. Having weekly responses posted as discussion posts wouldve complimented my learning and engagement with classmates.
98746,"The strengths are that the lectures are critical and engaging to facilitate dialogue, learning, and inquiry. Through the lectures and the course materials, I gained a critical, multidimensional survey of the principles and politics that undergird human rights developments. I also found the course to be very accessible, especially because I did not have a strong background in human rights studies prior to taking the course. I also appreciated the wide array of course materials that were employed, including podcasts, news articles, academic journals, etc."
98746,"The course was arranged well and provided students with a fulsome overview of the human rights system locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally. The lectures flowed well, and Professor Beckerle was incredibly engaging. I appreciated the myriad of ways we could interact with course content, whether that was through lecture, discussion section, or office hours. Another major strength was that the course featured several esteemed guest speakers who shared relevant, real-life experiences in the realm of human rights. I also loved the range of readings; instead of just scholarly articles, we also frequently read news articles. The course could be improved via the provision of lecture slides and the addition of unconventional types of readings such as films."
98746,"Strengths: Prof is a great lecturer and the syllabus was very comprehensive for understanding the HR system; the TFs were great! The weekly discussion posts were a great way to stay engaged throughout the course and receive consistent feedback.  I think one way the course could be improved would be to provide the lecture powerpoints to everyone for accessibility purposes, as it can be hard to follow along with the lecture and take notes."
98746,"Strengths: gives a clear and consice background of the key actors that shape the UN and international human rights bodies. knowledge feels applicable to the real world weaknesses: too much reading, and having a section might not have been necessary since we made use of frequent class discussion"
98746,Professor Beckerle is amazing and the readings were great.
98746,"Strengths: engaging material and readings, covers a wide breadth of topics Weaknesses: class time is too short (50 minutes) to fully break down the readings we did for class, more of lecture style class and with only a handful of the same people participating. I feel like classes should be longer and engage the whole class more to understand these complex topics"
98746,"It had very few examples from the US. Obviously, this is not a US-centric class, but a common critique of human rights is that they are standards being thrust upon non-western societies. If there were more contemporary examples of how human rights interact with the US it would go a long way in dispelling that critique."
98746,I really loved this course. The one thing I would say that would be great is if we could get some feedback perhaps on our final paper before it is graded (seeing as it is such a high percentage of our grade)
98753,"Strengths - you learn a lot about a lot of different types of art and theories. Pamela Lee is a great lecturer. Weaknesses - the workload is pretty high if you're not pass/failing the class (section, readings, lectures, papers, and midterm/final) and there's a lot of content."
98753,"This class is essentially a crash course in the vapid intellectual fads of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Its perfect for anyone who is in need of the correct opinions as they move through the art historical discipline, but is not particularly interested in critically engaging with any issue. The metric by which artworks were chosen for the syllabus was largely informed by the variety of marginalized groups that could be wheeled out in discussing them. This resulted in a pretty dull and un-engaging class, I found."
98753,"I think your experience in this course greatly depends on your investment and level of engagement. As a CS major with an interest in art history, I found the tech lens to be fascinating. Although I could have gotten through the course with very little work or engagement, I spent my free time doing extra reading on some of the artists we studied.  Professor Lee is a starI always loved attending lecture and listening to her brilliance. If you can take a course with her, definitely do!"
98753,"Fascinating, relevant, and fun lectures, material, and discussions. I cannot think of a weakness."
98753,Honestly really liked the class. Would appreciate less memorization on the exams. Loved the trips to the yuag though
98753,"Strengths: The ability to go to the Yale art gallery to look at and analyze works of art discussed in lecture was incredible. Section was definitely a highlight of this class. The guest speakers were also an excellent addition and a highlight. Weaknesses: the course tries to cover so much, which is great, but I think it could benefit from discussing fewer works of art in each class. Lecture sometimes felt rushed (which is clear from the fact we often didn't make it through all the works). It also felt like the midterm grading was unclear and a bit arbitrary; clarifying the expectations / rubric ahead of the exam would be important in the future (this was done for the final)."
98753,"Strengths: the lectures are amazing! Professor Lee is always prepared and somehow manages to cover a lot (though not an overwhelming amount) in a fifty minute lecture.  Weaknesses: For a 100 level HSAR class, it is definitely a lot of work -- probably the same as 200 level art history classes."
98753,"Strength: I thought that exams were pretty straightforward, Prof. Lee definitely knew a lot about the class's content and taught it in a very engaging way Weaknesses: There is a lot of information to memorize but everything is connected so if you understand conceptually, it isn't that bad, lectures can be very fast (but you can watch recordings later), there was not a lot of teaching on how to write a visual analysis paper Other Notes: Know that the slides do not have a lot of information on them, you will need to listen to get information and context"
98753,"The lectures were very engaging and all the slide images provided a great visual accompaniment. I also really enjoyed the series of guest lectures.  In terms of weaknesses, the final exam focused a lot on the reading and this felt a bit incongruent with what we had done over the semester which was less focused on the readings. I think this could easily be improved by either focusing more on the readings throughout the semester or focusing less on them in the final exam."
98753,lecture includes more about NFT
98753,Strength: amazing lecturer and very interesting course content. Discussion sections are engaging and a great addition to the lectures. Weaknesses: Provide better guidelines for essay assignments.
98753,"Good lectures, interesting topics, cool guest speakers, fun trips to YUAG, not too much work. Just make sure to stay on top of the art you learn about each week (honestly just going to lecture + section is good enough for this), and this course is very enjoyable."
98753,Tests are just lots of memorizing which is hard and takes time if art history doesnt come easy to you.
98753,Strengths: great dedicated TAs Weakness: not enough structure
98753,"The greatest strength of this course were the in-person visits to the Yale art gallery; works of art are very different when viewed in person, and the TAs were great guides to how to view and interpret art.   A weakness of this course is the focus on memorization for the exams. The essays felt much more relevant and a better use of time, while the exams felt like memorization for memorization's sake, rather than truly interpreting the works of art and themes discussed."
98753,"Professor Lee is a great lecturer and the lectures were really interesting, although they were somewhat sparsely attended since they were recorded. I think it's a strength of the course that lectures are accessible in that way, although it would have been nice to have a fuller lecture hall."
98887,The psets were more helpful than lecture attendance in my opinion in terms of understanding the material. Professor Frank is an enthusiastic lecturer but often I felt under equipped to follow lectures without substantial help from youtube videos and textbook readings.
98887,"Strengths: cool material especially how NLP meshes with linguistics chances to actually apply all the stuff we are learning in assignments Weaknesses: long assignments, difficult with not an extensive CS background, material is often not very engaging, not a lot of feedback on assignments, office hours were tough to make"
98887,"Professor Frank is a terrific instructor and engaging lecturer. My only real issues with the course are that I'm not the biggest fan of group projects, and that the first (and last) time I went to office hours for help with a problem set, the ULA was unable to help me and seemed unfamiliar with the material."
98887,"Strengths: professor and course material, homework assignments were very interesting and fair Weaknesses: lecture slides were not very helpful to review if you forgot a part of the class or were confused. They are heavily dependent on live input from the professor during lecture."
98887,"The course covers a lot of topics with the expectation that you already have a strong background in linguistics and computer science. I would recommend taking courses in both of those areas before taking this course. Not necessarily a strength or weakness, but it will help you get more out of it."
98887,Strength: very interesting course material and structure. Weakness: hard to keep up without a background in statistics
98887,"Strengths: the material is fascinating, the grading is very lenient, and the P-sets are quite fun! And Prof Frank is always very helpful at office hours. Weaknesses: you have to REALLY know how to code, and you have to be quiet good at thinking mathematically. Many reviews of the course say it is better for CS students who are interested in linguistics than for linguists who are interested in CS...I don't think this is true, BUT the caveat is that you have to be a linguist who is mathematically-minded. I also wish lecture slides were uploaded to canvas BEFORE, not AFTER, classes, so that we could follow along with the slides in class on our own computers in case we ever miss some information. Of course, Prof Frank is always willing to go back to a previous slide if anyone asks."
98887,"This was an excellent course, the teacher is very enthusiastic and engaging, and there was a very reasonable courseload that helped to cement the concepts we learned in class. Having the final early to make room for the final project was very helpful."
98887,Lectures were very engaging. Professor Frank is a wonderful lecturer and did a great job explaining many of the technical concepts. I would have enjoyed a bit more exploration and explanation of the purely linguistic ideas behind a lot of what we learned.
98887,Professor Frank is fantastic and I found the course perfect in terms of knowledge/level and difficulty of homework/selection and depth of topics. Enjoyed the opportunity to conduct a final project as well.
98915,"The small class size (under 10) created an almost seminar-like environment. We were all able to ask questions of the instructor in real time and explain concepts to each other. We got to know each other quickly which helped us form study groups right away a very important part of math at Yale.  While we had each other to lean on, the course had very few peer tutors and peer tutor hours (which were all scheduled for very late at night too). It was disappointing to come to office hours for help with a problem set or to study for an exam and there would be 1 tutor for 30 students.  This course can be improved dramatically by offering walk-in/by-appointment math tutoring in the Poor-vu Center. It is rare to find a college that does not have a math tutoring center. Why is Yale gatekeeping success, when there are so many students who would be willing to tutor each other and lift each other up? I transferred to Yale for its strong resources and emphasis on collaboration, and I am disappointed in the apparent lack of those values when it comes to mathematics."
98915,"There are plenty of resources offered to better our learning, instructor was very patient and good with explaining, easy to follow."
98916,I liked the smaller classes. It felt more engaged with the instrutcor.
98916,This is just a basic calculus class
98916,Peer tutors were amazing and are the reason I did so well on my psets lol
98916,"I thought it was great. I think there could be slightly more effort in order to motivate students to be in class as this was not required, and although this is very helpful during busy days I definitely saw better results in times when I was going to class more frequently than when I wasn't."
98916,"Strength: it introduces you to calculus concepts  Weakness: for a person that has never take calculus before it can be difficult to keep up with the class, it's doable but requires a lot of commitment to learning"
98916,"The course covers a breadth of calculus-related topics, ensuring that I left this course with knowledge of an entirely new field of mathematics. The course also made efforts to level the mathematics playing field with review lessons for students who had only taken math up to pre-calculus (such as myself) while also offering abundant peer tutoring and office hour opportunities in times of midterms and exams. They were very considerate of our needs in practicing what we learned. The only issue is that the reliance of the course on problem sets makes absorbing certain ideas difficult, often I would confuse some topics of ideas because they were learned in a somewhat superficial way in class to cover more things."
98916,"Professor Geiger was amazing! They were very kind and attentive with in-class teaching. Overall, no other standout strengths/any weaknesses."
98916,"I think the course was a great way to get introduced to calculus and give students a steady pace on what calculus has to offer. The professor was great, and it helped me understand this math on a deeper level. If there is anything that could be improved, I would love to have more review sessions during midterms and finals, as I was not able to come for the full time with the times given."
98916,Strengths: derivative computer was helpful in ensuring that students knew how to properly compute derivatives - a crucial component for the latter curriculum. Weaknesses: homework problems didn't align with the difficulty of the practice problems we did in class.
98916,"The course did a great job teaching us concepts using examples and went beyond simple definitions to explore the mathematical basis of different theories. Each lecture was engaging and did not rush any learning point. The problem sets were very helpful and organized questions based on concept, and I really appreciated how frequent peer-tutoring sessions were."
98918,small class size was nice
98918,"Organized, and Professor Wu was helpful"
98918,One important strength is that there is lotsss of weekly support to help with psets which was incredibly helpful. One weakness is that I wish my professor was better at explaining the bigger picture of what we were learning instead of jumping right into it so i could better conceptualize it.
98919,"One strength was the smaller class size. I felt like it was easy to ask questions in class about concepts that we did not understand. It was a bit harder to study for the tests than I expected, though, because they did not give out a study guide."
98919,I thought the course was very well laid out and structured to encourage my learning.
98919,"The course could be improved through usage of a different room with different tables. At numerous times we collaborated with neighboring students, but since everyone had their own individual desk it was hard to push tables together and talk. I think teaching in a room with larger tables that students sit around would go a long way in helping the course."
98919,The teaching could be improved and there should be more readily available resources for everyone.
98919,Strengths- Explorations and concept checks  Weakness- lack of accessibility to resources.
98919,psets were only ten percent of the grade which was ridiculous considering how much time i spent on them every week even weeks we had exams. also the teaching was really variable section to section and it was super frustrating to see my friends in other sections having a better time
98919,Strengths were the usefulness of the content it covers. Weaknesses were that it was difficult to understand the first time around.
98919,"Strengths: super well organized, the math peer tutor hours are very helpfully placed, lots of resources for midterm and exam preparation, great exam review sessions, transparent resources, transparent grading/feedback, problem sets are consistent, ""exploration"" assignments which are basically previews of lecture content due the day before are lowkey helpful, office hours are helpful! Weaknesses: teaching varies greatly across sections!! this became very apparent during the review sessions which were hosted by different professors. the content felt rushed during the last few chapters."
98919,"Strengths: exams are not too difficult if you attend class   Weaknesses: some of the homework problems were not representative of test questions. They did challenge me to think above and beyond, though."
98920,This course could be improved by hiring passionate instructors that actually want to teach and care about student learning. There is a great discrepancy in the quality of some section instructors over others.
98920,"A strength of this course was that it was very well organized, and the class material + psets were similar to the exams."
98920,"Strengths: this course is very organized, and Rachel is such an amazing professor! She makes math easy and entertaining!   Weakness: none"
98920,I loved Rachels teaching style and the way she ran classes. I do wish there was slightly less supplemental material. It often felt redundant
98920,"This class was amazingly taught by Professor Diethorn (sad to see that she will be leaving). I think the review sections could be structured better and more standardized, especially for the final when the content is only being reviewed once."
98920,explores are very confusing before class
98920,I loved the smaller class size and the structure of the course.
98920,It was a very well organized course that sought to provide students with resources to help them.
98920,I thought the course was very well organized and found it easy to learn the content. Most assignments helped further my understanding but there were a couple of small assignments that were kind of useless
98920,"Strength: I loved how Professor Diethorn would carefully explain concepts in a way I could grasp. After learning the volume under the curve so many times, this is the first time understood how to set an integral for different equation boundaries. The professors are generally all nice and welcoming to people just starting math, and I would encourage taking this course as a refresher of math concepts or as a first math class. The cheat sheets we can bring for midterms and the final are also extremely helpful as well."
98920,"I feel that this course with my specific teacher did a good job in conveying the information for students to understand it. I feel that the lectures were engaging. As for weaknesses, I feel that the deep delve into ""why"" for certain concepts helps learning but sometimes they go on too long and take away from the actual application practice during lecture and requires even more work outside of class to fully grasp it."
98920,"I really liked the course in most aspects. However, the daily explorations were really painful. I never felt like they helped me learn. It was always a drag to force myself to complete them."
98920,The course is sometimes made very hard when theoretically could be smoother.
98925,"I like it that there's not many students in a section, which allows more individual attention. I hope that the course could be more interactive and take advantage of the small size."
98925,"The peer tutors were super helpful -- I went to their sessions every week to do my problem sets. I think it was good that the problem sets were significantly more difficult than the exam questions. The organization of the course, though, was more of an issue for me. I found it difficult that I didn't know who was grading my work and what their standards were, and the peer tutors didn't really know the professors and what they expected of us. To be honest, I taught most of the material to myself from online sources after class, which took extra time but was ultimately easier to understand."
98925,Weakness - variability in teaching skill. This course is very dependent on who is teaching the student; some teachers know how to break down concepts into digestible chunks for their students while others simply do not how to teach. This is very unfair to the student because some sections are better prepared for the exams due to having a better teacher while other sections are less prepared.
98925,"The professor wasnt good, I had to learn everything from the videos and psets"
98925,there is a bit discrepancy between the quality of the teachers that i completely stopped going to my own teachers classes and went to another teachers classes
98925,"I believe the greatest weakness is the disparities between the different professors that teach the course. I heard some of my peers had a really great professor that explained the content clearly, however I felt that I did not get the same quality of teaching. I would not mind that the class be taught in a big lecture rather than being split up into smaller sections because these differences in teaching styles made a difference in the final grade outcomes."
98925,- strength; structured and reasonable with clear expectations  - weakness: I wish the grading was curved
98927,"This course is very rigorous, and the problem sets definitely ensure that students are paying attention, but sometimes I feel as though they expect a little more knowledge than we are necessarily given. Certain problem sets this year definitely required students to go to office hours simply because they didn't understand the nature of the questions. The same could be said about the pre-class quizzes. While they don't count for much of the grade in the course overall, they do not seem to be very consistent in difficulty, ranging from not needing to watch the videos or reading the book to something akin to a multiple-choice problem set question on material learned supposedly minutes before beginning the quiz. This can be a very frustrating way to go into class, spending up to an hour watching videos only to get a 20-50% with little feedback before the second attempt. I think these should be structured so that students can get a decent grade just by watching the videos. It's a lot to expect out of students who haven't even covered this material in a classroom setting where they can ask questions. In a similar vein, the jump from problem sets to midterm exams is rather extreme in certain instances."
98927,"Strengths are they really teach the material well. The group work helps with this. I think this course should make the PSETS worth more. They take many hours a week and teach a lot, and its frustrating often to put in so much effort when you get little reward"
98927,"I appreciated the pre-class videos as a way to revisit/relearn content thought in class, but feel like them being mandatory plus the mandatory pre-class videos was a heavy workload because the videos were also often very long.   Strengths were the amount of extra resources: Xiemra videos + questions, office hours, peer tutoring, private tutoring. I liked that it was taught in smaller sections. Problem sets were very hard, but I liked that they helped you tease out kinks in your knowledge, which I thought was helpful. However, I spent a significant amount of time on psets (maybe around 6-8 hrs per week) and I feel like they should have been worth significantly more than 10% of your grade; that's also where a lot of really trying to learn the content took place.   Weaknesses: exams were significantly harder than the practice exams and Ximera quizes, so it was hard to gauge where you were at, which wasn't always too helpful in studying."
98927,I like the fact that there is no lecture. Instead the course is split up into smaller 20 person classes. Professor Argue is amazing and he was definitely the highlight of the course. He always comes to class with so much energy and excitement: it's hard not to enjoy the math! The peer tutors also did a very good job and I felt like there were adequate resources to learn the material. I also liked the pre-class quiz model where we are exposed to the material before class. The only weakness I can think of is that the feedback on problem sets could be a little more clear.
98927,"Well taught, plenty of resources, well organized and thorough material"
98927,"Strengths: well-organized, clear instructions and guidelines for assignments; Weaknesses: pre-class quizzes felt redundant, psets were very long and in-depth while not counting for much or being very analogous to exams."
98927,Spending more time on examples of problems.
98927,I think this course moved very quickly and it could be improved if every class was given worksheets/ notes.
98927,Strengths are the order in which the things in class are taught. All were given time to breathe
98927,"This course is good at providing support to students in need. It is fast paced, though manageable. I believe it could be improved with the provision of more optional practice problems with answers throughout the semester or with quicker feedback on the problem sets."
98927,I don't like the pre-class video format. I felt that the videos were meant to teach us everything and then the lectures help clarify rather than the reverse.
98927,"Pace could be bettered , lesson plans and ressources as well."
98927,The strengths of this course are the wide resources like Ximera they provide to allow students to get more practice outside of class.
98927,"Strengths: review sessions, the organization of the material, the way it is taught (as in the home video homeworks, then psets, then class time, then midterms)"
98929,"The way that this course is structured with pre class quizzes and basically going over what we watched in the quizzes in class is such a waste of time. The math department at Yale is faulty, and this course is evident of it. This course moves way too fast, it should be slowed down more. There would be times when we learn more than three to four new topics per week. It's hard to actually understand the content when the course moves at such a high speed. There aren't really any strengths that I can think of."
98929,The course is very fast at times and can be difficult to keep up.
98929,"Strengths: well-organized, lots of resources and sufficient support from TAs.  Weaknesses: Be prepared to spend a lot of time on psets. I wish they were weighted heavier on the final grade."
98929,The course doesn't move that fast and the psets are good practice for the exams which aren't too difficult.
98929,"Strengths: challenging but engaging mathematical concepts Weaknesses: limited resources for revision, particularly in preparation for exams"
98931,"I enjoyed the material, and there were several resources made available to make the material more comfortable for us if we were struggling. That said, the pacing seemed far too fast, and it was difficult to remember prior concepts because I didn't fully understand them before we progressed."
98931,"strengths: resources offered to the students such as peer tutoring and office hours weaknesses: in my past 2 math classes, I have had teachers that dont speak great english so they were hard to understand and they didnt explain the concept that well."
98934,"The course is very well organized, and has lots of support for students. Guiseppe is a great professor, who gives plenty of time in class for students to solve problems on their own or to answer questions, which is a great way to facilitate engagement. He also deeply cares about his students. Once, I came up to him after class with a question, and when he did not know how to answer it he sat down with me for 20 minutes until we both figured it out (and this was after class, when he had no obligation to be there!). Great professor and great course."
98934,Good intro into proofs!
98934,Strengths include academic rigor and beneficial problems sets. Weaknesses include harsh grading on specific aspects of exams.
98934,"Proofs are not something that everyone enjoys, but theyre definitely essential for higher level math!"
98934,"Strengths: the material of the course builds on itself well, especially how previous definitions and theorems can be used to prove later ones. Even though the course is proof-based, there are parts of the lecture that showcase applications, such as links to geometry or calculus. Weaknesses: the way this course is organized is counterproductive to student learning. Office hours are all early in the afternoon, when students most likely have other classes and commitments and thus cannot make it; when we do show up, we are supposed to work among peers most of the time and our questions/confusions aren't addressed in a reasonably timely manner. The lecture does cover all the basics, but some concepts on the psets are newly introduced but we are expected to understand and be able to apply them right away. The grading is sometimes needlessly pedantic, especially considering that this course is supposed to be an introduction to proofs. There is a marked lack of review material provided for any of the exams - there is only one short set of practice problems which are stated as not being representative of the ones on the exam (as opposed to a typical STEM class where you would get 2-3 tests from past years)."
98934,More development of proof-writing skills at the start of the course. More low-stakes opportunities to write our own proofs would have made the transition from calculation-based math courses much easier.
98934,The instructor (Giuseppe) and organixation was excellent. The content was also great and convinced me to take math. Instruction was the highlight.
98934,There are no clear weaknesses and this course is extremely well taught.
98934,It was good to learn about all of the concepts through lecture and the associated homeworks.
98934,"The material we cover is this course is interesting. However, I think it is taught in a way that does not allow students to fully engage with the material. Office hours and problem sessions were at inconvenient times so even if I had wanted to understand the material better, I did not fully have the opportunity to do so. I think if the class went over more examples, gave more step by step instructions, and reordered the lessons, the class could be truly interesting and fulfilling."
98934,I think it could have been made clearer which sections of the textbook corresponded to the respective lectures.
98934,"Instruction was generally very good, however content was a little rushed towards the end."
98934,This course was strong in connecting aspects of math to parts of life and show the merits of math as a field.
98934,The course was the perfect amount of difficulty for me to know that higher level math classes were not for me.
98934,"Strengths: The class does not go too fast, so it's very digestable overall.  Weaknesses: The biggest weakness of this class are the third-party grader. Contrary to almost any other mathematics class (especially proof-based ones) you're likely to take, the graders on homeworks and exams in this course care more about semantic ways to dock points off an answer rather than looking for conceptual understanding or creative ways to engage with material. This is especially egregious because the class places a super special emphasis on the process of mathematics and not placing yourself in a box when doing math. That makes a lot of sense given that this is a linear algebra course, and an introduction to proof-based math. It could be an eye-opening experience for many people to see what math is truly about, and with such a beautiful and perspective-heavy subject like linear algebra, the course could have fostered that environment of mathematical exploration. Instead, students are again put into that box come homework or exam time. You'd better have read the textbook word for word, because that it what they want to grade you on when it comes to recounting definitions or giving the ""as seen on textbook"" proof."
98934,"I thought the lectures were confusing as a lot was thrown at us without much context, thought there was a decent amount of resources available outside of class."
98934,"I think the distribution of points on the exams is not good, the exams had 3 true false each worth 6 points each so if you missed one or two your entire grade would suffer. I also think the psets should be graded a little less harshly considering this is an intro proof based class.  The strengths are definitely the instructors, they explain everything very clearly and are always very willing to help and encourage us to email them and come to office hours. The psets were also very instructional and solidified the content very well, and they weren't unnecessarily long."
98934,"strengths -- great professor and interesting subject topic, good introduction to proof-writing (coming from someone who had never written a proof before), and lots of revelatory moments over the semester about the nature of mathematics and connections between subjects; main weakness was lack of accessibility, most students I knew didn't bother going to office hours (like Monday 10am-noon??) and problem sessions seemed somewhat unhelpful"
98934,"I think the strength of this course lies in its ability to show students the bigger picture of why math is such an integral part of the world as we know it. At first, vector spaces seemed to be pretty narrow in applicability, but once we got to the matrix representation of a linear transformation, it became readily apparent just how wrong my initial assessment was. With applications in solving differential equations, analyzing functions, doing calculations for quantum mechanics and more, linear algebra exemplifies what math should be - a unifying force between the seemingly disparate concepts that govern the universe.  However, I feel like some of the richness in the later units (particularly with regard to eigenvectors onward) was cut short due to timing restrictions; we only had a few weeks to appreciate the power of the diagonalization techniques we learned. I would have preferred moving on from vector space and subspace proofs a little earlier in favor of exploring things like the spectral theorem and dual spaces in greater detail."
98934,"Weakness: even though this isn't the applications class, I wish there were still some applications because learning anything abstractly is difficult, especially for the first time, as was true for most students taking this class"
98934,"The strengths of the course are that it is a good introduction to writing mathematical proofs, it improves one's problem-solving skills, and it provides a solid conceptual basis for understanding and applying linear algebra. The weaknesses are that the content of the course is not particularly well structured, the instruction of the course could be improved, and some of the concepts could be made more clear and their application to the real world could be made more explicit."
98934,"I think the class is very well taught, only weakness I could come up for the class is that the cutoff for an A is very high"
98934,"The weaknesses of this course are really in the way the material was presented. There was not a clear connection made in lecture between consecutive ideas, and for someone who has never taken linear before, this made the class extremely difficult for someone who usually learns best in lecture."
98935,"Strengths: Focus on rigorous proofs Weaknesses: 1. The design of the course is very poor. Beginning with proof techniques is good, but as soon as that is over it begins looking at vector spaces. This makes linear algebra feel very irrelevant because we start getting deep into the weeds of the subject prior to learning its importance. In a past linear algebra class we began with just understanding linear equations and looking at why we even want to learn linear algebra. Then, we did some proof techniques, learned linear transformations, and then vector spaces, etc. This organization just made everything we were learning easier to understand its purpose. 2. The problem sets aren't that interesting until later in the course. Many of the earlier psets are incredibly tedious and don't add to understanding the material and feel like simple practice. Though I will say the later psets are incredibly good and effective (last 3-4)."
98935,"The course was well-balanced overall, and there were no weaknesses."
98935,Emphasis on proof writing was a strength. A weakness was that the linear algebra concepts felt too conceptual sometimes and it was hard to grasp what you're writing proofs about.
98935,Worksheets with definitions / theorems for each class
98935,"Strengths: material, problem sets, exams Weaknesses: lectures"
98935,Strength: PSets and exams were tough but fair and helped build understanding. Weakness: Lectures were poorly taught and often spent too long on specific proofs that were not relevant. Very difficult to build a conceptual understanding of the material from the lectures.
98935,"These teachers almost seem to have the goal of you having to learn everything by yourself. There are no TA office hours. The Professor office hours are unhelpful. The course was poorly taught so often I went into office hours needing a full explanation and they would expect me to learn by explaining it to them. There are problem sessions in place of TA office hours, where they go over practice problems, but they dont post solutions. I, like every other Yalie, cant make them because Im busy, and this I lose TA interaction entirely. This is made worse by the fact that they are not 1 hour sessions throughout the week, like other classes office hours, but two hour blocks on specific days, meaning if I have to miss it, theres not another one later that night to make."
98935,"The course was fairly well taught. I do not think it is wise (personally) to begin with the abstract vector space and linear maps, and then move to matrices - it would have made MUCH more sense to do this the other way around, in my opinion. The course content itself is very good."
98935,"Sometimes the lecture material seemed super confusing at first, but when I watched videos I found on the internet is was explained in a much clearer way. The PSETs were good in terms of helping to clear up the material though. The professors were approachable and happy to answer questions, which was nice. I thought the exams were usually okay in terms of assessing what we had been taught."
98935,It was taught well.
98935,"I found the way the class was taught, which was basically just following proofs, did not help me develop an intuitive understanding of the subject matterI often had trouble actually grasping what a basic term actually meant, since all concepts were presented in this somewhat un-intuitive proof format, especially given that I had no experience with proofs before coming into this class. I also think the order the concepts were presented in didn't make the most sense, since the beginning of the course featured the most abstract general concepts, which through foundational to linear algebra proofs, I think would've been easier to grasp a bit further on."
98935,"I felt like the professors could have done a better job at making the course interesting. It wasn't until we got to the end of the course that I saw how everything tied together. Also, the introduction to proofs could have been better. Professors not only needed to teach you the theorems, but tell you how they are used."
98935,It is a great class. I wish they posted solutions to practice problems. Otherwise it is excellent.
98935,I think notes taking was very helpful with learning the material.
98935,I think the teaching was very weak and the feedback/support was minimal.
98935,Lectures are boring and no engagement with proofs. Teaching of content was solid.
98935,Well organized.
98935,"I think it's a pretty great course. The material is interesting and it's the right level of challenge. It's a ton of material but I honestly think that's the right call. Only areas of improvement would be more dynamic lectures, but that's down to the prof."
98935,"The strengths were that the concepts were interesting, and the class was well organized. The biggest weakness was that the content was not taught very well. I often felt confused in class and the professors didn't always explain the concepts clearly."
98935,"Strengths: my professors was willing to help with problems and other questions throughout the semester, both over email and during office hours Weaknesses/Improvements: I think that it would be helpful to have proof writing workshops (like in Fall semester), because as someone with no background in proof writing, it was very difficult to go from the basic proofs in the beginning of the class that were supposed to ""ease"" us into proofs to the actual linear algebra proofs. I would also say it would be helpful if study guides that were more similar to the exam content were provided before exams. I appreciated the practice problems we received, but they were problems that were decided to not be included on the exam which meant some concepts in the problems weren't really tested on the exam. I also think it would be helpful to have office hours that are not predominantly during times when people have classes. A cheat sheet on the midterms and final would also have been helpful for all the definitions and theorems, especially ones that had many different properties."
98935,"Strengths: The homework assignments really taught me the skills needed to succeed, the professors were all very nice and supportive Weaknesses: The lectures were mostly here's a definition, theorem, and proof and were not always very engaging. The office hours were often at times that made it impossible to attend, and the homework was very hard to do without help so not being able to go to office hours was difficult. We also didn't have review sessions before the exams, and we had to memorize everything for each exam, which I didn't feel was very productive in us actually learning higher math."
98935,"I appreciated the abstract approach we took to learning linear algebra, because I feel that this generalization offered more power to the subject. For example, I like that we learned about vector spaces from a set theory perspective and analyzed their properties before discussing vector/matrix representations."
98935,"Improve: better time management (ie, fitting all the material into each lecture) especially towards the end of the course  Otherwise great"
98935,"One of the strengths of this course is that it is extremely rigorous, so I really had to put a lot of work and effort in. If I didn't, I think there's no way I could have kept up with the pace of the course because we went through a lot of challenging material in depth in a fairly short time. I think that one of the weaknesses of the course is that the first two weeks of the course, when we reviewed terminology regarding proofs before beginning textbook material, gave me a false impression that the proofs we would be doing would be fairly obvious or only a few steps. I think a disclaimer that the course would pick up and get much harder once we started material from the textbook would have made me more prepared once we got to that point."
98935,"I would say the strength of this course is a strong class dynamic, which does a pretty good job of not leaving students behind, with instructors staying behind after class to field any questions. However, I would say that the office hours were not really office hours but rather ""problem sessions"" which were often not very helpful."
98935,This course could use some changes in the pacing. The beginning portion was really easy and we spent a lot of time on it and it felt boring. If this time was more distributed to cushion the later harder stuff it could have been nice.
98935,"First of all, not all material in the class is covered. There are topics that are skipped so I feel like I didn't get the full linear algebra curriculum. I also feel like the class lacked intuition -- that is, it was heavily conceptual and difficult to understand at times."
98935,"This course spends time introducing linear algebra topics accompanied with proving these concepts. These proofs are very difficult and are sometimes very abstract. A possible modification to this course could be introducing visualization of the concepts into the lessons. Lessons were taught very algebraically and were never really given a picture/physical representation that made them easy to visualize. Because of this, I had to look elsewhere to begin to understand the uses and intersections of the topics."
98935,"The grading is this course was indelibly frustrating at times especially with how nit-picky the points taken off are on psets and tests. I think it was taught well, Ovenhouse was a good lecturer, however the structure of the content often made linear algebra more confusing than it needed to be."
98935,"I did not feel that the course was well structured to support student learning. To clarify, I enjoyed Prof. Ovenhouse's classes and thought that he was a clear lecturer. It was more the organization of class as a whole that was frustrating. Before the before the first midterm, the initial plan of the instructors was to not release solutions to the practice problems. It was only upon numerous student requests that they were given. In math, timely feedback is essential to improvement, so I don't understand this reasoning.  Further, on days where Prof. Ovenhouse was absent, we would have the other instructors come to substitute. When Prof. Martone taught our class, many people were very lost. He went too fast, assumed we understood too many definitions, and failed to explain well. It did not feel like the professors were entirely on the same page."
98935,"Strength: Nick is amazing at explaining concepts and answering questions. Weakness: No outstanding weaknesses to be honest. It's not an easy course, but anyone who puts in the time and effort and asks for help will manage."
98935,Videos that followed the content like they do in math 120.
98935,"The main strength of 225 is that learning the language of proofs and sets was interesting throughout the class. Some of the proofs while very challenging were interesting to come to an understanding of and it was interesting to be able to stack proofs with every subsequent one being able to be proved by ones learned before. However, I felt that the way the lectures were structured prevented me from learning from them as many focused heavily on the proofs for theorems without adequately explaining what the theorem does or how certain aspects lead to the proof. Also, the majority of office hours were structured during times when I had classes. I find it a bit counterintuitive to have math office hours scheduled at the same time as physics class time as many physics majors take linear algebra at some point in their college career. The class also doesn't provide any idea of how to solve the problems to the peer tutors making it harder for them as they have to come up with ideas on the spot to help students. This all led to the majority of what I learned coming from either the textbook or videos on youtube rather than class resources. Finally, reading feedback or answer keys on proofs was sometimes confusing if you didn't understand the proof as they tend to be too vague to piece together what you don't understand. Overall, the class is trying to cram so much into one semester that it ends up making most of it unintelligible and when you try to get help for the class, there are unnecessary barriers in the way."
98935,"The strengths of the course involve the opportunities for engagement through office hours, problem sets, and practice materials for tests, as well as the emphasis on the development of proof-writing and argumentative skills. The course introduced a completely new area of math that is helpful for higher level courses.  A weakness of the course was the lack of in-class practice, as most theorems and proofs discussed in class were intended to develop a base understanding, but did not necessarily build your ability to tackle the more complex (less-straightforward) proofs on both tests and problem sets. This resulted in exams not always being congruent in difficulty level with in-class practice and even problem sets."
98936,"The strength of this course was the breadth of topics to which you are exposed. Additionally, learning the proofs and rationale behind different theorems is very helpful in understanding the concepts. It would be helpful if they could post the solutions to the problem sessions, however. I couldn't attend them, and the problem session problems weren't as helpful without the associated solutions. But overall, it was great."
98936,"Strengths? Couldn't tell you.  Weaknesses: instructors, course material, peer tutors, psets, grading, lack of review sessions, lack of practice problems, lack of clarity on what's expected, question 1 on psets, useless help sessions This course needs restructuring, better instructors, and please, for the love of God, some competent peer tutors (I don't know all of them, I've heard Supriya is good)"
98936,"I think the course was organized pretty well, although I didn't appreciate how the office hours were all in the morning/early afternoon on weekdays, as I wasn't able to attend nearly any of them."
98936,I thought the office hours were very inconvenient for people with extracurriculars
98936,"The course was very inhuman, and felt very isolating. In addition, there were no resources to help with homework, which were sorely needed."
98936,"I think if someone was very interested in proofs and linear algebra they would succeed in this course, but everyone else is very unengaged and struggled in the course."
98936,We could focus more on the more challenging theories in class. Also having a more specific syllabus in terms of what chapters and sections will be covered is beneficial as we can read ahead
98936,"This course is terribly taught. I had to write a 600-word complaint to the DUS just for them to force the professors to release answers to the practice problems. Imagine telling your students ""There's no need for an answer key, you should be confident in your answers"" while removing the cheat sheet that was standard in previous offerings of the course. Just a terrible course in general and the professors need to get a grip on the reality that they are teaching an introductory math course and not some higher-level one. If the statistics were available somewhere, I could bet that 225 had one of the highest credit/d/fail rates in all of Yale. It also confuses me why they would teach Gaussian Elimination as one of the last few topics in the course when everything they taught before it could have been simplified via Gaussian Elimination. At the end of the day, I didn't need this course for my major, but I pity those who do because they are not in for a fun time. Also, it is important to note that the syllabus has listed the cutoff for an A at 95 and there is no curve in the class. If you lose 2-3 points consistently on the PSETS you are already flirting with the A/A- range."
98936,"Strengths: engaging material, fun problem sets, engaging lectures (even if they were a bit fast sometimes) Weaknesses: lack of communication with ULAs and students (about problem sets, tests, etc.)"
98936,"I think the instructors behind MATH 225 were great but the organization of the course could greatly be improved. In short, the instructors of the course should take a better look at how the MATH 120 and MATH 115 calculus classes are taught. Before every class, readings followed by a quiz that accounted for 5% of your grade were required and this helped me show up to class far more prepared to investigate the content of the class in better depth with the professor than if I did not have those quiz materials. Due to the abstract nature of proof based linear algebra, I think this kind of enforced advanced preparation would help students be better prepared."
98938,"excellent, really good teaching"
98938,Very solid class. Provides enough foundational knowledge to self-learn other topics and derive how different statistical tests/models are formed.
98938,"Strengths: Great course and presentation of material. PSETs were perfectly correlated with the lecture content, and the course itself was highly cohesive in promoting learning. Weaknesses: legitimately none that I can think of"
98938,Some of the homework questions could have been more clear on what was expected
98938,"Strengths: The professor is a great lecturer and very nice. The material is explained well, even though there is a lot of it, and the problem sets and exams are manageable. The TFs were also helpful and supportive. Weaknesses: The material is very dense and hard to follow at times, and discussion of applications was usually saved for the end of the concept, which made following the proofs difficult and confusing some of the time."
98938,"Loved that the professor was very engaged, kind, and offered a lot of office hours. Could have used a programming exam, grading was harsh and exams difficult. Definitely the hardest class I've taken so far at Yale and required a lot of time and energy. Interesting but do not take if you are not required to."
98938,"The class is well taught, but at the same time is a very intensive introduction to the subject for undergrads with not much prior stat experience. The class is also accessible (recorded lectures, posted notes, and corresponding textbook readings), and you learn a lot through psets"
98938,"Strengths: professor wooster is powerfully engaging and excited to teach the material (with a strong, math-focused background in the field), recorded lectures, everything was proved live (as opposed to slides where too much info is thrown at you very fast), instructive psets, fair exams. Very well-organized course overall (especially given that it was Wooster's first time teaching the course).  Weaknesses: Gave Zhou Fan's material as practice for exams (which was brutally difficult to the point of discouragement) but Wooster's exams were much fairer in line with the content that was taught. Oddly, the final felt more like a calculus exam rather than a stats exam. 9am on Marsh..."
98938,"Professor Wooster is good at explaining concepts and the textbook is very closely connected to lectures and the problem sets. The demonstrations in R were pretty straightforward, but may have been difficult for people who did not already have experience in R or any computing language. Takeaways from/enjoyment of the homework might depend on whether your enjoy deriving formulas or not."
98938,"I took this class last year (when it was taught by a different professor) and had to retake it, so I can confidently say that Prof. Wooster is an outstanding lecturer that is a very good fit for this class. His pure math background made him give us a deep appreciation for these concepts with scarce handwaving involved, but at the same time it rarely felt like we were lost in the proofs. It's rare to find such a perfect balance of mathematical rigor and big-picture conceptual understanding.   The course content is also very readily applicable. Although 99% of what we learn mathematically is available in R, the way this course is taught actually helps because, more than just proofs, we deeply understnad the assumptions embedded in those commands as to avoid common statistical pitfalls. I gained a deeper appreciation for the field after this class."
98938,The class was overall well organized. Topics were well introduced and explained.
98938,"The homeworks were relatively straightforward, but the exams were tough -- if the tests were one-to-one with the difficulty of the assignments I think I could have gotten more out of this course."
98938,"Strengths: rigorous course material and advanced mathematical concepts covered, I feel more prepared for next set of advanced statistics classes. Weaknesses: given the difficult material and technical concepts covered in the substantive readings and in lecture, I was surprised that there was no required section mandated outside of the lectures each week."
98938,"The strength is the amount of support that we get. I couldn't survive this class without the daily office hours options and Ed Discussion. I never feel like I am alone in this class. I never understand the content, but I'm not failing because I have opportunities to get help. There are always office hours whenever I need them. For me the weakness is just the content really, it is really challenging but that's really just a fault of my own. I feel like the exams are unreasonably tough. They are always tricky questions."
98938,"Made the theory very clear by giving many examples, but can incorporate more with real-life usage."
98938,"Strengths: The course had a relatively straightforward form. Some of the ULA's were really helpful. Weaknesses: The course is really, really, really challenging. I think the content is too much for a one-semester course and I thought there was a big gap between what was taught in class, what appeared on problem sets and what was tested on exams. I wish the course could focus on a little less topics and have more realistic expectations about what students are supposed to grasp by the end of the semester. I also didn't find Professor Wooster's teaching particularly helpful."
98938,the course does not have powerpoint only handnotes the exam is difficult
98938,Strengths: 1. good material 2. the professor is very passionate. 3. Problem sets are helpful to understand the material. Weakness: 1. I prefer powerpoint slides rather than hand-written notes 2. Could give students more intuition about some concepts rather than just prove it.
98938,can help me build more solid foundation in theoretical statistics
98938,"The lecture hall was a bit too big for the course so at times you felt like you were so far away from the instructor. Overall the material was well-prepared and the exams were fair. Weakness is all the undergraduates they let teach the course. They do not know the material that well and are always rescheduling and shifting their office hours. That is the bare minimum, be at your spot, every week for 1.5 hours, if not, do not teach the course."
98938,This course is very good
98938,"Strengths: Professor Wooster was one of the most accessible and helpful professors I've had at Yale. He himself held five hours of office hours and also had a huge team of ULAs and TFs. Concepts were also taught quite well during lecture.  Weaknesses: Textbook we used was not great and the professor may have assumed better existing student understanding of how to work with probability distributions and confidence intervals. However, certain corrections for this were made for this after the midterm!"
98938,"The strengths is Bob. Bob sets a high standard for teaching talent. I tried to nominate Bob for the teaching prizes but it said that the professor had to have worked at Yale for at least three years, so you guys better nominate Bob in two years. Bob made lessons very illustrative and clear with constant examples and interweaving proofs and problems to great effect. Like an ideal math professor, Bob literally clarified almost everything he wrote down in the course, which proved super helpful during lengthy derivations. His notes were absolutely great, and he would always hand write them and update them timely. He always made a point to make sure everyone was up to speed and regularly solicited questions. Bob also did a great job constantly referencing topics from other lectures in a different lecture and tying similar topics together, which made understanding the context of a topic in the statistics universe a lot easier. He provided practice problems very relevant to exam content and difficulty, lots of supplementary information like illustrative examples in R, and held literally four office hours per week what the. Bob was elegant and quick on his feet when answering student questions, delivering them well formulated responses. He is kind, humble, welcoming, funny, responsive, and overall a great guy, one of my top three professors at Yale out of probably like 50 I've had. Yale's other STEM professors (especially math and stats, jeez) would do well to take a page out of Bob's book, and he is the ideal exact kind of new professor that will ensure Yale maintains its academic edge into the future.  The only weakness is that Bob is not teaching other courses that I want to take! (inference and machine learning and advanced probability) because the current professors leave much to be desired. I wish I could learn machine learning from Bob, this man would carry me into the future of AI. Did you read this review??? Give this man a promotion and a raise!!"
98938,"This course has a wide variety of resources and office hours to assist learning. Professor Wooster himself had office hours 4 times a week and there were around a dozen TAs/TFs who had their own designated office hours distributed evenly across the week. This course does a great job of teaching many different core statistics concepts as a knowledge foundation for future courses in the major. That said, lectures sometimes consist of long derivations that are fun to learn but may hinder instruction of formulas and procedures that are used on assignments, which occasionally made coursework unnecessarily difficult."
98938,"I thought the class was put together well, lectures were very helpful and psets were fair compared to what we were doing in class"
98938,"It is good, but the exams are challenging."
98938,"Bob Wooster always writes his notes live, which is really great because the pace of the class is not artificially fast or slow. The exams are also fair. Some of the problem sets near the end could have been more challenging- some were just a collection of simple exercises in R for which we already had very analogous example scripts from class."
98938,Prof. Wooster is an amazing lecturer. His lectures were very clear and organized. The pets and exams were fair.
98938,"Strengths: Professor Wooster is super patient and explains things very clearly. Hes also super accessible and hosts a lot of offices hours each week.  Weaknesses: I think the homeworks, especially after spring break, were a bit too trivial and I felt like I didnt have as good a grasp on the post-spring break material."
98938,"Strengths: Bob is a fantastic lecturer, interesting and pretty light problem sets Weaknesses: lecture was at Marsh at 9 am"
98938,"This course needed to move more slowly through less topics. In one semester we covered the entirety of the Rice introduction to statistics textbook, which meant skipping interesting ideas in each unit, meaning each statistical unit/framework (estimation, hypothesis testing, goodness of it, etc.) was grasped in less depth. Obviously there is not enough time to do everything, so rather than doing many things rather hastily, it would be better to do more proofs in class, and train students to be able to (re)produce proofs themselves. Another weakness of the course is that OH was basically reserved for working on Psets, and it was hard to find time to ask actual questions about theory (sometimes only Professor could answer such questions, and it was hard to get time to ask in depth when every OH became Pset Q&A). The strengths of the course were the underlying material, the hypothesis testing unit, and Professor Woosters overall upbeat, infectious personality."
98938,"Strengths: Wooster is a good lecturer, psets are fair Weaknesses: couldve had more practice material for the big exams"
98938,"It is hard, 9am is terrible but the recordings were good."
98938,"I didnt attend class but lectures were recorded and lecture notes were very detailed and explained concepts clearly, so it was easy to learn outside of class. OH was very helpful for PSETs."
98938,The format of the course made it easy to stay on track week by week.
98938,The lectures are a bit boring. I wish we looked at more interesting applications than fake R examples.
98938,"Better tfs because there is so much material it is impossible to understand stuff after one go. Ed discussion and Professor Wooster help, but they arent always available"
98938,I thought it was taught and structured well.
98938,"Solid course with good curriculum, but could have been more engaging and had more clear expectations."
98938,"no weaknesses, all strengths. very good course"
98938,"All strengths, I felt like this course was really designed to facilitate learning well."
98938,"Wish the lectures were a bit better organized, similar to 241. Was at times very hard to figure out what was the most important ideas to understand from a lecture."
98938,"Bob is a really great lecturerhe explains things really clearly and doesnt assume a ton of math background (though ofc you should have taken calculus and 241). I had taken 241 a while ago and was still able to get up to speed quite fast,  The HWs were also really helpful and edstem responses were super fast"
98938,"Strengths: The course is well-organized and all the material follows a clear theme. I also liked the real-world examples used in lecture.  Weaknesses: Sometimes we spent a lot of time in class just going over R code. Since the level of knowledge of R required for problem sets wasn't super high, it was difficult to find the motivation to put 100% attention into following the lecture when going over code."
98938,I wish there were more engagement with the course in terms of meeting other students maybe a peer tutor would be helpful??
98938,The course tries to mix statistics with proof-based mathematical rigor. The lectures are very proof-based while the homeworks are a mix of application and proofs. I didnt find the class that engaging and would have appreciated if the class had a faster pace and we had a better understanding of the course outline.
98938,"Strengths: Dr. Wooster is a great lecturer! I really enjoyed this class taught by him, and I appreciated the abundance of practice materials made available before exams. Weaknesses: I did feel like the difficulty of the practice materials was not comparable to the difficulty of exams, so it'd be helpful to have more accurate materials going forward."
98938,The course was taught pretty well overall.
98938,Use slides instead of handwritten notes to avoid inefficient use of lecture time and typo.
98938,Bob was great- love this man- but hes also bit harsh with level of difficulty. Hes willing to explain everything though.
98938,"Strengths: Wooster is really great, the problem sets are appropriate length and challenge and were always relevant to the course  Weakness: the midterm tested topics that were taught that morning in class. That was really unfair in my opinion."
98938,Everything in the class is great.
98938,Maybe providing a review of linear algebra would be better.
98938,"Pretty well structured and full, although I think the inclusion of R was not very smooth because it was mostly changing various parameters in the sample code, so not much learning about R was done. Granted, this course is not a course on R. It would be quite successful as an introduction to the R language though."
98938,"Strengths: good professor, reasonable P Sets. Weaknesses: somewhat difficult class."
98938,Nice
98938,"This course is very good at teaching fundamentals of statistics and expanding on a solid base of mathematics, as well as giving a basic introduction to R. I think it could perhaps have gone a bit more in depth on some of these things at the cost of breadth. I often felt that it was hard to really understand the details of the many many formulae we were given, and the occasional proofs were nice, but often approached with the perspective of needing to get through them when they were actually among the most interesting parts of the class. The r parts of the class could also maybe be expanded"
98938,Professor Wooster was an amazing intructor. His teaching was clear and he gave me a solid understanding of the material.
98938,Instructors' handwriting is difficult to understand
98938,Strength very detailed Weaknesses maybe include more real example
98938,The lectures were very well organized and clear. Professor Wooster is a great lecturer who is very approachable and clearly explains statistical topics
98938,Very well-structured course--I liked the book and the flow of the material was great. I thought the exams were well constructed and appropriate to the coursework.
98938,I liked the material as it spanned many important topics
98938,"Class time could be improved by spending less time on super detailed sections, with more emphasis on how things fit together. For example, the last class where we went over how everything fit together in the grand scheme of things was super helpful, so it would be great to have small tidbits of that sprinkled into regular classes."
98938,"Robert Wooster made thorough notes in lectures and was active on EdStem, often forming long threads of back-and-forth Q&As. While the class moves quickly, psets are doable with the help of office hours, and the midterm and exam were both fair or even easier than pset problems. I walk away with a stronger intuition about the fundamentals of statistics, but I didn't always find lectures to be the most intuitive. In the second half of the class, lectures often finished with some demos in R, which I always struggled to follow or gain intuition from watching. Perhaps more static slides (ex. a graph of the chi-squared distribution at different degrees of freedom) and fewer live demos (ex. generating the graph live, but we can only see one at a time and might lose track)"
98938,"The distribution of the course contents is even, but different topics can be better connected."
98938,"There are too many technical proofs that do not matter. Assign them in the reading, spend class time doing problems more like our PSET problems"
98939,"Strengths: material was explained clearly in class, topics covered were interesting and built on each other. Weaknesses: a lot of lecture time was spent working through long examples, and because of the layout of the room, everything had to be copied twice, which effectively gave us half the time we would have had. There was also no syllabus published, which was inconvenient at times."
98939,"strengths: pretty light workload weaknesses: professor is quite unengaging, lack of things you usually see in a class like communication, don't even think we had a syllabus, also final went terribly, most ppl couldn't finish at all"
98939,"Honestly, it needs to be completely reworked. The pace of the course should be faster, there should be more emphasis on the proof side because realistically right now it serves as just a slower more tedious version of the ENAS ODE and PDE class. Also, homework assignments should be graded and submitted online and there should be more than 1 ULA."
98939,"The strength of the course was that the Professor is very experienced and therefore explained the material very well. The real weakness is that the content can be very dry at times and also very confusing, so you just sort of have to go with the flow even when things do not seem to make complete sense."
98939,"The content of the course is clearly well-established and fundamental, but it is taught ineffectively. Our professor walked between two whiteboards every class, copying down what was on one to the other. This halved the useful time we spent in class, leaving us with many uncovered topics at the end of the semester."
98939,"Strengths: solving diffeqs is fun, it's kind of like sudoku or crossword / how well you do is proportional to how much you practice and that's it. There's not much brain behind the class, just hard work. But you do learn a lot of interesting historical background on some of the diffeqs while reading the book, and it's also very useful for other classes like Physics. Weaknesses: impossible to finish the exams on time (both midterms were 50 minutes in-class), un-engaging and very boring lectures because the professor kept rewriting everything on the second board, forced to print out PSets instead of using Gradescope. I also wish we got to cover systems of diffeqs which are a very important topic that I will now likely have to self-study over Summer because the class couldn't get to it in time."
98939,"By the end of the class I did feel like I knew how to do most differential equations. Professor Moncrief was nice and pretty fair. Sometimes, however, he would skip over a lot of steps in class when doing example problems, and so I wished that he would go into a little more detail on how to fully complete a problem."
98939,The lectures were not engaging.
98939,"Strength: The content itself is very straight-forward and the problem sets are taken directly from the textbook.  Weaknesses: 1) There is very little communication about the grading distribution, dates of the midterms, and generally about the course until very last minute because Professor Moncrief does not use Canvas regularly to make any announcements. He would tell us the dates of the midterm the week before in-class, making it hard to plan out the semester if you have multiple exams and you would also completely miss the announcement if you happen to miss that class. 2) The midterms are quite difficult, especially because there are so many more questions than it is possible to finish in an hour. Everyone looked quite frazzled by the end of each exam. 3) This is not a weakness for the professor but for the registrar/admin. The room was way too small for the class. ODE is a pretty foundational course for many different majors and in every lecture, people were standing or sitting on the floor in the way back of the room without a desk, pulling chairs from different rooms etc."
98939,Just read the textbook by yourself. Lectures were super boring. The professor wrote everything twice because there were two whiteboard on opposite ends of the room.
98939,"Good course but pace was a bit slow, could have had more on syllabus"
98939,"I would have appreciated if more information had been posted to the canvas page (including a syllabus, exam dates and topics, and other materials), and if we had used online submission platforms for problem sets like gradescope. Printing and delivering problem sets proved to be an enormous hassle."
98939,This class is a nightmare. No syllabus was provided (which I am pretty sure goes against Yale policy). Lectures are boring and it is difficult to understand his handwriting.
98939,"The main strength of the course is that it closely follows the textbook so it is very easy to study for exams and review information. Not to be rude, the main weakness of the course was Professor Moncrief, whom I had trouble hearing during lectures. I had a very hard time engaging with his lectures, that went very slowly, even though I felt like I was not getting much out of them."
98939,"Strengths: Pretty chill, professor is cool  Weaknesses: Had to submit on paper which was inconvenient for everyone (at this point everyone else uses either Canvas or Gradescope)"
98939,Lectures need vast improvement. Psets need more thought.
98939,"The course included great supplemental resources, with the textbook explaining all necessary course material, and videos also being available for developing understanding. Another strength of the course was its organization, as the introduction of topics was structured for a smoother understanding. A weakness of the course is that there was less chance for engagement, partially due to the amount of content. Having more opportunities for doing practice problems during lecture, and doing test practice could be helpful."
98940,"The PSETs were challenging, even with a thorough understanding of the lecture material, and the exams were extremely challenging even with a thorough understanding of the PSETs and lecture material. The course notes, though, were a superb resource and should be implemented for all math courses!"
98940,"I loved your course (in all honesty), but I believe the following can be improved:  1. I think it will be nice to NOT skip any section of the book. Because a lot of the materials assume that you know previous materials, it was very hard to follow later on. For instance, we have not covered how the limiting process works for a sequence of function in a pointwise manner versus and uniform manner. And yet, we had a homework problem and midterm questions on them.   2. I think it would have been nice had there been less homework. To be honest, I was busy doing homework even when I did not fully understand due to the reason stated above. For many students including myself, I had no choice but to finish the homework. I believe all students taking MTH 255 are well motivated students, and I think it will better in future instances if students had to worry less about homework load.   3. The course progressed too fast. I think many students moved onto practice problem before knowing how to prove theorems. I doubt if students can prove FTOC from scratch to be honest. I think the design of the problem set and exams encouraged many students to know how to solve problems without fully understanding the materials."
98940,"Strengths -Psets are intense, but you learn how to do rigorous proofs. -Lectures are good -Professor Neitzke was a great lecturer -A lot of resources, such as ULA sessions and office hours Weaknesses -The parts on calculus, were quite rushed, we developed integrals in the last 3 lectures or so, and the fundamental theorem of calculus on the last day, I know this is the goal of the course, the FTC, but it would have been nice to have another lecture on it, especially since it was on the final. But otherwise, great! -Midterm II was harder to prepare for, it was a lot more difficult, average was 74, compared to ~87 on the first midterm."
98940,"It was incredibly fun to look at math I already knew and more rigorously understand its origins. One of the biggest positives was that the new content came mostly through proof techniques while seeking to prove ideas that we had already known to be true. Taking this course truly allows to understand the real numbers in completely new ways. This is not necessarily a weakness, but I would warn students that the first 1/3 of the course may be significantly easier from the latter 2/3, with the jump in difficulty being relatively sudden, so anyone taking this course should be prepared for that."
98940,"Lectures were clear and organized, homework problems were applicable and of good length. Sometimes it felt like there was a significant jump from the lectures to the p-sets and not enough resources on general proof strategies for different kinds of problems."
98940,Prof Neitzke is absolutely incredible and does a fantastic job of explaining the course material and answering any questions that come up. The psets are an appropriate difficulty level and greatly improved my understanding of the material.
98940,"Strengths: wonderful professors (for both sections), ULAs, and TF. Lots of resources to help us succeed and a very communal/collaborative class environment. The material was well-paced and the exams were difficult but fair. Weaknesses: the only real weakness was that grading was pretty slow. Though the professors always made solutions available, which was super helpful, it could be hard to assess mastery of the material (especially before midterms) when we didn't have a lot of problem sets back."
98940,The strengths of this course were the problem sets where I learned how to apply the concepts we learned in the course notes and lecture notes. The weaknesses were that I wish we had more time to complete the problem sets so i can think more deeply about the concepts being asked in class.
98940,"The lectures were engaging and interesting, the material/notes were posted after class, problem sets were directly related to the topics related and corrected in a clear way (the feedback is really helpful to make progress in the class)."
98940,"Super great teaching in class and office hours, very useful problem sets to learn from, logical and well-paced structure."
98940,"I think that this course helps a lot with building intuition and deriving proofs from that intuition. The course is well constructed so that students thoroughly understand a topic before utilizing it in later chapters. I think that the difficulty of problem set questions could be changed to better facilitate individual proof writing. As it stands, there were some proofs that were unreasonable for this level of math, so students were essentially required to get large portions of the answers from ULAs or office hours. I remember one proof taking over an hour for a ULA to write out completely. Overall the difficulty was reasonable, but these outliers meant that when I struggled, I was less likely to continue working the problem as I knew it was possible that I would never be able to come up with a solution on my own."
98940,"Strengths: the notes and materials repository is so organized and built to support student learning. It's clear to me that the profs put a lot of thought into how best to help every student learn, because you can review everything we cover in the online notes, plus go above and beyond by looking at the example sections within. I always felt well supported in this class.  Weaknesses: they assign psets even on weeks with midterms. That ended up being quite a bit of work, sadge."
98940,"This course was fantastic--there are few ways in which it could be improved. With that said, I felt that the material from the beginning of the semester could have been taught at a slightly faster pace to allot more time to the more challenging material at the end of the semester."
98940,"The difficulty of psets felt imbalanced. Some weeks it felt almost unbearable while in others I had extra time I wished I could be donating to more difficult weeks. The strengths were the curriculum and open-ness of content. There was a pdf of the entire course notes, which was amazing for reviewing and learning. It took a lot of the pressure off of writing everything from the board into the notes, and instead I could listen to what the prof was saying."
98940,"The PSETs are very helpful practice, and I really liked that they provided extra problems too! It was a shame that we didn't cover the entire syllabus, maybe a faster pace would get us there next time."
98940,"The course was very well organized, with material being taught in a logical order. There was a lot of support from the professors, the TA, and the peer tutors, which was super helpful."
98940,"This course was great! Neitzke's lectures were awesome, exams were fair, and homeworks were challenging enough to help learn the course content. I feel like homeworks tended to be graded slightly harshly, but besides that, the class was super well structured!"
98940,The course was very well-taught with an energetic and thoughtful professor. The problem sets were engaging and will force you to stay on top of the material. The topics themselves are interesting and give a fundamental understanding of calculus.
98940,Homework not representative of exams.
98940,"This course was very well taught, and for the most part the test and homework questions were fair/ reasonable (with the exception of one or two homework problems, and test 2 was a bit too difficult but the grading policy allowed us to replace it with the final). I really appreciated the office hours being available at many times, and having two sections coordinated with two professors allowed us to go to both office hours. The workload was what you could expect from a reasonable pure math class. The only complaint I would have is the difficulty of the problems in test 2 and the difficulty of one or two of the homework problems (which I think the instructors are aware of which ones based on feedback from other students). Overall this was an interesting course! It was challenging enough even if youve seen the material before, but not so difficult that it was unapproachable for a newbie (though it is a fair amount of work)."
98940,"I think lecture and office hours were generally fairly well handled. It did feel like there was a lot of support for the immense challenge this class often posed. That being said, I do think the feedback loop of this course was difficult. While solutions were consistently posted after a while, actual feedback on work was spotty and often took a long long time to get back. For a course with a good amount of building, this was very frustrating as a student. I also sometimes felt like the pacing of the course felt fast, though this could just be a personal issue."
98940,It was wonderfully curated and organized!
98940,"The course is well taught and organized. I liked Professor Neitzke's enthusiasm about the course material and found his lectures very engaging.  The course does come with a rather hefty component in its evaluation; there are weekly psets, with no exception, and the two midterms are each 3 hours long. I sometimes felt stressed about this, and would hope to see a more relaxed approach to evaluation in future iterations of the class. I also think the course was a bit unevenly distributed; we spent a week for each important topics, such as limits, differentiation, and integration."
98940,"Strengths: Neitzke, fantastic lectures and notes. Weaknesses: None."
98940,Good notes
98940,Great typed lecture notes provided by Prof. Neitzke. Lots of example problems and resources available to help students.
98940,"I loved this course! I wish it wasn't so difficult, but at the same time, the problem sets were engaging and fun! Just a lot of time!"
98940,Strength was the engagement of the professor with the topic and teaching students. No weaknesses.
98941,"the PSETs are proof based on while the proofs are logical, they often don't make intuitive sense. The professor provided class notes online which was nice."
98941,idk bro i didnt go to class. neitzke notes goated
98941,"The course was taught with a lot of support; TA's, ULA's office hours really, really helped with problem sets and I should have taken advantage of them more. The material 'flowed well' - I didn't ever feel completely lost in the sauce (of all the material that needed to be covered). However, simply by nature of analysis, we had to go through multiple theorems/concepts without proofs, but the profs did their best to accomodate students along the way. It felt rushed, and we were often told to 'check the notes,' but even then, there were not many examples of applications until the notes were developed more later. However, I am extremely satisfied with the teaching itself and the professors' emphasis on interactive learning. Regardless of exam scores, you will 'learn' how to approach a theorem/problem with strong intuition if nothing else."
98941,"Strengths: a ton of resources and support, challenging but fair problems sets/exams, great and understanding professors. Weaknesses: class can be a bit dull sometimes, and there was not much incentive to come to class since the content that was covered was in posted lecture notes, and either way it felt like I needed to self-study the course."
98941,"Strengths: Prof. McAdam was a wonderful professor. She is kind and knows the material exceedingly well. The lectures were well organized and full of examples, which are very important in math. Office hours were accessible and helpful, and the online Ed Discussion board was as well.  Weaknesses: Other than slightly slow grading, none. It was a difficult class, but I wouldn't call that a weakness necessarily."
98941,"Almost all strengths: Taylor worked with a pedagogical partner and we say certain helpful things implemented over the course of the class. We had useful in-class quizzes and discussions that helped expand my understanding of analysis. This was perhaps the hardest course I've ever taken, but I really enjoyed it throughout!"
98941,"Strenghts: Taylor is fantastic; problem sets were hard but well-made; great resources; Neitzke's lecture notes were incredibly organized and detailed Weaknesses: homework grading could be faster, as classes are over and I haven't gotten my grades back for 4 out of 13 problem sets. The course is very fast-paced, particularly over the last weeks, but there's not much to do about this given the amount of material that must be covered."
98941,strength: very well organized weakeness: feedback on assignments took quite some time
98941,"I feel like we spent too long on countability and ended up losing out on some pretty important concepts in analysis, ie power series"
98941,"There is a lot of material, and often it is just taught in rapid succession more as a list. In addition it will often be the case that you have to make an intuitive leap to solve a problem, and otherwise you are pretty hosed. A strength is that there is a large amount of outside of class options for help, though they vary in helpfulness."
98941,"Strengths: the professors were great and the course was taught at a good pace, weaknesses: grading was very slow at times and many grades were not released even when final grades were due"
98941,"Strengths: great centralized notes, great problem sets and very fair exams. Great practices tests and exam materials.  Weaknesses: one too many psets maybe. Pset evaluations come too late."
98941,strength was depth of content
98941,"The strength was how well organized it was and the availability of notes and help. I cannot really think of any weaknesses, except for maybe the homework was graded a little slowly."
98941,hw could have more down to earth human answers (answers that a student would come up with)  The recitation was at an inconvenient time
98941,Strength: lecture notes are very detailed  Weaknesses: topics appear on midterms and finals have never been practiced by students via psets or practice questions
98941,I should have done more exercises when preparing the exams
98941,The major strength of this course is its rigor in developing each concept and it gives us a flavor of fundamental mathematics.
98941,"The course notes were very helpful and were taught in a clear, predictable way. Additionally, there were plenty of office hours between both sections and the TAs were very helpful."
98943,Strengths: Prof. Oh is an amazing lecturer who makes concepts easy-to-understand.  Weaknesses: I wish Prof. Oh was more open to discussing course material more with students. She held office hours once a week and at a very inconvenient time.
98943,Great course. The exams were fair and I believe Hee Oh taught all the material well.
98943,"Strengths: Although this might be a weakness for some, the course was fast-paced and ensured that lectures were never boring; the class was taught at the level where you need to give your full attention to Prof Oh for the entire 75 minutes. The lectures were very organized, and the homework was informative. For what is generally known to be a 'hard' math class, Prof Oh made this class very accessible, explaining concepts really well with intuition. Weaknesses: None really."
98943,Hee Oh is a very good lecturer
98943,"Professor Oh did a good job giving us intuition for what was going on, even though lectures were often quite fast-paced and technical. Also, the ULAs were fantastic!"
98943,"Strengths: Professor Oh is a great lecturer; super clear, engaging (and fast!), sweet, and really cares about our enjoyment of the material and class. Even though the sets at times were extremely difficult and overwhelming, especially at the beginning of the course, they were really interesting and cool problems. Felt like every problem was teaching something different. She lightened the psets over time and as exams approached. The exams were also a lot less intimidating than most closed note math exams I've had at yale. The graders were fairly nice. Weaknesses: Sometimes the class went a little too quickly, and every now and then it felt like we were proving more than we needed to. Also the homework was stressful."
98943,"The course homework were quite relevant, though there were a couple of problems that were too long. I think though the course was overall quite strong."
98943,"Strength of the course is Hee Oh's lectures, which are the most engaging lectures I've had of any course. On a very honest note, Hee Oh's lectures in Math 305 are the one class where I actually attended every single class, because of how good they were. Her exams were also very fair and tested on the important skills we developed in class. The ULAs were also very helpful with pset help. I guess the only weakness is sort of the grading; even though the grading was very fair, it would be useful if there was more reasoning for some of the points being marked off. Sometimes, there was a specific reason mentioned, but other times, the comments just said ""score modification"", which didn't really explain much."
98943,"Strengths: very interesting material (and much better structure of content), Hee Oh is a very nice person, midterm was very reasonable and final was not nearly as bad as last year (based on what I heard); Weaknesses: I wish the lecture notes were posted, sometimes I give up on the psets and rely on ULA office hours because there are some non-trivial problems"
98943,"The biggest strength of this course is Prof. Oh, who is a fantastic lecturer. The only weakness I can think of is that some of the homework problems could have been chosen better (there was one, for instance, that to the best of my knowledge required several intermediate theorems that we did not cover in class)."
98943,"I believe this is a core math class, so you learn helpful proof skills and techniques. Lectures in general were pretty good, though I spent the majority of them pretty confused because Professor Oh goes quite fast. One improvement would be if there were more office hours held by the professor, and specifically to ask questions about the psets. I could not attend the ones Professor Oh had because of a conflict with another class, and they happened before the next pset was released and after the previous pset was due."
98943,The course is excellently organized. The material is presented in a very digestible and thought-provoking manner. My only suggestion would be uploading the lecture notes on canvas to help relieve the concern of not having everything jotted down which decreases focus on the actual discussion.
98943,"The lectures are absolutely perfect, and the problem sets complement the lectures nicely in that they require no new knowledge outside of what was taught in lecture, but are more challenging than the lecture proofs. I think the exams also had adequate difficulty, but it would be okay if they were a little more challenging."
98943,"Professor Oh is a great lecturer, her lectures are very clear. It can be hard to get to know her outside of class, however, because her office hours are during the 4 hours a week that we don't have a pset. Holding office hours during a time when we have a pset would make me feel more comfortable coming to them, because I would know that the things I was confused about were important."
98943,"This class was wonderful and opened my eyes to so much new math (and the brilliance of lebesgue integration), but it was HARD- prepare for this to dominate your semester. Pset nights were a religious but sleepless experience, you will go to office hours always. You will experience highs and lows you have never felt before. However, it is graded very generously, and effectively just on completion (at least for the midterm) as far as I can tell; wonderful for your GPA, not so great if you want to be a rigorous mathematician."
98943,"This course has very interesting content and the lectures are very good, the homeworks are interesting but became so difficult on a few questions that office hours explanations felt basically required"
98943,"Fourier analysis is really fun. However, we didn't really get to it until the last 1/4 of the course, when it would've been nice to spend more time on it rather than spending time only on measure theory for the rest of the time. Professor Oh is a brilliant lecturer with a good sense of humor who helps you feel at home in the classroom, and it was very helpful when she summarized all the topics you'd need on exams the lecture before each exam. Quite a few weaknesses: There were no review sessions, practice problems, or other resources to help practice and prepare for exams outside of the problem sets. Professor Oh's office hours were during the one part of the week when there was no problem set assigned. The problem sets weren't uploaded to Canvas until the very end of the class, making them very inconvenient to access. Similarly, since questions weren't linked to pages on Gradescope, it was difficult to view feedback on problem sets."
98943,This class is required. The content is required to understand higher math.
98946,"I think the strengths are that Professor Kenyon was very enthusiastic, kind, and a great professor. The weaknesses are that sometimes the homework was long and repetitive."
98946,"great job, but more discussion about things like SU(2) and SO(3) would have been better"
98946,"Strengths: Kenyon was very sweet and chill, and I liked that he got to know us individually as students. Some of the material was really cool (graph representations of different groups) Weakness: Kenyon didn't seem prepared for the lectures, and would spend a long time proving small things and gloss over important things. The homework were also really variable. Some were four questions and others 10-12. A lot of the homework was also very repetitive and uninteresting (no, I don't want to prove something is a group/subgroup/ring six times in a row). They also didn't reflect the material from class very well, which made it hard to know what to study for exams. The psets were also out of very few points, so when the graders took off for minor errors, it meant a pretty big deduction overall. I was overall a little disappointed, and feel I have a lot of holes in a really foundational subject in math."
98946,"The curriculum and pace of the class were great, there were a lot of examples to help us understand more abstract concepts. The class could have gone more into detail and left more time for rings towards the end of the semester"
98946,"I think mostly the content is just not what I'm most interested in. Abstract algebra is certainly abstract, and maybe just too abstract for me. The further into the course I went the less I cared about what we were learning, which was bad because the difficulty also ramps up hard. I can't really bash the course to much, more so I just don't think it was for me, and it may not be for you. That being said, its pretty foundational for a lot of math, so if you are thinking about taking it, you will probably have to anyways."
98946,"The course is extensive in that it covers a lot of material. To me that is a good quality, especially when the subsequent pure math courses that heavily rely on the principles built and learned in this course."
98946,The course covered a variety of interesting topics. It started as very easy and then became quite challenging.
98946,"Strengths: Both the homework and exams were of reasonable length and difficulty. I really appreciated that in a class with a historically overwhelming workload, Kenyon made it much more manageable. Weaknesses: The content of this course was sometimes taught slightly out of order, and often theorems and content that would appear heavily on the homework would be glossed over in class. It sometimes felt that class was more of a supplement to reading the textbook than the other way around."
98946,"The course has a reasonable workload. The problem sets and exams are very reasonable. Also, Professor Kenyon remembers the names of people who attend the lecturers, which is super nice. The main weakness is that some of the lectures could have been better organized and prepared."
98946,"The introduction to rings at the end of the course felt very definition-heavy and not as satisfying as some other courses, especially because there are so many more rich areas of group theory that are, in my opinion, more interesting."
98946,"The class was well taught but harshly graded: there was little to no partial credit awarded and problem sets were a little too short, making small mistakes hurt your grade more than necessary. Otherwise, weekly psets and exams were both well administered and well-designed, although I do wish there were fewer computational questions."
98946,"Professor Kenyon was the great strength of this course. His incredibly clear and concise teaching style allowed us to dive deep into complex topics, turning intricate proofs and technical derivations into straightforward concepts we could intuitively replicate. The problem sets are a fantastic complement to the material covered in class; Professor Kenyon has selected an artful combination of challenging questions about each topic, so that after every problem set we feel like we have mastered the material in that section."
98946,"Strengths: Kenyon is a very good lecturer and makes the class interesting.  Weaknesses: As a smaller class, it is a bit less organized, as there were no lecture notes which made it difficult to catch up when I missed a class."
98946,The lectures were great. The homeworks were of good length. It would have been nice if Prof. Kenyon had published class notes.
98948,"I felt like the problem sets were fair but somewhat repetitive towards the beginning of the course. I also thought that the exams were a little bit too short and computational so making a few silly mistakes made a big difference in exam scores. I did feel like office hours and the outside of class support was very strong. Another weakness was the lack of a main text to follow, it would have been very helpful if there were lecture notes made or recorded lectures since there was no central book."
98948,"good professor, good content"
98948,"Its a hard course. Miki does a good job with it, not sure what else can be done to make it easier."
98948,"The strengths are Miki's attention to teaching and detail. Her pre-class exercises helped me practice the material; the lectures were clear, engaging, and cogent; and the homework assignments were well-crafted to be good practice without being tedious. One of the best courses from one of the best instructors at Yale."
98948,"Strengths: Miki is an incredible lecturer (though a little speedy for 9am). Weaknesses: The exams were vastly different from the problem sets, making it quite difficult to prepare for them. The workload wasn't too bad, but it was deceptive since doing the problem sets was nowhere near enough to learn the content well. It's easy to neglect the class and fall behind."
98948,"Miki is a fantastic professor, and the content is really satisfying."
98948,"Strengths: So many! Miki goes above and beyond in so many ways to make this course fun and manageable, and you'll learn and grow a lot when you take it. Weaknesses: none."
98948,"Miki is a good lecturer, and the course is very well structured."
98948,"Strengths: very well taught, interesting and useful homework, accessible course staff  Weaknesses: built up to one main result (the Galois correspondence), then the rest of the course felt like ""oh and also x y and z,"" never staying on one topic for longer than about a class"
98948,"Strengths: Miki is a great professor, and classes are quite engaging with a lot of student participation. it also does feel like we come full circle at the end when we cover how to create arbitrary galois groups and do all the casework for intermediate subfields."
98948,"It's a Miki class so you know it's going to be taught super well, with a very caring professor. Honestly, take any class you can with Miki, she's one of the, if not the, best prof at Yale."
98948,Lectures were very clear and engaging and the homework was quite interesting.
98948,"This class was well organized and there were plenty office hours and review sessions. However, the pre-class component sometimes felt to not be very helpful."
98948,Miki's 370 is well-organized and things are taught one step after the other. The important theorems and results are well-presented in class and reiterated many times during the semester so that students will not feel lost. There are also a few occasions where Miki gives refreshers about results in 350 to help students understand what part of 350 might be the most involved results in 370.
98948,"Strengths: Very interesting and fun course material which uses the tools from abstract algebra to prove stuff about cool things like which n-gons are constructible! Also I would argue that it gives better intuition about what groups are/what they are used for, which motivates a lot of the stuff you probably learned in 350. Miki is also an incredible professor and makes the whole class fun. Weaknesses: none."
98948,"I think the course was very organized, and there was a lot of support. I think it would be helpful if you could post your lecture notes, especially because some of them aren't in the textbook. I tried my hardest to take good notes, but sometimes I wouldn't understand things and so I would write things down that were wrong, or fail to notice things that were important.   Some minor things: A lot of people took 305 and 370 at the same time. The 370 office hours conflicted with 305 class time, which meant a lot of people couldn't come. Also, the only people who are taking this course are math majors who feel that it is important to them. So long as it doesn't conflict with another important math course, we will take it whenever it is offered. I would have much preferred to take it at a different time."
98948,"The primary strength of this course is the professor. Miki's lectures are very engaging, and she responds to students questions very precisely and with concrete examples. The course is also very well-structured, to the point that students understand exactly where each lecture fits into the larger picture of the curriculum. Also, there is ample support for students in the form of office hours and review sessions for exams.   Finally, a major strength of this course was the problem sets. They were very challenging, but not impossibly so. In general, it was possible to work through at least part of a given problem before having to attend office hours to clear up confusion. The difficulty level of the problem sets was ideal for growth in students' problem solving abilities."
98948,"Strengths: wonderful professor, extremely well organized, fascinating content, beautiful math Weaknesses: can be a bit fast-paced at times, 9AM exams are ROUGH, lectures are very fast, and the class overall can be very time-consuming (depending on mathematical background and general speed with learning new math) Improvements: don't schedule it at 9AM? or at least make the midterms in the evening?"
98948,"The structure of lectures was great, with interactive participation included. Also, there was a lot of support from the professor and peer tutor, who were fantastic! The material was very well organized and the progression of ideas made a lot of sense."
98948,"Strengths: Super cool topic. Miki is an amazing professor, and you should take any class she teaches. (Also, go to her office hours if you can.) She also chose a fantastic ULA who was an absolute pleasure to work with. There were plenty of review sessions and resources available to at once practice this new material, prepare for exams (you know *exactly* what to study for each exam, unlike in some other classes...), and brush up on stuff from Math 350 as needed. Grading was very fast and comprehensive (no one-sentence comments). Weaknesses: Miki's office hours were all held either right after class or during Math 305, which was frustrating considering I had a daily language class right after this class. As far as the course topics went, they seemed a little out-of-order/arbitrarily arranged, at least while you were going through the class, though it isn't like that made it difficult to learn or anything. Be aware there is quite a lot of work, but definitely not as much as in Math 350 (assuming you took it with Miki)."
98950,The prof nicely developed the material so everything connected. It was helpful to have a textbook that aligned well with the course.
98950,"Grader (not prof) was incredibly tough on partial credits, leading to very low numerical grades. It distracted from my enjoyment of the course material itself."
98950,"The content was very interesting and moved at the right pace, although the lectures could have been a bit more engaging. Some of the problem set grading was also unnecessarily harsh."
98950,"Strengths: very visual, covered a lot of content, and fun applications to machine learning and physics. Only five psets throughout the semester.  Weaknesses: we covered a lot of content very quickly, and it was difficult to internalise some concepts in the time given. More importantly, the grader was a nightmare and was overly petty with deductions. Also, the only office hours were given by the instructor once a week."
98950,"Strengths: I think the content is a huge strength, because I think up to this class there aren't many classes (or at least, I haven't seen/taken many classes) whose focus is solely on geometry, and a lot of the content is grounded in visual/real-life intuition which helped me understand concepts in a way that, say, I haven't gotten as much from algebra classes. (You draw a lot of nice pictures! And shapes! Those were strengths in my book.) In my instance of this course; I really appreciated professor Park for always giving new directions to think about, always giving references for future reading, and just being very willing to answer questions with depth. I also really appreciated the 2-week psets (again, particular to my instance), since I really got to dive deeply into a few problems rather than scramble to finish a problem set every week. Weaknesses: this is again particular to my instance of the course; but the only real downside was that I felt that the grading was often pedantic and punitive. Just to give a sense of the vibe: the grader one time went back and took off points from everyone else's problem sets because someone had made a regrade request and the grader for some reason deemed it worthy to punish them for it (at least, this seemed to be my sense of the situation). You also had to know and use Latex because the grader basically wouldn't accept written solutions. Again, this is particular to my year, so probably something that'll change in the future, but the grader practices seemed not well defined/founded."
98957,Strengths: knowledgeable TFs Weaknesses: not enough practice questions for exams
98957,"Strengths: Doesn't require a large amount of week-to-week engagement. Generally interesting material. Focus on climate change is fascinating and extremely valuable.   Weaknesses: Sections. This course should not have section meetings. They are almost a complete waste of time. A format where TFs hold an extended group office hours one day a week, such as on Sundays from 1pm-4pm, where students can go discuss the lectures and ask questions about the material, would be far more effective. Another weakness were the exams, which varied drastically in difficultly (exam 2 being absurdly difficult relative to exams 1 and 3) and were graded unreasonably stiffly by the TFs.   Course would be dramatically improved if one midterm exam were removed and instead replaced with a creative project or presentation that students could research, complete, and present in section. This would have the advantage of both eliminating the unnecessary 3rd exam and making section meetings even marginally useful or stimulating."
98957,"Strengths:  The TAs - they were all so knowledgeable and helpful, section was well thought out and enjoyable.   The material - the course covers a broad range of topics such that I do feel I have learned a lot.   Exams - these exams feel like they break the course up nicely, I appreciated not having giant cumulative exams.  Weaknesses: Changing Professors - this was a very difficult part of this course for me. I felt that once I had learned how to learn from someone, there would be a new professor. While all were very knowledgeable in their fields, I think that the neurology and virology units were a bit difficult to parse due to lecture style.   Exams - these were also tricky die to how the course was broken up. The first exam was great, it covered all material taught in the first unit. The last two exams were over three units and I found it hard to switch gears between teaching styles, content, etc. Ideally these would correspond to a unit, so there would be four exams."
98957,"I feel like lectures moved quickly and most of the time, I learned better studying lectures on my own than in class."
98957,I think the exams should come with a study guide since often times the information that was rarely mentioned in the lectures made up a majority of the exam. I also think that each lecturer should be required to provide the information needed to answer the learning objectives at the end of each presentation as a way for students to study.
98957,"This course was great in the discussion sections where it talked about the social net impact of using different scientific technologies but its weakness lies within the amount of material within each lecture and it gets very difficult to keep up with. I found the exams to be difficult because I did not take biology in high school and because the exam was memorization heavy, which was not my strong suit. However, for someone with good skills in memorization, this class might be good for them. I wished the class had psets that served as review and for that to weigh in our grades instead of the exams weighing 60%."
98957,Cool to have rotating lecturers. Sometimes a little more consistency between them would be nice
98957,"Interesting, get to hear from many different professors which is cool"
98957,"Lectures were not very engaging, but section was very engaging"
98957,Strengths: the different instructors and topics  Weaknesses: The lectures werent always very engaging
98957,"The main weakness of the course if the inconsistency of the difficulty level. Some topics and lecturers were easy to understand, while others were less thorough."
98957,"I think conceptually the idea of highlighting the social aspects and impacts of biology is a good one, but I didnt feel like those themes were emphasized as much through the assessments which focused heavily on simply memorizing scientific facts and figures."
98957,I like that we had different professors. I hate that the tests were on wednesday.
98957,"This course provides a lot of great information, but with that being said it is a lot of information. It felt as though there was so much going on that the main objectives were sometimes unclear."
98957,Sections have no connection to course meterial they feel like a waste of time
98957,Lecture slides were well put together
98957,This course definitely provides a simple introduction to Biology for non-science majors. The learning objectives and variety of lecturers and perspectives was helpful.
98957,"To further the exploration of various biology perspectives, my discussion section was amazing, and I was able to have an interactive experience through asking questions to guest speakers and touring the Peabody Museum."
98957,I think this course could be improved with providing better practice materials
98957,Honestly the course is pretty good as is.
98957,"some of the concepts are pretty hard, despite being for non-stem majors. Some things were not as simplified as they could have been for an intro level class. The prep and support for the units on neurons, for example, should not have been as in depth as it was."
98957,Strengths: genuinely interesting Weakness: some lectures were repetitive
98957,"Strengths: Processes are presented in understandable ways and tests are pretty fair as long as you've thoroughly reviewed course content. Sections also cover super interesting topics and don't add extra stress to the class.  Weaknesses: Because there are different instructors, you have to adjust to different teaching styles throughout the semester. They also vary in how much information they put on slides."
98957,The strength of this course was the section material that we would go over every week. It was great to have a seminar to discuss key concepts that we learned in lecture. The weakness of this course was not having more consistent assignments to keep track of my learning.
98957,Strengths-structured lectures with clear key takeaways Weaknesses- the discussion sections were often unrelated to the lecture and not examinable
98957,The lectures could be more engaging considering it's an intro class
98957,I really enjoyed the class so I dont have any weaknesses to describe.
98957,"The course was great! I kind of felt the first unit less directly applicable to policy related questions, but I understand why we started with it nonetheless. I think there should be clearer instructions about what to study before the first exam (eg. What experiments are important to remember about for the exam)."
98957,"I think one strength was our conversation during discussion section. I really liked debating the ethical concerns surrounding interesting topics like gene editing and vaccines. However, it was frustrating at times because very often the conversation we were having in discussion section did not have anything to do with what we were currently discussing in class. Thus, although I was interested in the topic I often wondered why I was learning this material if it did not correlate with our class discussion."
98957,I liked the course structure.
98957,There could be more opportunities in section and outside of class to review the material and prepare for exams.
98957,"Strengths: pretty simple to understand, good lecture slides, section was fun and low effort Weaknesses: not always very engaging"
98957,"Well organized, fair workload, fairly engaging professors."
98957,Strength is wide ranges of topics covered. Weakness is inconsistency in course load due to numerous professors.
98957,very good overview of subjects! unfortunately sometimes felt like professors were reading directly off the slides
98957,"For the last two exams, there was a lecture of material covered two days before that was not included on the review sessions. There could have been better review for that material, or that lecture could have carried over to the next exam."
98957,"Lectures werent recorded, pure memorization for exams so if you like that then this class is for u"
98957,"Overall the course was very strong, although the sections sometimes were somewhat not very related to the content in lectures and tests."
98957,"I really do think lecture can go over my head sometimes, especially during the pain unit. Most of the content I had to teach myself."
98957,"Strengths: Well directed towards non-science majors. Weaknesses: Some of the lecturers were more engaging than others, and one went really fast."
98957,They made great applications to the real world and how we can apply this knowledge.
98957,"- strengths: a lot of interesting content, good sections - weaknesses: too much content in lectures, not enough review, focus on memorization, no constant update about progress in class"
98957,"The course covered a broad range of topics that were very interesting, although given this broad expanse of information, the exams covered a lot of material which was difficult to study for. Additionally, discussion sections covered their own discussion topics rather than the material covered in lecture, so clarifying the material from lectures was a little difficult."
98957,"Strengths lay in the lectureres, the structure of the exams, and the guiding questions at the start of the powerpoint. Weaknesses lay in the sections and the lack of consistent difficulty level across the different lecturers."
98957,I LOVED discussion section and felt that the activities and guest speakers were an especially engaging part of the course.
98957,I think its cool how the course has several units on topics very relevant to our lives and that our discussion sections bridge topics to ethics and our daily lives
98957,Strength: non-cumulative exams Weakness: discussion sections could cover more direct content from what we learn in class
98957,"strengths: i was in the ""experience science"" section, which is one of the best sections i've had yet at yale. i really enjoyed exploring more of yale as well as meeting experienced researchers in different fields weaknesses: most of the lectures were not too engaging, but as long as it was relevant to exam content, it was okay"
98957,Love the course structure and the discussion sections are very beneficial.
98957,"strengths: some cool topics, some good lecturers weaknesses: you think this is going to be a gut and then its not which is annoying. One guest lecturer was also absolutely abysmal."
98957,I felt like I wasnt learning in class so I stop going the teachers would just read the words on the slide and move on
98957,"I honestly really liked this class, despite having heard from many people the contrary. I learned about a lot of things that I feel like should be just basic knowledge. I'm really grateful for having taken this class; I gained a lot of knowledge not just from the lectures but from my discussion section as well, both of which were very engaging. I also felt like the exams were very appropriate for the class. Yes, they required some studying, but they weren't impossible at all. All of the questions came basically directly from the lecture slides, so nothing asked was a surprise."
98957,"The interactive discussion section was absolutely amazing! It allowed us to see many parts of science at and around Yale, and the instructors were extremely understanding of all of our questions which further developed our interests. Having 4 professors teach the different course topics was an interesting change of pace yet aided in differentiating the material and generally worked well."
98957,"The lectures were irrelevant to the course since the speaker frequently (almost every time) read from the slides word for word, adding little to no outside commentary or explanation."
98957,The strength is how organized the course material is. The expectations were clear and that was very helpful for me to study and engage with the material.
98957,"I really liked the course. It was so accessible - the course felt very welcoming, and like no matter my previous knowledge I could show up and do well. I liked the exams, they were very straightforward, and I felt like I knew exactly how to study for them. The information we learned was interesting, and I especially liked the more interactive elements, such as the active learning activities we'd do with Professor Paulsen. I wish that the other lecturers incorporated more of activities like this in their lectures, that would have made it more engaging! I also thought the whole unit on COVID was not as engaging, since we have all already lived through Covid and don't want to hear any more about it. That being said Prof Zimmer was a good teacher, and I did like learning the language about mis and disinformation. My favorite part of the class was the experience science section! The highlight of my week."
98957,"I think the exams should better reflect the content discussed in class and discussion sections, it seems the exams were much more biology focused and sometimes questions were hyper specific on topics lightly covered in class."
98957,"Overall, it was a great introductory course. The first and last sections (intro to cell life, climate change, and COVID-19) were fascinating and well-taught! The neurons section of the class was NOT it. The lecturer flew through the dense material without much explanation of the content. It was difficult to understand and the one weakness of this course."
98957,"Strengths: It's...relatively easy to do well in the course. All of the necessary information you need to pass exams are included in the ""learning objectives"" included on each slides presentation, which was SO helpfully when it came to organizing information and studying. The slides were a great resource to have to return to after lecture.   Weaknesses: The way that the exams were timed throughout the semester, I would have 3 drastically different topics on the same exam, which would make studying sort of time-consuming and difficult. The questions on the exam would also sometimes ask quite specific questions instead of broader questions that would better reflect my learning."
98957,A strength are the section activities. There were some well-structured debates. A weakness is the clarity of the lectures. It can be hard to tell what is super important and what isn't when taking notes in the moment.
98972,stop answering questions mid class
98972,"Ron is a phenomenal professor and is clearly very passionate about teaching.  Pace could be improved. The tangents were interesting but also often unnecessary, and we didn't end up getting through all the content that we were supposed to get through."
98972,Strengths: Professor Breaker is a great lecturer and takes the time to explain things very clearly. TAs are also very helpful and straightforward about how to prepare for the exam.   Weaknesses: We did not get through as much of the content as I would have hoped and it was a bit rushed through the end of the course.
98972,I would attend peer tutor hours instead of the TF led teaching fellows. Breaker was an engaging lecturer.
98972,"Strengths: great content, lectures were extremely informative and well-explained, often medical relevance was explained for topics which was engaging Weaknesses: sometimes there were too many minute details crammed into lectures, which made it hard to know what to prioritize for studying for exams; sections were not as helpful as I would have hoped (I generally engaged more with TAs via asking questions over email because sections were often a lot more general/just kind of skimmed over the entirety of the lecture at a high level); no homework which was hard because our entire grade was determined by exam performance and there was very little provided for practice questions"
98972,I think if recordings were posted/there were other assignments other than exam it would have been beneficial.
98972,A strength is the amount of diagrams and images that helped me visualize the concepts in the slides. A weakness is the level of detail that some of the slides went into because it made it hard to track which information was very important to know and what details were less relevant.
98972,"strength: very organized and you know exactly what will be showing up on the exam. The TFs are great and VERY generous graders. weakness: Having four exams can be a lot but honestly, not having a final is GREAT. And the exams are not bad at all if you prepare enough and go to lecture."
98972,"Strengths: Professor Breaker delivered the course material in a way that made it readily comprehendible and spent some extra amount of time explaining the more challenging concepts of a given topic. We covered a lot of information in the course, and I feel the exams weren't overly demanding by requiring us to know relatively obscure topics of lecture. Identifying the extra information on the slides was also helpful to reduce the amount of time spent preparing for an exam.  Weaknesses: The timing of the lectures could be improved. For example, we ran out of time to cover all of the intended information before the last exam, and were made to review some of this information on our own. Further, I stopped going to the optional discussion sections as I found it more worthwhile for my time and understanding to review individually and then just asking the professor for clarifying information after class."
98972,I thought this course was very well structured and the way the professor taught the lectures was very descriptive and easy to grasp.
98972,"The class was clearly streamlined and practiced; it was great to have access to past exams exactly like those that would be given to us. However, it would have been nice to have more opportunities to check your knowledge than the four exams (e.g weekly homework) and a more rigorous system for outside lecture help (namely making sections mandatory- there were several times where my section was canceled because no one showed up)."
98972,"Strengths: I actually appreciated the 4 exam structure, not sure if that's a popular opinion. I appreciated that Breaker taught the entire class, that he didn't go through the material too quickly, that there was no homework or quizzes, the review sessions. the first part of the course (not metabolism) was well structured and the first exam especially was very fair. no cumulative final is a HUGE strength  Weaknesses: with the practice exams being the only material given to prepare us for the exams, there should have been an answer key given out to guide our review. I think exam study guides would have been helpful.  I honestly don't think this class facilitated student learning, but maybe that's an unfair assessment. you would study so much for each exam, and there was so much material, that you would end up forgetting almost everything immediately after the next exam.   the course was very memorization heavy. breaker says that you don't need to memorize material, but that's not true. you will not do well in this class if you don't memorize literally everything he says in class. the second part of the course (metabolism) could have been better taught  the slides were very busy, not very conducive to learning.   before the last exam, we didn't get through all the material, and he said we would have to learn it on our own. thankfully it wasn't tested, but it was unfair that he expected us to learn the material on our own as if it were our own fault that we didn't get to it.  hard to know what was going to be on the exam versus what was not going to be on the exam. the second half of the course was so detailed and you were told you wouldn't have to memorize specific mechanisms, but then you were."
98972,Great class
98972,No recorded lectures for review/study. Lecturing is slow. No study materials (old exams but no practice. No answer key to review either).
98972,"This course is well set up. The content on the lecture slides is what ends up on the midterms, no arbitrary content from the textbook. It is always very clear what you need to know for the exams."
98972,"The class was taught so well. I thought there should be more of a chance to improve your score, as the first exam early in the semester already counts as a fourth of the grade. (Like dropping one test)"
98972,"Strengths: non cumulative exams, Breaker is good at explaining the material, review sessions before each exam, felt like I actually learned a lot, low workload besides exams   Weaknesses: No recordings for a 9 am lecture- even if I didnt miss a class, Breaker talks so fast and adds so much information to the slides. It was often difficult to write everything down and catch all the information that typically ended up on the exams. I thought it was silly that Breaker keeps the recordings. It would be extremely helpful if we could go back and rewatch the lectures before the exams. Also, if you dont have a friend in the class to get the notes from, you have to go through the trouble of getting the recording from Breaker. Dont understand the logic of keeping the recordings from everyone.  The exams were fair in the sense that the material could be found on the slides, but it was always SOOO much material to study and remember at once. I always felt overwhelmed for each exam and felt like the material was excessively dense."
98972,"Strengths: Professor Breaker was great. He was engaging, thorough, and I felt as though I gained a lot from his instruction.  Weaknesses: The constant exams were a bit stressful but manageable. Grading took a long time to get back. Also, we had to teach ourselves half of a powerpoint for the final."
98972,I liked the independent aspect of the course. Sometimes it can be overwhelming though.
98972,strength: I liked just having exams   weakness: inconsistent pacing
98972,"It is based only on four exams and not all of the content gets covered in lecture. While all of the test material is from lecture slides, it is not all from in-person lecture content. Some questions came from future lectures which I had not looked at. While it was clear what main ideas and content we were to grasp from the first few lectures, the last lectures were packed with many slides and mechanisms which made it hard to know what main concepts were being taught. Given that there were many mechanisms involved in the lectures after glycolysis, it was unclear what parts we had to study for exams so it was a bit difficult to know how to study for the last two exams."
98972,Professor Breaker is a great lecturer!
98972,Theres just a lot of content. I think the course desperately needs to add more grades. I also think answer keys are important for fairness with grading. Theres also no help for studying/guide o how to do it. I also thought I was weird that sections took so long to finalize because schedules were already set by then and I couldnt make any of the available times.
98972,Weaknesses - lots of co tent to learn and lack of consistency with tests
98972,"Maybe its just me, but I liked having no problem sets. It forced me to sit with the content for longer as opposed to just learning enough to complete the pset. Prof Breaker is very approachable and the TFs were great too! The one thing I didnt appreciate was how we kept learning new content two days before an exam (though that might have been because we got behind at the beginning of the semester)."
98972,"I enjoy how the course is mostly exam based because it forces me to try and understand/learn the material in class and through outside studying without the pressure of weekly homeworks. However, I would love to have more practice problems available for when test time comes, so that I am able to do practice questions that I would have seen on a pset."
98972,"STRENGTHS: you learn a lot without too much stress - Professor Breaker is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate, and the exams are fair. You get a good base understanding of biochemistry and patterns without putting in an overwhelming amount of intellectual and emotional labor. Breaker is encouraging and it is clear that he cares about student learning. WEAKNESSES: I would have loved more clarity on expectations for knowledge of mechanisms and processes for the third and fourth exams. It was unclear in how much depth you should know a process - it was unclear when you had to know names, specific mechanisms, numbers of molecules produced and when a general conceptual understanding was good enough preparation for the exam."
98972,I really like how the class consists of just four exams and none are cumulative. I do think they should have required sections or perhaps other opportunities to engage with the material such as optional journal clubs with Professor Breaker.
98972,"Strengths: Professor Breaker!!! What an incredible human being. Also, Seth Lyon, the head TF. Oftentimes, what makes STEM courses accessible for me is the community and care I feel in that space, and I can tell that they both (and all of the TFs that I only met with briefly!) really care about biochemistry and how to teach it well. Incredibly taught STEM course. I feel very grateful for the teaching. Communication was great. The timing of the exams was also great. 4 exams that were not cumulative (for the most part) helped me integrate the knowledge I learned throughout the semester. The course was accessible to all students, with Zoom options and lecture recordings readily available. Weaknesses: I wish we had an EdDiscussion so I could know what questions other students were asking and what they needed help with. A centralized way to get questions answered would be a good idea, I think. It might even alleviate a bit of the stress from individual instructors (I know I sent Professor Breaker one too many questions over email, haha)."
98972,"The lectures were very clear, teaching style was great and you felt like you were learning a lot and understanding complex topics during lecture."
98972,"strengths: exams were fair, Seth was an amazing TA (very available and open to meet with students, answers all questions and emails very quickly), Professor Breaker was very excited about teaching the material, and made the material digestible and understable weaknesses: recordings were not made available so it was difficult to review material that was covered too quickly, or was difficult to understand"
98972,Good class with good lecture style. Professor Breaker really made this class engaging and incredible and was a large strength for the class. No big weaknesses
98972,"The connectivity of information that we learned was kind of limited. Additionally, I wish there were different things that could have contributed to a final grade besides the 4 exams."
98972,Strengths: Prof. Breaker is realy knowledgeable and his study sessions and office hours are incredibly helpful for the exam   Weaknesses: The 4 exams constituting the whole grade can be a little stressful. I think having access to the recordings would help ease some of the stress when studying.
98972,Workload is not that intensive but final grade is just made up of the four exams--maybe offering optional p-sets throughout the semester as a way to facilitate learning throughout the semester
98972,"Strengths: I thought Professor Breaker was a clear lecturer, and I appreciated how he often paused for questions and took time to delve deeply into the material. Exams were fair. Weaknesses: Difficult to estimate what exams would look like because we only got one practice test for each exam (some pointers as to what to focus on and how in depth to go would be great). Also would have appreciated if review sessions were scheduled further in advance instead of the day before."
98972,4 exams gets a lot of pressure
98972,"pacing of lectures was slow at times, and rushed over the harder to understand parts"
98972,A more moderate pace could help the course as well as possibly more detailed explanations on what concepts are more important than others as the content is very heavy.
98972,"I thought that a lot of the content was very interesting, and that there was good pacing for the material throughout the course. We were a bit rushed at the end, but that is a minor issue. Overall I thought it was a good course.  One weakness of the course is that it only has four exams. I think that courses in science-related subjects should provide grade opportunities such as homework or small reading exercises to supplement tests (personally, I think tests are not indicative of mastery of a subject at all, but rather reflect how well someone can memorize and repeat information). Homework allows students to work through their reasoning more steadily, and gives students time to think about the biology involved. Additionally, having many homework throughout the semester could help boost engagement as well, since students would actively have to participate and think about the topic, and not just rush through exam review one week before exams like I know most students did."
98972,"Strengths: engaging lectures Weaknesses: class content was not recorded/distributed, making it difficult to review content; lecture slides were often non-comprehensive and had mixed utility as a study resource; a lack of any problem sets or way to learn the material made it hard to conceptualize topics before the exams."
98972,"I think this course was taught very well and the slides were composed in a way that was very easy to understand. There was also a lot of support from the professor and TFs with office hours and review sessions. This course also did not have a lot of homework which was nice because it allowed for more time to be spent on studying for exams. In terms of weaknesses, it would have been nice to have some sort of regular assignments (even if they are very short) to test our knowledge each week and make sure we are practicing the material before exams."
98972,The course is great in terms of content and the professor makes it very easy to understand as long as you attend lecture. A weakness is that although we were not able to cover all the anticipated content.
98972,"The strengths included the TF supports and the thorough lectures that Professor Breaker delivered. The weakness however was that these lectures were not readily available as recordings and so when it came time for exams, it was hard to review content that was explicitly covered or talked about more by the professor than in the readings or lecture slides."
98972,Good course.
98972,"I think that the lectures themselves were engaging.   I do not like the 4 exam being our grade policy. I have test anxiety, and if it were not for my friends in the class, I would have suffered a bit more. I also found the lecture slides a bit overwhelming at times, and it was unclear about whether or not certain things would be covered in the exam."
98972,"I really enjoyed how the class was taught, and I, specifically, loved Breaker's lecturing style. You can tell he's super passionate about the topic, and his main goal is to ensure that the class understands the biochemical processes he's explaining. I didn't love that there was never an answer key posted to the practice exams, but I had a great TA that would go over all the practice exams with us during the section before the exam. Personally, I actually loved the class and looked forward to attending lecture."
98988,"I think that this course is really good for non-science majors who are wanting to learn more about biology without taking the intro bio sequence. It was a challenging course conceptually for me since I hadn't taken a bio course since my freshman year of high school, but I think that it was a very good and important course for me to take."
98988,it would be a lot easier if section time was spent reviewing the lecture (bio) material instead of doing unrelated readings and spending section time discussing those
98988,"I think this course would be much better if it covered a much smaller range of topics and went much more in depth instead. In every unit, I felt like I had only the vaguest, most surface-level understanding of the content. A lot of the time, I was just memorizing phrases without knowing what they meant. This class says it has no prerequisite but it felt like it was geared towards people who had some kind of background in biology."
98988,"Kind of difficult for non-stem students to engage with. Course content gets really technical most of the time, and goes in detail in a way that I think is very intimidating and difficult to track for the average student. Memorization gets tough because of how in depth you need to know material. Course wasn't all bad, but at its core not approachable."
98988,"Strengths: discussion sections, TFs  Weaknesses: the material was really hard to me to grasp sometimes, and I felt like lectures could be more engaging or clearer. Readings sometimes felt unnecessary and there was barely any discussion of the social or political role of epidemics like HIV."
98988,"Strengths: Interesting readings that tackled immunity and contagion from both biological and social lenses. The field trips were really fun and engaging, especially the trip to the Medical School. The first half of the class was really balanced in terms of content and examinations/Psets.   Weaknesses: Lectures could be really dense at times. It would help especially in the second half of the course to break up the content more or have less content, especially in the tolerance/immune regulation lecture. I also felt that the level of difficulty on the Quiz and Presentation was much harder than that of the first half of the course (Psets and midterm). Having more details on the grading of the Presentation and what is expected would have made this part of the course even stronger."
98988,Strengths: You will be extremely knowledgeable about the immune system by the end of the semester. The final exam was open note and easy if you prepared well.  Weaknesses: NOT A GUT. Many humanities majors take this class expecting a gut. Professor Kavathas' slides are not arranged well and can be confusing when coupled with her rapid lecturing style. Section was the only thing pulling me through.
98988,"strengths: very holistic, cover a lot of bases weaknesses: advertised for non-STEM majors but this is inaccurate. goes very very into detail and if you don't have a good biology background, not a great course to take"
98988,Strengths: You can tell the professor really wants her students to learn and has implemented many support systems for that to occur. Weaknesses: Students should be warned that this course is not necessarily for humanities people; the scientific content is pretty intense.
98988,I think that the only comment I have for this class is that it's not a STEM class for humanities major. It's a very intense science course that goes into a lot of the detail and knowledge that you might want to know before the class. The content would be good if it was not advertise as a class for non-stem major.
98988,Great structure of lectures -- very organized Wish the lectures were just a tiny bit more simplified for non-science majors
98988,"Strengths: great material, the professor was really kind, and super passionate  Weaknesses: learning the material felt like drinking from a fire hose but overall felt manageable"
98988,"This course was great overall! I am not an MCDB major and I still felt like I was able to understand a lot.  I felt the booklet was often confusing and I gained much more from watching the lectures and rewatching them on canvas than I did from reading the booklet.  I felt the quiz was unnecessarily specific, and I while I went to all of the lectures and studied before the quiz I still felt like I couldn't answer many of the questions. Next year a study guide (similar to the midterm study guide) would be helpful for future students."
98988,"This course was highly disorganized and hard to follow, and the exams tested uber-specific information that did not feel relevant to the information that we learned in lecture. I thought this course would include more social science aspects of how diseases impact society, but lectures were very science-heavy while discussion sections were sociology-heavy--the two were never synthesized in exams except obscure questions on the midterm and final that didn't seem relevant at all. The quiz was extremely difficult and it felt like nothing I studied for appeared on the exam. Grading was very harsh and strict, if you don't follow her guidelines on the presentation exactly she will take points off (font size, # of slides, info included). Although Paula was very nice, this course felt not tailored to non-STEM students--the info we were learning felt extremely advanced and too in-depth at times. The lecture slides were extremely hard to follow and not well-built. The only good thing was that the final exam was open note--the final exam questions were so specific that if you didn't write the entire booklet down you would miss something. I felt very stressed about this class despite it being called a science gut--THIS IS NOT A GUT! Take at your own discretion"
98988,"Strengths: A lot of support from the TAs and professor and comprehensive and rich curriculum that allows you to view the immune system through a biological, social, and historical frameworks. Weakness: Sometimes the readings were a lot and we didn't really know what to expect from the final exam"
98988,"The course is excellent. The readings the professor assigns are mostly from a booklet she made, and they present the material in an informative and engaging way. There are two main goals to the class, to learn about the more sciencey side (the function of different parts of the immune system) and the public health side (think more humanities type readings about how pandemics developed and how they affected culture). Both are interesting, but some might find one side more engaging than another."
98988,"The material is very interesting in class and in readings. The discussion sections were very useful for going over material, since the lectures especially in the first half sometimes felt a bit rushed. There was a lot of material but it all fit together in a bigger picture which made it easier to learn."
98988,This course is taught very effectively and clearly and well organized.
98988,The course could be improved by having better organized slides and information and by choosing readings which directly supplement lecture content.
98988,"This course is not geared for non-stem majors as advertised. The lectures are far too quick and the feedback for assignments is sparse and not as helpful as it could be. Along with this, I feel that the grading was too harsh at times, especially when assignments were graded by the professor instead of the TFs."
98988,This course was extremely accessible to students who had difficulties with science in the past and accommodations were made by a wonderful professor and great TFs.
98988,"Strengths: I appreciated that the psets challenged me to think about and review the recent materials from lectures and found them helpful while I was reviewing for the midterm and the final. I also really appreciated the booklet, which took some pressure off noting down everything in lecture and provided helpful summaries of our discussions. The booklet was very helpful when I was completing psets and reviewing for the midterm and the final. I felt that the class was challenging but usually a manageable workload for a non-stem major taking it as my fifth class.   Weaknesses: I think a fourth pset would have been more helpful for reviewing than a quiz in the last week of the semester. Part of the reason I decided to take this class was because there was only a midterm, a final, and an essay. The essay was changed to a quiz halfway through the semester, and throughout the semester other assignments on the syllabus were shifted around. I would have appreciated more consistency in the syllabus so I knew what to expect while taking the class at the beginning of the semester. Though the booklet was very helpful, sometimes the wording and organization was confusing. I would have appreciated it if some of the complicated biological processes were spelled out from beginning to end in a step-by-step format. Sometimes acronyms were used without including what they stood for or what they meant, which was confusing. I could usually resolve my questions by googling but for a class that asks a lot of students who were mostly not science majors, this felt like extra effort that would have been better placed trying to understand the concepts rather than trying to puzzle through confusing wording."
98988,"Strengths: does not dumb down material, even though many non-STEM majors take the class; sections help us digest material; grading and assignment expectations are fair yet understanding, considering many students have never taken and will never again take an MCDB course.  Weaknesses: the slides sometimes seemed like they could've been reordered to go in order/explain a new concept step by step and thus facilitate better learning."
98988,Stengths: the discussion sections helped me learn the topics more and I enjoyed the readings Weakness: The lectures were very boring and there are not many opportunities to review what you are learning in class and actually applying them
98997,I think the quiz evaluation system was great and helped me learn without being impossible and the lectures were all very interesting! I will say that discussion section was relatively unhelpful in terms of preparing for the quiz and stuff.
98997,"This class is great! The lectures were super clear, and the expectations for quizzes and the final were well communicated. The content is super interesting, and the open-note/study guide format allowed me to engage with the material without having to drown in memorization."
98997,-would like to see a little more engagement like small homeworks. Was very hard to keep everything including small details that werent in the review or packet in my head especially by the finals
98997,It's actually so much less stressful to have to take a quiz every week and have the studying spread out throughout the semester instead of having many psets and most of the grade concentrated in a few exams. I really enjoyed the organization of this class :) It was also very helpful to have the recordings of lectures posted for the final.
98997,I liked how the course was open note for exams which emphasized understanding of the material rather than simply memorizing names of proteins.
98997,"strengths:  - lectures were interesting (although sometimes a bit overwhelming)  - lecture handouts and slides were well constructed and helpful   weaknesses:  - sometimes I felt like I was being bombarded with so much information that it was really hard to keep track of the big picture. Especially for the signal transduction pathways, I feel like it might have been helpful to go over fewer pathways and emphasize the general principles instead of going over the intricacies of so many pathways.  - on a similar note, sometimes this class felt relentless in a way that impeded my information processing. For example, diving into lecture right after an intense quiz with no break prevented me from taking the necessary few minutes to decompress and relax my brain and prepare to receive more information. If possible, I think implementing a short five-minute break after the quizzes would improve the flow of this class and would actually serve to improve student retention and understanding."
98997,"The course is highly organized, and so you do feel like you have more than enough time to prepare in advance for all of the quizzes and material that might be assessed each week. However, because of this it did become easy to immediately forget everything the week after it was tested."
98997,"Strengths: Being able to use our notes/packets on the quizzes and exams is a life-saver, especially with so many details packed into each lecture, and doing the review questions during discussion section helped to solidify the key parts of each chapter. Weaknesses were the lecture slides, which sometimes seemed quite long and not as engaging compared to lectures with interactive questions or group thinking Qs posed."
98997,"I really love that this course is quiz based. As a student with horrible testing anxiety, having a weekly quiz of relatively low stakes was much more manageable for me than quarterly exams. It forced me to keep up with the content and ensured I didn't fall behind, but also made me feel reassured about making mistakes because I had so many chances with other quizzes. I wish more courses used this format instead of exams.  I do wish that the quizzes were based on the previous week's Tuesday and Thursday lectures rather than the Thursday from two weeks prior and then the previous Tuesday. It made it hard to keep track of which lectures were being quizzes and also forced the students to backtrack quite a bit to study.   This course takes on a massive amount of information. There were very few lectures where we actually finished everything the professor had intended and this often put us a lecture or two behind schedule so that they could catch back up. It's just so much content. Most of it is interesting but it's hard to keep up at times."
98997,"I appreciate how all the teaching staff seem to really have students' best interests at heart. I think the course itself is well-structured and I appreciated how learning was emphasized over grades. I feel like a lot of MCDB courses are really one-dimensional, given that professors generally just tend to test on memorization ability, and I think this class is unique from other MCDB courses, in actually explaining and rationalizing the knowledge presented."
98997,"Overall, I enjoyed the course and feel like I learned alot. The weekly sections were worth going to and really helped cement the material for me."
98997,"On the whole, the lectures were decently engaging, and the material was interesting.   It felt like some lectures were very rushed, and it would require a lot of processing of information outside of class. It would also often be difficult to make it to professor office hours."
98997,A LOT of content to be honest but very interesting content and lecturers were great!
98997,"Sometimes the lectures were too long and the quizzed material didnt line up with lectures, which was confusing. Everything else was ideal"
98997,Strength: weekly quizzes kept me engaged and up to speed. Weakness: some lectures may have benefitted from engagement activities (thinking questions to discuss with peers). This would have helped ease the dryness.
98997,"Strengths: good course structure, interesting lectures, weekly quizzes that encourage you to review material as you go along in the semester   Weaknesses: some of the lectures are really rushed might be better to reduce quantity of content and focus on quality of lectures and material being delivered"
98997,I liked the design of this course with the weekly quizzes. I felt like this model required students to keep up with the material and think about it critically. I also enjoyed how this course had three different professors that lectured on topics that they are experts in. I think that discussion sections could be better spent going over particularly difficult concepts in the lectures rather than the sample questions at the end of the review packets.
98997,"The class was interesting, although sometimes it was difficult to keep up with lectures. The quizzes weren't terribly difficult, but it was certainly pretty tough to keep up during the more intense parts of the semester; the three drops came in very clutch. I do wish there were more of the little discussion bits where we talked about experimental results during lectures since these helped break up the long streams of lecturing, but I do understand there was a monstrous amount of content to cover in a rather limited timeframe."
98997,"Strengths: Weekly quizzes were sometimes torture to study for every week but were deeply essential in learning and retaining the fire-hose of information that was taught. The course was also well-organized and incredibly well-taught. I loved that the emphasis was on synthesizing and understanding information rather than memorizing.  Weaknesses: Having a separate packet for each lecture would be great (instead of stapling and combining multiple together), and more clarity over which concepts to focus on for quizzes would be great."
98997,"- Weekly quizzes were great for consolidating information! Also, the class is definitely set up for you to succeed as much as possible - its clear the professors want you to succeed! The teaching team is fantastic. The final exam is slightly overbearing though."
98997,The strengths of this class is that it is a really good introduction to biology and that the materials provided are very detailed. The weaknesses is that there is so much material and sometimes youre not sure what is really important to study.
98997,"Strengths: course/lecture organization... the topics discussed in class followed a very logical progression that helped in connecting topics from the beginning to the end of the semester. Also, the regular review questions were helpful in gauging material comprehension after every lecture. Weaknesses: students' grades are entirely dependent on performance on the quizzes and the final exam. I think that participation points for attending the weekly discussion sections would be well-received."
99001,"Strengths: Course material is extremely interesting, you learn a LOT, and weekly quizzes are very manageable. The professors are very knowledgeable about the subject, and are always receptive to clarifying questions. Lectures are also recorded, which really helps with studying. Weaknesses: The material is very complicated, and often slides do not have enough information (most of fit is transmitted orally). Additionally, the class grading system is 25% for each of the three exams, and then 25% for the quizzes, so there is not a lot of room for error - if you do well with exams it is fine, but just something to keep in mind."
99001,The lecture slides not being posted to canvas before the lecture made it very hard for me to absorb the information during lecture since I was too busy writing down the information on the slides. I think that by releasing them before it makes it easier to learn.
99001,"It gives a very detailed introduction to developmental biology, which sometimes is a lot too detailed and specific regarding only 1 cell type."
99001,It was very well laid out
99001,"Strengths: The material is very interesting and the lectures are engaging. I like the weekly quizzes as it encourages you to review and engage with the material as you go along and not just before the exam. The exams are also very manageable and non-cumulative which is nice because there is a lot of material being covered.   Weaknesses: I wish there would've been some sort of formal weekly discussion section where we had a chance outside of lecture to go through the important concepts again and ask questions, as well as read more about the current research going on in the field."
99001,The quizzes are too much of a hit or miss and sometimes cover very obscure topics. The class averages have been 70s and the class is generally not curved.
99001,"The course covers a lot of information in a relatively short amount of time between various exams. The two professors are strict and refused makeups of quizzes or excused absences even with a Dean's extension or excuse. It felt like they were unwilling to work with the students in the class. Some notes or powerpoints were inaccessible due to the usage of an outdated website, which made the fast pace of lecture feel even worse."
99002,a relatively easy course but quite messy and disorganized
99002,"Strengths: straightforward lectures, interesting professors, great teaching team  Weaknesses: can be hard to study for tests that seem very memorization based"
99002,"Most of the weaknesses of the course comes from the format with all of the visiting professors. Strengths -- Nice to have each lecturer present on something they are so familiar with and passionate about, especially when MDs present on research that overlaps with their clinical work. Even without real central organization, communication from Prof Guller and TFs was clear. Teaching fellows and review sections were fantastic. Assessments and grading was fair, and open note exams was definitely the best way to test understanding.  Weaknesses -- Made it difficult to have continuity between lectures and in each class we had to adjust to a slightly different teaching style. This was especially hard with the format of slides -- some were heavily image-based or schematics that then had no good way to review or ask follow-up questions in class. This was a bit frustrating but conducive to a 3x per week 50-min lecture schedule."
99002,I love that it is taught by all guest lecturers!
99002,This course is not structured well at all. The exams are a terrible evaluation of what you have learned. You have like 800 different professors and lectures so none of the content is taught in a connectable way and they give you no time on the exams to even think.
99002,"The open note exams were really nice and took a lot of the emphasis away from knowing everything by heart, but still ensuring that we have a good understanding of the material."
99002,"This course was very disorganized. The order of lectures did not make logical sense and were not fit for learning. The lecture styles were also vastly different, and some professors would repeat the same content whereas others would assume we had background information that we did not have. I would have appreciated it if the lectures were more standard and if there were fewer lecturers to make learning more digestible. Additionally, we had multiple issues with the exams this year, resulting in a somewhat unfair grading of the first exam and the last exam being much more difficult (in terms of number of questions asked and difficulty of questions) compared to previous exams. I felt unprepared for these changes and although the TAs did their best to support us, these administrative barriers made this class difficult to engage with."
99002,"The only weakness is that it is very difficult to get any read of what will be on the exams or what the questions will look like as there are not practice exams or homeworks and each day is a different professor, so you only get to know what the exam will look like after the first exam which is 33% of your final grade."
99002,Strengths: Open note exams that are not that hard if you just take really good notes. Allows you to spend more time understand the material rather than just trying to memorize everything. Frequent change of topics made the course still interesting even if one specific area isn't particularly of interest. Lots of professors that were open to talking about OBGYN.  Weaknesses: The fact that almost each lecture was a different professor meant that building a connection with any single one seemed harder. This also made the material sometimes feel disconnected and all over the place.
99002,The open-note exams were difficult even though they were open-note. I am not sure how reflective the actual class is by your exam grade.
99002,"Strengths: interesting content, expert lecturers/very passionate about their work and their field Weaknesses: having different lecture styles is a bit difficult to follow, and the order of the lectures this year was not at all intuitive in the beginning (for ex we started off on a topic that required a lot of basic knowledge/terms but we didn't get to the lecture teaching those basic concepts and terms until later on)"
99002,"There was some inconsistencies in lectures because each lecture is given by a different person. Strengths were the TA's and review sessions, as well as the open-note format for exams."
99002,"Weaknesses: Exams were more about time than knowledge. I don't think they tested our knowledge of the material. The exams were also on Canvas, and this led to many technical difficulties. Definitely not a gut or easy A."
99002,The exam format is very frustrating. Exams had technical problems during two of the three exams and there were so many questions (more than 1 per minute) that a good score on an exam often came down more to time management than material knowledge or preperation.
99002,"The class structure, specifically the lectures, can sometimes be overwhelming and difficult to grasp. The class was only 50 minutes long, but we had lectures with over 150 slides. Thankfully, the TAs could break down the content, but some more organization on behalf of the professors would help in how we should approach the material."
99002,"I enjoyed the course material, but I wish the course encouraged a higher level of engagement."
99002,"Strengths: diverse array of lecture topics, opportunity to learn from folks doing some phenomenal work in the reproductive sciences, super supportive team of TAs (especially Derek!) Weakness: order of lectures did not feel intuitive at several points"
99002,"I really enjoyed learning the content from different instructors. Each instructor specialized in the content they presented, which was very cool. It was also really helpful that the teaching team was pretty flexible with the lecture recordings when the students presented a good reasoning to obtain them."
99002,The strength of the class is that each lecturer is a specialist in their respective field. The largest weakness of the class is the poor organization. The course is primarily run by the TAs as there isn't a main professor who is at lectures. The sections could be improved and the tests are mostly based on if you can take word-for-word notes on what is said during lecture.
99002,Strength is that we get to engage with multiple different professors that are all experts in their field.
99002,"I wish the slides from the guest lecturers were more updated on the day of the actual lecture. There were some times when the lecture covered material that was NOT on the slides and this was just too distracting; I could not follow along at all, causing me to miss a lot of material at times."
99002,"More practice exams and work would be helpful to understand concepts. In addition to this, content teaching and style was very different depending on the professor so a more clear outline on what is important to remember would have helped. In addition, there were many technical problems that arised during exam periods which affected me negatively in terms of grades and ability to answer questions."
99002,"Strengths: broad overview of topics covered, with extreme specificity on certain topics while extremely broad understanding for others; Papers in discussion sections are very interesting; Derek is an amazing TA; Derek's review sessions and resources are extremely helpful Weakness: No lecture recordings, every lecture has a different professor -> professors have not evaluated whether certain topics have already been covered or not; course lacks cohesion"
99002,I really enjoyed the different lecturers and the unique insight they brought into every lecture!
99002,"Strengths: rotating professors, since during lectures you can really get into each topic Weaknesses: a bit difficult to study for these exams because of the difference of professors."
99002,"I like that we had so many different lecturers in this course, but I really wish the instructors had been more accessible for asking questions. It was basically impossible to get help."
99007,Very very tough exam questions. Really ruined my course experience.
99007,did not like having graded in-class exercises; some students have different learning styles and learn better through self-study outside of lecture
99007,"Strengths: good slides  Weaknesses: awful grading structure. Students receive no clarity even at the end of the semester where the median or average of the class falls. Quite concerning when the raw average is a C. Professors are inconsiderate regarding this. I would prefer there be some consistent standard coming into the course. Also, no hybrid office hours. Other MCDB courses employ this and made it much more accessible."
99007,only 3 midterms to determine your grade can make this course a little stressful. You do learn a lot though.
99007,"Strengths: very interesting lecture content, both of the professors are great, engaging lecturers, no homework assignments, didn't assume that much prior biology knowledge; Weaknesses: questions on exams were very specific to the lecture slide details, mild disconnect between first and second half of the course"
99007,"Strengths: The instructors, especially Prof. Hatzios, are great. Weaknesses: the class only has 3 exams so your grade is based on what you get on those exams. The exams are very hard but there are great peer tutors and TFs that are willing to answer your questions."
99007,"UGh everything was a strength as each professor actually cares about one's personal growth and explains as best as they can in the allotted time. they definitely do not go super fast just to get through content. Also, the grading could be less rigid since this is a concept-driven course. Please change that"
99007,The course was really good at explaining concepts especially in the second half and really facilitated student learning. I also really liked that you could ask questions during lecture despite being such a big class! Inalso really liked the in class exercises that made me think about the concepts taught in class in a very engaging way.
99007,"Liked the pacing of the course but the exams sucked. The TAs host a weekly review session but only for you to ask questions, nobody went. Needs better method of supporting students since this is one of only ways students interact with the TAs. Liked the in-class participation assignments though."
99007,The course was structured very well and was well paced. The professor were very communicative and the teaching team was very accessible
99007,"strengths: knowledgeable TAs, both professors Yan and Hatsioz were also very knowledgeable and excited to teach."
99007,"strengths: the course is structured so that we learn the molecular content in the beginning and more applications in the second half which makes the content organized and more approachable, there are many resources for help such as office hours, review sessions, and peer tutors  weaknesses: the grade is only composed of three midterms and 10% in-class excersizes, although the in-class exercises can help your grade, almost everyone in the class will get 100%, making it not change much for the curve, with only three midterms, there is not a lot of work throughout the semester, however, more work could be helpful to test our understanding of the content at the level that is expected, also, given the nature of the course, it can be hard to predict your grade (not much can be changed but it is something to be aware of)"
99007,poor course. 3 heavily weighted midterms that rely on buzzwords and finicky information rather than understanding of material
99007,Strength: Lectures are great and the TFs are very helpful. The feedback was quite clear. Weaknesses: Too many exams and lack of other means of assessment (discussion sections where some papers are introduced might be very great)-- this might cause a very big workload during exam period.
99007,I think the teaching and the content are both strengths of this course. Every lecture was very interesting and the slides were quite informative. I also thought that both professors were very fair with their exam questions and the content they expected us to learn.
99007,"Strengths: The workload was relatively low, considering you only had to study for the exams. As along as you reviewed early on enough, the exams were not that bad.  Weaknesses: None, I liked the structure of the class"
99007,"I thought this was an excellent course overall. My one comment is that the powerpoint lectures were very bulky at times, and as someone who prefers hand-written notes, they often too fast paced for me to keep up with note taking. Perhaps having more hand written notes in the future, or lecturing at a slightly slower pace would be helpful. Another comment is that I am not fond of classes where exams are the central point, and this class graded us primarily on three exams spread throughout the semester. Small in-lecture questions graded for completion are alright, but I think that having actual homework problems that challenge us to think more constructively about biological questions would be much more useful for student learning, since doing few problems a week on our own time would greatly bolster how well we know the material. This would also help make sure that the course is not purely based on memorization and repeating information on exam dates."
99007,"The course is very well-organized and taught. Professors Hatzios and Yan clearly care a lot about student success and offer a lot of resources. I found the lectures engaging and interesting, and the applications to medicine and the outside world really impactful."
99007,The course could benefit from more assignments and also more practice questions. Review sessions were always after exams which did not make a lot of sense to me. Even if they werent assignments I wish there were more checkpoints to check understanding from lectures.
99007,"strengths: very low workload unless you're studying for the midterms. professors are incredibly knowledgeable. Hatzios is especially amazing. And, most importantly, SUPER interesting topic. weaknesses: exams are so, so hard. It is really rough that your entire grade (90%) is based on these exams."
99012,I loved that this course did separate blocks for different organ systems.
99012,"Its an amazing course, but it is incredibly dense. The lectures feel like the professor is just constantly throwing information at you and you kind of just have to absorb it all. Its really interesting stuff, but it does take a LOT of effort to learn it all, especially since this class only has 5 tests that comprise your whole grade."
99012,Strengths: broad survey and team taught. Quite interesting material overall!  Weaknesses: lack of consistency throughout exams. Kidney lectures were quite dry and structured poorly. Did not receive exams.
99012,"I deeply appreciated how this course was organized. The 5-block system let us explore a variety of topics without sacrificing depth. The exam structure (1 exam every 4 lectures; curved; non-cumulative) made the high content load manageable and allowed students to focus on each block without worrying about studying all of the other blocks simultaneously. The content itself was fascinating, and the teaching team was excellent.  The only change I would make is to simplify the renal disease block. The corresponding exam was easily the most difficult, and many students (myself included) found it difficult to differentiate between all the forms of disease presented. In future years, it would be helpful to simplify the module and present fewer, more distinct diseases."
99012,"Strengths: excellent professors, fair exams, interesting and clinically-relevant content compared to most MCDB courses Weaknesses: never received exams back, some units were better organized than others, somewhat memorization based"
99012,"Strengths: interesting material and well-organized class with engaging professors. Weaknesses: exam preparation is solely dependent on slides and TFs, exam content/degree of detail expected is not always made clear."
99012,"The course covered the most important systems of the body and was very clear in teaching objectives and the instructors were all experts in their fields. However, the wide breadth of the course came at the cost of depth which was acknowledged and we did not get into any developmental pathologies."
99012,"The class was well organized but because each professor brought his or her own lecture format, there was variance in how well the lecture notes prepared for exams."
99012,"A lot of the material was memorization, and in some units with functionally more challenging pathology, the lecturing was not super helpful to learning the material. The way each unit began with structure and functional overview of the system was super helpful, and the disease reviews and treatment courses, with public health impacts at the end was a comprehensive and interesting way to learn."
99012,This was my favorite course this semester! I particularly enjoyed working on the last exam which was a case study. I think adding more of these assignments (can also be done in groups) would be really useful and helps engage the students more.
99012,"Strengths: all the content was incredibly engaging and had clear examples, the TAs were also fantastic, opportunity to see an autopsy and tumor board were also unique and very insightful, the order of the blocks were also fantastic and made logical sense Weaknesses: some of the lectures would go very into depth in anatomy or physiology whereas others don't, so it was a bit difficult to keep up with at times but not a major weakness"
99012,"All the content was enjoyable, and tests were very fair. However, due to the nature of switching professors after every block, the teaching style wasn't very consistent."
99012,"The modules of the course were very interesting and well-structured. It was nice to focus on one topic for a few weeks and be able to dive into it. The exams, however, were pretty detailed and required a lot of memorization to do well"
99012,"Overall, this is a good course for students interested in medicine or pathology."
99012,"Strengths: Block exams, as there was less content to know for each exam. Opportunities outside class, such as autopsies and tumor boards, which put the class content in context; the last exam was great because it forced us to look into the literature and rely on the principles we learned. Weaknesses: Sometimes, the lectures did not go into that much depth (particularly near the beginning), which led to vague questions on the exam that were difficult to answer in the way they wanted."
99012,This course was my favorite STEM course at Yale. It incorporated very interesting course material with engaging lectures. One challenge was the continuous rotation of professors. Each exam was very different depending on the professor that block so it made it very difficult to know how to study and what information to focus on. We also did not receive any guidance on grading which made it hard to know where you stood.
99012,"Some professors were very quiet, only read from their notes, never answered questions well and also made lecture recordings furiating to watch by walking away from the mic  Also I hate having to be constrained to two sentences answers. For the second exam, we were told that we were writing too much, but we could NEVER GET THE TESTS BACK TO ACTUALLY SEE WHERE WE IMPROVED. Forgive my outburst, but this was extremely frustrating to knownthat we were being told that we were doing something wrong, buy never was able to actually see what we did wrong."
99015,"This class is very poorly organized. There is little information provided on grading, timelines, or expectations for assignments."
99015,"Strengths: The first half of the course, excluding some unusual guest lectures, was generally well organized and taught across the gamut of traditional therapeutic strategies. I really enjoyed the lecture on biologics. The material from the second half of the course was super interesting--I feel that I now have an up-to-date scientific understanding of treatments for AD and DMD. The structure of the course with two quizzes, two midterms, and participation also felt fair. The quizzes were not particularly difficult.  Weaknesses: The organization of some of the lectures was quite poor. Although the learning objectives were supposed to guide us in studying, one lecture had twelve learning objectives (none of which were covered on the final). Some professors rushed through their teaching, making it really difficult to process the molecular pathways studied. Moreover, the writing of the final was unusual. We had ten lectures for the final. There was only one question (of seven on the final) on the first four lectures we had learned. The questions also tended to be remarkably broad or to ask for hyper-specific details of binding. Because of the disorganization of the second half of the course, I have a hard time recommending it.   There are also several throwaway lectures of the course. While I appreciated having individuals in the field of biotechnology come in, sometimes their presentations were too general to be meaningful. Stressing the importance of leadership in defining what is important to succeed in the C-suite of biotech, for instance, has little meaning without anecdotes or examples.   The course also is not transparent in whether the class will be curved. It would be helpful to know some benchmark of where you stand."
99015,"Due to the course being taught by different instructors, the types of questions seen on the first exam will be slightly different from the second. If the second half remains the same in the future, expect more specific questions to be asked. Overall though, the information presented was very interesting."
99015,"A pretty novel course topic and the lecturers were great experts on their given topic, maybe a bit more of a structure/insight into exams and grading could help"
99015,"Detailed and organized development of content and course progression.  Stong network of support and clear rules, instructions, and communication."
99015,I liked how we got to hear from different lecturers who each specialized in a given field. This made the class more engaging.
99015,All of the professors had very unique and engaging topics. My one criticism is I wish the discussion section assignments were posted earlier.
99015,I would have liked to see more clinical examples of biotechnology (only two presented were DMD and AD) but course was great nonetheless.
99015,"This was such an interesting class, and I really enjoyed the way it was taught with the papers in discussion section that matched the course materials each week. The concepts on the exam were fairly easy but the grading was difficult and for the amount of effort put into the discussion section assignments, it was frustrating that they didnt count for more of our grade."
99015,This is a very good MCDB course. I love the rotation of professors and think their different teaching styles complement each other well.
99015,"I liked that it covered a wide range of subjects (drug development, plant biology, genetic engineering, climate change)."
99015,"One of the strengths of this course is that it has different professors that teach who are expects in the field. It is also very organized.  However, the room where the class was located was not ideal as it was typically too hot or too cold, in addition the vents were too loud such that it was difficult to hear the instructors."
99015,"Strengths: the concepts and structure of work Weaknesses: I feel like the different speakers made the quality of teachings really vary, and sometimes, it was hard to adjust."
99015,"I think a strength was the topics that were discussed were really interesting. I also liked that there were multiple lecturers throughout the course. It gave the class an interesting take. However, i kind of wish that we had fewer lecturers so then we could have gotten to know them better. They were only there for 2 weeks at a time, and I think it could have given the presenters more time to delve into interesting topics. I also think that there was a lack of feedback that would have been nice."
99015,"I think it is a great course to have an overview of the state of biotechnology nowadays. It would be interesting to expand the section in which entrepreneurship is discussed. For example, it would be nice to have scientific founders explain what is the intentional thinking process behind developing a project that could become a venture."
99015,"detailed and very organized class lectures, well-planned weekly section discussions"
99015,"Strengths: the diverse range of topics covered throughout the semester made this course very engaging. Also, the learning objectives listed at the beginning of each lecture made it easier to process the information presented. Weaknesses: professors were difficult to get ahold of by email, no clear guidance on studying for assessments."
99015,good stuff
99039,"Homework was very reflective of the material, the lectures were useful and informative, and the exams were reasonable given the content learned."
99039,"Strengths: Exams are very fair, and lectures are very straightforward. The ULAs provide a lot of support when working on the homework.  Weaknesses: Lectures sometimes a bit boring."
99039,"Strengths: The professor is kind and generous with grading and scheduling. The flow of the curriculum is very logical and coherent. Weaknesses: The professor's lectures were interrupted by frequent arithmetic errors and long pauses where both students and professor were confused about questions fairly central to the course. However, this was the professor's first time teaching here, and I am optimistic that these weaknesses will be less prominent if he teaches this course in the future. Plus, in a way, these hiccups were a consequence of the professor being very open to fielding questions from students throughout the class, which was a huge strength."
99039,"The course had an awesome professor, Dr. Orelup. He made it so that the lectures were both interesting and understandable. I loved the focus place on practice problems during class. I have never had another class which did this, but it prepares you well for the problem sets and exams. There was also ample extra credit to help you achieve the best grade possible. The grading was also nice at the end, allowing you to really do the best you possibly can."
99039,The class was hard to follow and the psets were often on material not covered or way harder than what was taught in lecture. Exams were fairly easy which was nice. I also appreciated the final being optional. Would be nice to have lectures recorded
99039,"The ULAs were very helpful. Lecture was difficult to follow for me. I think it would be helpful if after every problem, we did a recap of the steps in the problem. Sometimes we did this, and I found that helpful."
99039,The lectures could have been more engaging. The material covered was good and was taught in a good manor. The notes were always posted and the office hours held were helpful at developing core course concepts.
99039,"The vast majority of class time was spent on example problems. This could be appropriate for a dynamics class, but Professor Orelup would often try to do these example problems without any notes/preparation and then make errors along the way. This class would be better if a bit more time were spent on theory, and the example problems covered were well-prepared and improved student understanding."
99039,This class does a good job of providing the students with time to learn the material as each class isn't packed to the brim (until the end).
99039,"This was my favorite MENG lecture course ever. The class was so much more organized than other lecture classes, and the slides were so helpful!   Strengths:  - slides were easy to read, concise but explain everything (newtdog & wormy also make the material so much easier to process) - most of class was spent on examples, and we actually went through all the steps to solve them rather than waving our hands and saying ""you can solve for this"" but not actually showing how to solve it (I think examples are super helpful and all lecture classes should spend more time on them rather than telling us to do problems on our own time. This way you learn how to get past the things that you get stuck on, and you can also learn to avoid mistakes that other people make.) - Professor was also very organized and easy to talk to, he explained things well without skipping any steps - solutions to class examples were posted online - solutions to homeworks were posted regularly - practice problems and solutions for exams were usually uploaded with enough time for students to prepare - extra credit provide incentive to learn even when you are struggling or falling behind (having hope that you can actually improve your grade by putting in more work is huge and this helps a lot)  Weaknesses:  - it was really hard to get help for the final because most of the class didn't take it and the TAs were not very easy to reach  - office hours were often too crowded to get help, so it would have been very difficult to get help on homework if I didn't have friends I could ask for help - TAs sometimes didn't explain things clearly and assumed I understood things when sometimes I didn't - The slides for vibrations felt like too much material crammed into a few days. They were also messier and harder to follow - solutions and practice problems for vibrations were uploaded late or not at all"
99039,"This course is taught well in that during class, we go through a lot of example problems so we see how different types of problems are solved. One weakness of the course is that it has no hands-on component. While the course is inherently a theoretical matter, I think it would be beneficial to apply the concepts to some sort of project."
99077,This course really helped me learn musical skills through hands on work. It could be a little more structured/organized during class time and when we are doing sectionals or music should be learned by.
99077,Not sure how I was doing throughout the whole course.
99077,Very fun course
99077,I really enjoyed everything about this course.
99077,"Super chill, really fun to be in with friends"
99077,"Strengths: the course was very flexible, engaging, and the final presentation was very fun!  Weakness: no feedback throughout semester"
99077,Top tier class
99077,"This class is unlike any other. Grant is truly so knowledgeable about this time period in music and it is such a pleasure to hear him speak, sing, and play to this music. He is like the renaissance man of Yale music. The strength is definitely Grant's expertise, and the camaraderie developed in the class by performing together. It's such a supportive environment."
99077,This course is precisely what it as marketed as. It was an extremely fun experience that resembled a choir class.
99077,This course is amazing for any musician wishing to engage more! Approachable for any level of singer
99077,"This is a fantastic course! It is so much fun to perform in an early music ensemble with friends and classmates. I learned a lot about Renaissance music and the techniques necessary to perform it. The style of this music is so different from traditional classical music, so it was great to be exposed to it and understand its structure. Learning a Renaissance instrument is a fun yet challenging adventure, but the reward of performing at the Beinecke was incredible!"
99077,"No weaknesses, the strengths are that the teacher is amazing and that the class is structured in a way that lends itself to rehearsal and music making."
99077,Incredible class. One of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale
99077,"Group rehearsals were very productive. Breakout sections with voice parts were a bit difficult to manage without an appointed section leader, but were infrequent enough that it didn't pose a significant challenge."
99077,"Strengths: - Professor Herreid is a true expert on early music and an exceptional musician. He is also extremely charming and fun to work with. - Relatively high level of students. The class had members of the YSO, on-campus vocal groups, and graduate music school. - The opportunity to play in a large early music ensemble is very rare and I'm grateful that Yale provides it.  Weaknesses: - The theory component of the class was really interesting, but I wish the content was covered in more detail."
99077,"No weaknesses, it's a great class and very chill."
99077,Only strengths. Truly a cornerstone of my Yale music education
99122,Very well organized and very interesting subject matter
99122,"Maybe make major grades worth less of the class: make it more participation based or something by adding mandatory section and graded participation, like a STEM class."
99122,"strengths: This course was very well organized with slides constantly updated, knowing exactly what to expect in quizzes and exams, and very fair grading. I was never confused or caught off guard by anything. I appreciate Professor Baskin-Sommers' style of teaching and the constant and immediate support on edstem. I think this class had the most reliable and swift responses to edstem questions, which made edstem a tool that I wanted to use and felt was incredibly helpful. I think that is a testament to how organized this class was."
99122,The timing of assignments seemed overwhelming and fast-paced at times. Three essays felt excessive.
99122,Strength: very clear lectures and instructions on how to do well in the class  Weakness: three essays and two midterms can be a lot.
99122,"Strengths: Very well organized, clear communication, easy to access materials online. I appreciated that slides were posted beforehand and recordings were available. Assignments were fair. Online help through Ed discussion and email was awesome and helped a lot with reviewing and editing work for exams and written assignments. Prof is really really good at answering conceptual questions, both when initially presenting information in lecture and responding to questions on Ed.  Weaknesses: In general I don't like when professors assign their own work as readings, but in this case Prof pioneered this entire field of study and so her own writing and explanations of the content were superb."
99122,The professor. Her lectures were so engaging and fun. The weakness - too many essays? and the feedback to the essay was quite variable depending on which TA grades your essay.
99122,Strengths: clearly organized syllabus and lectures; opportunities for feedback; engaging lecture  Weaknesses: many assignments (some of which felt extraneous); lectures geared toward people who already had a fundamental understanding of neuroscience
99122,"Strengths: there are a lot of resources provided for students, the material is really interesting, the course is set up for students to do well, the assignments are really interesting and make you think, the guest lecturers were really interesting to hear from Weaknesses: I think the exams could be improved, I like that they were quick and relatively low stress but I think having more free response or short answer questions would be nice and would help us apply our knowledge a little more, there is very little flexibility in an exam that is all multiple choice and is only 25 questions"
99122,"Strengths: I think the course is extremely well organize, Professor is accessible and there are multiple avenues to ask for help / get feedback.   Weaknesses: Honestly, I struggled a lot with the wording on some quiz / exam questions."
99122,"Answered above - course needs to be more neutral and show a diverse perspectives from clinical and criminal psychology literature instead of Professor Baskin-Sommers and her favorite counterparts. However, exams and assignments are well designed to test knowledge and understanding of what was taught."
99122,Lectures were engaging and class content really interesting
99122,"Strengths: amazing readings, engaging lectures, very transparent grading and assignment process (so much TA support, many review sessions and office hours, Ed thread, opportunities for extra credit and points back, etc.) Weaknesses: none!! This class was fantastically organised."
99122,"No weaknesses  Strengths: Arielle is a FANTASTIC professor who will constantly keep you engaged, there was never a moment where I felt like I was not grasping the material. If you listen and go to lecture, youll be fine!"
99122,"i thought it was an extremely interesting course and learned so much from every lecture. i wish it was a bit less neurological and focused more on the psychological factors, but was interesting nonetheless"
99122,"Strength: the material was clearly organized and easy to follow; Dr. Baskin-Sommers' delivery is clear and concise; the slides are really informative and helpful for revision; the assignments were appropriate in enhancing my learning; Dr. Baskin-Sommers provides really patient and detailed feedback on ed discussion and other communication channels   Weakness: While I liked the content of the assignments, the grading rubrics might be modified a little especially for the last essay so that students can focus more on the content they want to write about, instead of trying to pigeonhole their material into the various criteria."
99122,"The course explains vital information about race and crime and how problematic the system is currently that are very important which is a strength. Also, this course brings depth to the psychology courses and major. There is also a great structure to the class and everything is easy to connect to each other. The exams were very well designed for better understanding."
99122,I really enjoyed the way she formatted the class!
99122,Very well organized and engaging. Very easy to learn and interesting topics!
99122,It was a PHENOMENAL CLASS.
99122,"The topic was very interesting and Prof. Baskin-Sommers is super approachable and nice! Answers ed discussion and any questions very quickly  I enjoyed lecture but sometimes it would get very into the science which I did not expect. It was often hard to stay engaged. I also did not realize that this case would more so be an overview on different disorders that lead to the criminal mind (this was the focus), it would have been good to learn about a few case studies or tie in the material we learn to an actual event/crime."
99122,"Lecture slides are not great, nothing done to reinforce the concepts, teachers own political beliefs sprinkled in."
99122,"Strengths of the course include very clear lectures, very engaging lectures, interesting material and readings, and fair grading. I don't think the course has any weaknesses."
99122,good
99122,Everything was wonderful and I learned so much! My only feedback would be to have more accessible office hours. I felt like some TAs at times gave me information that harmed rather than helped on the assignments.
99122,"Such a well-organized and thoughtful course. By far the greatest strength, though, is prof Baskin-Sommers. I dont think there are any glaring weaknesses."
99122,taught soooo well. so organized and such a fair exam
99122,"Good survey of everything, maybe some more interactive things in lectures when it comes to learning about the brain structures in particular, because that can be hard to visualize."
99122,"I loved this course. The coursework was very engaging and clear, and I really loved the way in which we were tested, in terms of the essays. I honestly would've loved to have some free response questions on the exams."
99122,"I think there is honestly room for just more content. Lectures usually went for an hour instead of an hour 15 minutes, and the pace was very slow in my opinion. I wish there was more discussion about the frameworks of criminality itself and questioning this framework in the broadest societal sense. In other words, questioning the ways in which society expects us to conform, and the implications on the labelling of certain actions or personality types as ""criminal"" or designating psychopathology upon them.  I also wish she'd included more of her own personal experience! It was very literature-heavy which is typical of a psychology course, but I have the sense she has a lot of more affective/subjective experience we could learn from."
99122,"It is very easy to succeed in this course if you complete all of the work. Assignment expectations are clearly explained ahead of time and then the work is graded very fairly. Lecture is engaging, never runs overtime, and covers a lot of interesting content. The professors and TFs closely monitor the Ed Discussion so it is easy to get timely answers to any questions."
99122,"Maybe, lectures at times could be a bit more engaging. Other than that, I have no feedback to offer! Great Class!"
99122,"Strengths: The class was extremely organized, the professor worked incredibly hard to make sure students succeeded in the class, the content was extremely interesting, the workload was reasonable and relevant to the class."
99122,The professor is incredible.
99122,"Strengths: The workload is not too high, and some of the topics are interesting. The professor is very active on Ed discussion.  Weaknesses: I really did not like the multiple choice quizzes or exams since they seem very nitpicky on wording and try to trick you."
99122,"Lecturer is probably one of the best here at Yale. Professor Baskin-Sommers is very direct and honest, and presents facts, not opinions. She also is very engaging.  Weaknesses - lots of assignments. 2 exams and 3 essays, which can feel like busy work but is important. Exams or essays are not too difficult."
99122,"This class was honestly very fun. Lectures were engaging and the assignments supported learning of the information. It isnt the best course Ive taken, but I would certainly take it again."
99122,No weaknesses!! The class is great. I learned well in lecture and the weekly quizzes allow you to retain more info before the exams!
99122,"The professor is such a strength. Professor Baskin-Sommers is such an incredible professor. She is interesting to listen to, engages with students, and truly is an expert in her field."
99122,Very interesting - I loved it!!
99122,I loved how fast grades and exam feedback was returned to the students. The professor did an amazing job listening to the student feedback and IMPLEMENTING it.
99122,the essays in this class made sure you understood the topic well. Test corrections were allowed so that you could make sure to understand any questions you missed on the exam.
99122,The exams were harder for me because the questions did not just ask about definitions but situations as well. The essays were my strong suite.
99122,Strengths are that Professor Baskin-Sommers is awesome!! She was so engaging and taught so well. I felt like she wants us to do well and learn. We also got test corrections to learn from our mistakes. Not many weaknesses. This class was great. So interesting.
99122,Prof. Baskin-Sommers is the strength!
99122,"This course was excellent. I especially found the lectures engaging, and overall course organization was superb."
99122,Loved lecture. The organization and material presented were great. I loved that she ended class early when we finished fast. Super clear teaching. Didnt love watching the graphic videos for so longwe got the point after 30 sec dont need 10 min
99122,Arielle is amazing! The course was very engaging and the guest lecturers were great!
99122,All strengths. Great class.
99122,"It was very well developed to facilitate learning. Lectures were so engaging, we learned about fascinating and applicable topic with real world people coming in, we were tested in a way that helped us learn and was never punitive.  The only weakness was that the essay assignments felt like I wasnt learning as much since I was so concerned about following the rubric and instructions which were complicated."
99122,"The course was very well organized, had many opportunities to get points back and interesting."
99122,"I think this is a fantastic class and is super enlightening. Not only is it interesting learn about, but it is super fascinating especially going to school in New Haven."
99122,Course was extremely well thought out and administered. No need for improvement!
99122,"The content was very interesting and engaging. However, I think the lecture size was too big for there to be high levels of engagement from everyone and it felt awkward answering or asking questions."
99122,"strengths: lectures were easy to follow and were extremely engaging, workload was manageable,  weaknesses: information didn't feel cohesive at times"
99122,Dr. Baskin-Sommers was an extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic lecturer. She made each lecture very engaging. I can't really think of an obvious weaknesses.
99122,None. I absolutely ADORED this course
99122,very good
99122,Its very good that we are allowed to do corrections to get points back.
99122,Strengths were the weekly quizzes and clear content presented by the instructor.
99122,Amazing Professor!
99122,"strengths: covered both the science and the policy, engaging , relevant weaknesses: essay grading/feedback somewhat inconsistent based on TF so difficult to learn how to improve"
99122,"Strengths - fascinating content, excellent professor, good structure Weaknesses - felt like the content in the first part of the class was covered for a little too long before moving on"
99122,I thought the professor was very helpful. She lectured clearly. Only weakness was it was too big of a class. It was hard to focus in such a big space with so many people
99122,Course is very well run with expectations from the professor begin very clear.
99122,The strength of the course is Dr. Baskin-Sommers. She is an incredibly bright individual with an incredible view on the world when it comes to psychopathic and antisocial behavior. The weakness is the size. I wish I could've got more personalized learning through this semester.
99122,Really quick feedback and the TFs and professor were always willing to help.
99122,"This course was great! It was really engaging and one of my favorite classes I have ever taken. The grading was a little harsh, but you get 1/2 credit back on exams. As long as you go to lecture and put in effort, you should succeed."
99122,"Strengths: super chill class, quizzes are easy, really really interesting, professor is great Weaknesses: the class being very relaxed can also be considered a weakness if youre looking for something challenging"
99122,Very organized but lecture can be redundant
99122,All strength. No weakness.
99122,"Strengths - After the first few weeks of class and once you get used to the neuroscience aspects of it the class topics get really interesting. Weaknesses - Grading is done very strictly, assignments and essays must be worded carefully or youll be docked off points"
99122,Very structured class and clear feedback on writing. No weaknesses.
99122,Some of the more entertaining lectures I have been to and there is a healthy learning and testing environment
99122,"Strengths: richness and depth to the research; Prof. Baskin-Sommers made sure to use replicated and reliable sources. AMAZING guest speakers.  Weaknesses: too much emphasis on research and one specific type of ""criminality,"" aka antisocial/conduct disorder/psychopathy"
99122,"Professor BS has a very engaging lecture style, and it is easy to follow along with her words. I found the weekly quizzes effective in engaging my interest.   The essays were difficult because it was hard to understand the degree of detail the teachers were looking for. I wish that there were more sample essays posted online beforehand."
99122,"Professor Baskin-Sommers is a treasure - one of the most responsive and kind individuals I have ever encountered, especially for a professor."
99122,"I think that the content is very interesting, but I wish the lectures were more engaging. I also think the assignment grading did not make sense and was not clear in instructions."
99122,"Well structured, interesting and engaging"
99122,"Professor Baskin-Sommers has her shit. She's super organized, kind with grading, and overall just cares about your learning. I think you'll learn a TON in this class without even trying too much, just because Prof is GOAT."
99122,"Hands down the most organized and well-taught class I've taken at Yale! I LOVE this class and Prof. Baskin-Sommers! I'm such a fan of her!  Everything is so organized. Prof and the TFs are always on top of everything (grade quickly, respond quickly, always available). The content is very interesting."
99122,"This class had a lot of strengths like access to class recordings towards the time that big assignments were so. I wish there were more ways for us to engage and discuss the material in the way thats required of us in our essays before theyre actually due. Additionally, I really appreciated the chance to do test corrections because I did learn more while doing those."
99122,This course is very information packed but is taught is taught in a very organized way. I loved this course and the professor. Truly highly recommend to everyone.
99122,Very well organized and great professor who knows her stuff. Slides are easy to follow but often dont have all the information you need to understand the lecture - you need to hear the professor speak as well.
99122,"Strengths: professor was a good lecturer, the class was VERY organized (this was so amazing I can't stress this enough- you always knew what you had to do and what to do to get a good grade), lectures were engaging, topics were interesting, Ed questions were answered speedily and had very good answers Weaknesses: none"
99122,I loved lectures.
99122,Lectures are amazing.
99122,"The course has plenty of strengths: all course materials are highly structured, the contents are fascinating, all assignments have a high degree of clarity, PowerPoints are posted before class so you can take notes on them, and the teaching team always provides timely responses to questions posted in Ed discussion."
99122,I think this was one of the best courses Ive ever taken!
99122,well structure to facilitate learning.
99122,Great classloved the set up no recommendations!
99122,"I think this class has a helpful blend of poli sci and neuro but I wish I had known how much policy would be included in the course. I went into it thinking that it would be more heavily neuro, and then felt confused with the syllabus.  I wish there was more opportunity for creativity in essays 1 or 2 (theyre basically filling out a template) but they did help me know the course material better!"
99122,"I thought the lectures were interesting, but could have been more engaging."
99122,I think a strength of the course was the clear layout of the powerpoint slides. I think a weakness of the course was the lack of recordings until the midterm. This made it difficult to review concepts that I struggled with in class.
99122,I thought everything was great. I think Professor Baskin-Sommers does a great job explaining in lecture as well as making the homework engaging but not overly stressful. It definitely helped me feel excited about the course throughout the semester.
99122,"strengths: very well taught and organized by professor, timely feedback and very consistent deadlines and review sessions"
99122,"I really enjoyed the opportunity to improve on the exams! I learned a lot through this method, and all the assignments were helpful to strengthen my knowledge of the course material."
99122,"This class was taught extremely well, I have no complaints. The professor was engaging, knowledgeable, and funny."
99122,"Strengths: Professor Basker-Sommers is a great lecturer, passionate about what she teaches. Weaknesses: Low engagement in the class."
99122,i think perhaps this was my favorite/what i feel like was the best run lecture course i've taken yet in my time here!
99122,"This course was one of the most engaging courses that I have been in! I always looked forward to attending lecture! I think there was a lot of disparity in the grading of assignments, where some students were very successful and some students were severely penalized. They didn't always seem evenly graded by TAs."
99122,Organization was impeccable. Downside was lectures could lack engagement
99122,The course moved very quickly and covered a lot of material. I think it would have helped to have a discussion section once a week with a TA and a session or two dedicated to learning strategies on how to answer exam questions.
99122,Lectures were sometimes confusing
99122,Amazinggggg class
99122,I think it was really well run. The only thing is the essay grading from some of the TAs seemed extremely harsh.
99122,Strengths: the content is fairly stimulating and professor baskin sommers is fantastic. She answers emails quickly and thoughtfully which is remarkable in a 500 person lecture.  Weaknesses: its one of those classes that I wish was a seminar.
99122,"interesting lectures, helpful professor"
99122,"I think the information in this course was very well organized and really interesting as a result of its connections with real-life incidents we see. I also enjoyed the special sections that discussed class topics in the context of current events. I think this course could be improved by incorporating some more molecular neuroscience information as it relates to the disorders that were discussed. Although this class is cross-listed as an NSCI course, there were only some molecular neuroscience concepts discussed and they were not explained in as much detail as was outlined in the research studies we read. I also think this class had too many assignments to keep track of and it ended up being a much higher workload than an elective-type class should be. It seems that there is no need for weekly quizzes, two exams, AND three essays. The last exam and final essay were due within a very short timeframe of each other. If just one essay was cut the workload would become much more manageable."
99122,"Strengths: Extremely clearly outlined, Professor Baskin-Sommers is unbelievably responsive on EdDiscussion to hundreds of students oftentimes within minutes. She is also very knowledgeable. There is little ambiguity in grading and expectations; extremely crystal clear so you KNOW how to excel in this course. I still don't know how Prof BS manages to do everything she does. It baffles me, and I need to have a look at her GCal or do one of those Vogue 73 questions interviews with her. Many teaching staff in this course are excellent and pack a punch with their teaching. The evidence in the course material is also very good and interesting. There are some studies that are cited in the lectures that are really old and borderline unethical, but overall I really enjoyed learning about how the bridge between mind and behavior was linked through research methods in the course. (Big) Weaknesses: The course only briefly touches upon the name of the course itself. I believe it glares over individuals who commit crimes just to get by (steal to survive), and it is never emphasized save for two slides out of the hundreds of slides covered in the course total. This likely reflects a problem within the field of Psychology itself, where it places the onus, purposefully or not, on the individual in terms of the outcomes that arise from socially constructed problems, yet labels people as criminals. Maybe a better course name would be ""The Psychology of Criminal Behavior,"" but that wouldn't pack much of a punch, now would it? I am deeply dissatisfied with this lack of presentation of nuance about criminal behavior within the course, despite there being ample space for it. Professor BS said in a tiny way that there was ""no such thing as one criminal mind"" at the final lecture, and I think that should occupy more of the course. Overall, more nuance about research methods and the relationship between mind and behavior, particularly as it relates to there being NO single 'criminal mind'."
99122,Strengths: quizzes keep you on top of paying attention in class
99122,"Strengths: Professor Baskin-Sommers!! She is easily the best professor I've had at Yale. She's a wonderful lecturer who explains concepts with complete clarity, and she's also very entertaining. The course was incredibly organized and interesting, especially in the second half of the semester. Lectures were amazingly structured, well-paced, and easy to follow. Assignments, exams, and essays were straight-forward and very fair. Very light and manageable workload. Overall an incredible course! Weaknesses: I wish we hadn't had both a final paper and final exam but it really wasn't too bad"
99122,Strengths include the quizzes and poll everywhere. Both kept me engaged throughout the term. A weakness is the exams. I think they would be better with some long answer questions instead of just multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank.
99122,Strength: Very informative. Organized.  Weakness: Very U.S. centric.
99122,"The class is on pretty interesting content, so I really enjoyed learning more about the subject. Great class."
99122,Professor Baskin-Sommers is a fantastic lecturer and a very fair professor. I thought all of the assignments were really helpful in terms of cementing the concepts discussed and their implications in my mind.
99122,"I really love the structure of grading and assignments and the course material, but I think it could be improved by making the lectures slightly more engaging."
99122,Very interesting content and amazing professor
99122,The professor was a huge strength of the course because she was amazing and involved with every single student if they wanted her to be. A weakness on my end was not utilizing office hours as much with the TFs.
99122,Course was centered around memorization more than actual understanding of the content covered. This was reflected through the multiple choice exams without any written content. I wish we did more things like the final essay which I felt was the only instance in which we were actually asked to apply what we had learned to the real world
99122,Weaknesses: can get a bit draggy Strengths: the course is very interesting
99122,"The course is excellently taught. Prof Baskin Sommers is clear and direct with her instructions for every assignment. A critique I had is the exam format and lack of reliable internet in the exam room making it difficult to complete the exams. Additionally, I think the second essay didn't need as much of a guide as it had."
99122,"This class is designed for you to succeed in every possible way. The syllabus is clear and tells you which readings will be on the exam or can be used in essays. The lectures are clear and the slides are posted beforehand, so you can focus on listening to the professor rather than copying everything down, and the lectures are recorded. There are review sessions for each exam, the questions are fair, and the grading is laid out clearly. There is a platform where students can submit questions that the professor and TAs monitor regularly. The weaknesses had to do with the other students. It's a huge class, so you can't engage as much, and it feels like many students don't pay much attention. It was sad sometimes to see that a large majority of the class didn't take the course seriously and missed out on a really amazing learning opportunity, especially since so many people wanted to take the class and couldn't."
99122,"It was very interesting and facilitated learning, but grading was way too harsh for essays. I thoroughly enjoyed the course, but it proved to be a constant stress throughout the year because of the harsh grading, on things I felt were my best work. Sometimes it felt that points were taken away for no apparent reason."
99122,"I think the strengths of the class are the format of the class, the professor and TAs were all awesome, and I think there was a lot of interesting information in the lectures while also keeping a large class engaged by adding videos and visuals."
99122,I thought it was a very good course. No suggestions for making it better.
99122,Strengths: great instructor  Weaknesses: repetitive content
99122,This course is so great. Maybe more small group meetings would have been helpful!
99122,It was literally a perfect class! No improvements
99122,It was an awesome course! It was engaging and provided plenty of feedback to learn from.
99122,I liked the content of the course overall but I think it would be better if it centered Black and PoC voices more.
99123,having a final essay randomly and what is essentially two final exams is not fun
99123,The lectures move at a very fast pace which can be nice. However I found it hard to follow along in class at times
99123,"strengths: the content is really important, a good way to get started in understanding neuroscience weaknesses: the lectures were essentially a regurgitation of the slides and most of the learning came from reading the textbook. Quizzes were INCREDIBLY inconsistent, with no indication when to expect them, and they were due within hours of being posted on canvas. Overall organization is very poor."
99123,Strengths: The material is well-paced and the lectures are very organized. The course is super interesting and perhaps one of the most applicable to daily life that you might take during your time here. Prof. Kober is AMAZING.   Weaknesses: The lectures sometimes moved a little fast but there are plenty of office hours to clarify anything you might have missed so it's fine. The assigned readings can be a little lengthy at times.
99123,"Weakness: In a single lecture, a lot of material is covered. However, to fit it all in, Professor speaks really fast. Despite this, recordings are not shared afterwards. There is also an extra paper towards the end that feels like busywork Strength: interesting material and professor tries to make time for questions throughout lecture"
99123,"Strengths: the professor is incredible, the content is so so interesting and relevant to everyone, I liked the structure of the class since it incentivized staying engaged but didn't add too much stress with weekly assignments  Weaknesses: none!"
99123,"strengths: well organized, useful content, engaging professor weakness: the content goes SO fast and it is hard to keep up during lectures. and it truly is SO MUCH content"
99123,"Strengths: Kober is a great lecturer; lecture guides and pdf slides are good;  Weaknesses: Breadth of information needed to learn is simply too large; I would appreciate more homework assignments because I found myself disengaged from the class until we had an exam. More sensitivity around drugs such as antidepressants, often felt lecture dismissed and/or judged them waY too much"
99123,"Strengths: This neuroscience class covers interesting material that can surprise even those with prior knowledge of certain drugs. The course provides valuable insights into the biological basis of drug actions and the underlying neurotransmitter processes.  Weaknesses: While the class has potential, it falls short of expectations. It attempts to cover too much ground, including drug history, disorders, and legalities, making it difficult for most students to keep up with the professor's fast-paced lectures. The teaching staff doesn't provide lecture material in advance, which can be a challenge for non-science students. There are many quizzes and exams that determine the majority of one's grade, but the grading is often opaque or untimely. Some quizzes are just excluded from the class for unclear reasons. Overall, the most apparent weakness of the class is its logistics."
99123,"So much information, and little work, so you have to be willing to put in the work studying in order to get a good grade."
99123,It should just be an advanced neuroscience elective cause that's what the expectations of students are. For the amount of content on exams and how niche the questions are you really need a weekly pset or some way of keeping up with the material. This class should not be marketed as an intro with no prior experience needed.
99123,I liked having choice on exams. I didn't like having to do the paper during reading week. The prompt should have been released sooner.
99123,"TFs kept saying we dont need to memorize the tiny details, but that is in fact what you need to memorize. this course is all memorization and students are tested on very specific information from lectures, which is fine, but the teaching team just needs to be more upfront about it.   A lot of information was miscommunicated to us, such as when quizzes were happening, some quizzes we only got from 5pm one day to 10am the next morning to complete, others before that gave us several days to take the quiz, there was no consistency, it was all a bit scrambled."
99123,"Strengths - very interesting material, structured well to allow you to learn the basics of neurotransmission and the nervous system before learning the details of drugs Weaknesses - professor speaks very fast, and there are no recordings and limited prep material for exams"
99123,"The material in this course is very interesting and helpful! I enjoyed learning it, and I feel like I am walking away with a The actual organization of the course was not great. The self-tests, for example, were not evenly spread, nor did they run on a consistent schedule. This made it really difficult to do well on or to plan. I also believe the class was needlessly strict. Calling out students for speaking when many of us had not noticed, needing a Deans excuse for a zoom lecture, it felt greatly bureaucratic. I thus did not feel comfortable reaching out to the TAs or the Professor for help."
99123,"I thought it was honestly a great course along all lines. I also really liked having choice on exams, which I always thought I would implement myself if I became a teacher in the future. It just makes a lot of sense, because people study different things and have different strengths. It kind of removes the element of luck in exams, which is great."
99123,"strengths = good content  weakness = hard to gaugae how youre doing in the class, tests are hard (better to credit D and not have to worry), lectures were hard to follow (hedy spoke very fast) and not recorded and slides were not posted until after class. Hard to succeed"
99123,"The course was very poorly organized, and it was hard to know where I stood. The assessments were very challenging, too long and too specific. They were also not at all well spaced throughout the semester."
99123,"The course covered a lot of content. I honestly think more assessments would be useful to help solidify learning. Also, lectures move very quickly so perhaps more review. Overall though the course is very thorough and comprehensive."
99123,"Every question on the exams came down to memorization of topics that can be easily googled. Having learned so much, both in specific content and broader ideas, it would have been nice for the exams to cover these two aspects half and half. I also wish the second midterm wasn't two weeks before the end of classes."
99123,"Not a beginner neuroscience class, LOTS of new material to know after every class and professor talks very fast and does not provide slides before class"
99123,"One of the main strengths of the course is that even though its an intro class meant for non majors, it still gives you a ton of information and knowledge that you will apply to your life. Also, the format of exams is great. The only weakness is that the professor is an incredibly fast talker, which makes it difficult to take adequate notes in lecture."
99123,"Strengths: I like how the course was formatted. Her lectures were very straight-forward and she was always eager to answer students' questions.   Weaknesses: The self-test format was really just a pop quiz with a vague heads-up given before hand. The study guides were not very helpful, it would have been nice to have a mock test or ones from previous years to prepare with. The review sessions were also not very helpful, I think the format should be completely revised. The test review format was also terrible, if the grades can be released on gradescope for students to see it on their own would be much more useful. If this is not an option, there should be a sign up sheet through calendly for student to select times to review their exams individually so people do not have to sit around for upwards of an hour and still not get to see their exams."
99123,"The course material was interesting. I would have appreciated more frequent self-tests so that each individual one would have less impact on the grade. Also, the pace was a little too quick."
99123,"I wish the course was more slow-paced. The lectures have very important and interesting content, but this class goes through a lot of content. The lecture recordings are not accessible to everyone, so you have to rely on the lectures slides (which are posted after lectures and sometimes late)."
99123,"The lectures for this class are so good! Prof Kober is an amazing lecturer -- honestly I think that if you focus 100% in class you will remember everything needed for the exam.  No weaknesses, though I think you need to be personally interested in the content to enjoy the class and stay attentive."
99123,"This is class is interesting and accessible to non- STEM students, but it TAs office hours were hard to get to in order to get help. Hours closer to evening or with multiple people allowed to attend at one time could be better. I'm sure I had the same difficulties as other humanities majors, but we were all waiting in line to have a private session with the TA on Fridays. Sometimes I went to office hours but then had to leave before I got my chance because so many people were ahead of me."
99123,"The course content is intriguing and applicable to real life. Its structure is clear and helpful to facilitate learning: it begins with basic knowledge about the brain and neurotransmission, then discusses each drug in detail, and ends with treatment for addiction. It would be better to reserve more time for treatment, as we ran out of time to discuss CBT and MBT in more detail at the end."
99123,I feel that the content was well expanded upon but I also feel that these sections were moved through at a pace that moved too quickly. I think talking through the mechanisms at a slower pace would be helpful. I would have also really appreciate having access to recorded sessions so that I could review content after class.
99123,"While Dr. Kober is a charismatic lecturer, she is by no means a successful teacher. Her lectures are just an hour and fifteen minutes of her info dumping at an unreasonable speed, but she did make some minor adjustments (like adding page numbers to the slides) that helped to offset the consequences of the fast pace of her lectures. The few grades you get in the class are incredibly high stakes and do not set you up to properly absorb the material. At the end of the day, this is a traditional lecture. It's unfortunate because Dr. Kober knows what she's talking about and the content is incredibly interesting, but the educational pedagogy underlying the execution of the course leaves a lot to be desired. There are a few incredibly easy adjustments that can be made for this course to make it more engaging in the future, however. For one thing, allowing for the self-tests to be retaken as many times as needed to get 100% would encourage students to master the material. It would also be helpful if the self-tests had been on a consistent schedule, rather than being randomly announced and being given a small window of time to complete them. Giving a full 24 hours at the minimum to complete the self-tests would have been helpful. In general, having more opportunities to receive grades in the course that could boost your grade rather than praying for the curve to serve you well on the three exams you do would have made this course less stressful. One of the major successes of the course was the fact that the exams are uniquely structured to allow students to select which questions they want to answer from the question pool provided. Another thing that would have been helpful is if she would have left up the text-heavy slides longer than she would the slides that were filled more with pictures or less text to allow for students to catch up on the content they missed."
99123,Strengths: Really interesting lectures and material. Prof Kober is 10/10 the best. Puts so much effort into the class.  Improve: - more efficient ways of viewing exams after - TAs didnt know the material in as much detail as we had to so they couldnt really answer all questions
99123,"Self-tests and practice questions provided by the teaching team were a great way to evaluate your knowledge and identify gaps prior to exams, and the team was always responsive and readily available to assist with questions. Because each lecture was so information-heavy, at times it was difficult to keep up / know what the most important takeaways were. May be helped by slightly better organization of slides / more consistent summary slides to drill home the big picture."
99123,"Strengths: lots of material covered, provides information relevant to people of our age group Weakness: slides arent very put together, professor talks too fast"
99123,"The class draws a lot from real life and incorporates everyday examples well. There is a _lot_ of material to go over. A lot of it is rushed through in class, and students are often not left with enough time to comprehend everything or write things down in class."
99123,"I think we could've done more practice problems in class, application questions"
99123,"Strengths: This class is SO interesting. You are truly learning every single day. Kober is also a great lecturer and makes the class fun while also being serious in regard to the material being discussed.  Weaknesses: This course is definitely more fit for STEM/Psych majors, as it builds on previous knowledge of the brain. Even though it is advertised as not requiring previous knowledge, it is very science-based and will be challenging. I do think that another improvement would be removing either the paper or a test. Currently, the course has many examinations, and it makes it challenging to study for the final while also working on the final paper. I also think that if a notecard was allowed on the exam, this would be very helpful and place a higher emphasis on the understanding material rather than memorizing specifics about certain drugs."
99123,i thought the professor talked too fast and most of the time when i understood a concept it was because i taught myself or a friend taught me. i wouldve liked to have q better understanding of how different concepts connected to have a cohesive picture
99123,"Strengths: Prof Kober was incredibly interesting! She moves so fast during lectures, but you will learn so much. Just make sure to go back and look over the lectures later that day/week instead of waiting until the week of the exam. There is so much information.  Weaknesses: This is more for me, but learning needs to be self-facilitated in this class. You really need to put in the time outside of class to do well. Doing the readings, going to office hours, sponging 2-4 hours outside of class each week looking at the lectures again in order to have all the information sink in because there is so much to learn."
99123,This is an excellent course although the exams are quite difficult.
99123,Please please get a better room for this lecture. The wifi on my computer would mess up every lecture and I would have to take notes on my phone. I also could barely hear a professor who self-identified as talking very fast.
99123,Strengths: The lectures were engaging and the textbook was really helpful. Weaknesses: The course was structured to incentivize cheating and disadvantage students who were honest. This felt really demoralizing at times. It could be fixed by either making the self-tests open-note or holding them in-class (closed-note).
99123,"Lecture was way too fast and there was too much content to remember for each drug. This class was way too heavy on the biochemistry of drugs (brain) and less attention was paid to the behavior aspect of the class. There were spontaneous canvas assignments that did not have announcements, so if you were a couple minutes late to class one day you would end up with a zero on an assignment, with no way to make it up. The exams were also very difficult."
99123,"strengths, prof kober has a great lecturing style and i love learning from her, but a big weakness in the class is the exam structure. i felt as if, after the exams, i wasnt fully preparing to learn the material needed and instead i had to just memorize because of the many exam questions and time restraints."
99123,"I think the class moved a bit too fast at times, and I think the amount of material was a bit unrealistic for exams. I really enjoyed the material, and the lectures were very engaging and very interesting. I loved the course material and Professor Kober as a lecturer."
99123,"The course was really strong until the last few weeks. The Professor really doesnt know what shes talking about when she got into the history of drugs and their prohibition she routinely spread misinformation and was not receptive at all to fact checking. It very much felt like she was trying to peddle an agenda.  The exams were also routinely misgraded. Errors made me lose several points on each exam, to the point that corrections boosted one of my scores by over a letter grade! The curve was also never clearly explained  Apart from those things, though 5/5."
99123,Strengths are the content is interesting but weaknesses are there is way too much content for an intro level neuroscience class. It moves too quickly through the content and requires a lot of out of class attention for memorization and understanding
99123,"I LOVED this course. Prof. Kober is incredibly passionate about the material and about her students, and really thoughtful about how she organizes the course, presents information, and adapts the course in response to feedback throughout the term. The ONE THING is that she has a tendency to talk very fast, which made her lectures hard to follow sometimes, especially as someone who has only taken one neuroscience course before this one."
99123,"Strengths: Interesting material, passionate lecturer, workload is not too heavy day-to-day Weaknesses: The material is a little too advanced/is taught too quickly for people without STEM backgrounds and exams are tricky"
99123,"The lectures were great, and the workload was not terrible. Material was interesting, and depth of coverage felt pretty good. Don't have much to say about its improvement."
99123,"Professor Kober speaks really fast and it is hard to follow the course if you have no neuroscience experience, even though the syllabus says otherwise."
99123,"The course was organized so very well. Professor Kober was an amazing lecturer, and she did a great job at explaining the material. The exams were graded quite harshly and even with substantial studying some of the questions felt tough, but the class is curved."
99123,"Weakness: Learning the material or taking notes during class is very difficult because the professor glides through slides too quickly. Also, class recordings are not readily available despite the fact that the class is recorded"
99123,"Strengths: incredibly applicable to college life, really interesting, meaningful, and cool content that is fun to study, not a lot of reading and no psets, being able to have choice for the exam questions was awesome and helped with studying Weaknesses: class is incredibly fast-paced and you have to be hyper-focused during lectures which makes them feel very high stakes, rubrics for exam questions is pretty picky and looks for buzz words, both mid-terms (especially the first one) were very long"
99123,The lectures were very engaging.
99123,"This course has really interesting, manifestly relevant subject matter. Unfortunately, I found that this class was not set up to maximize learning, and was instead structured to promote competition and increase student stress. Often, the speed of lecture delivery, and the amount of time allocated to different subjects, made it difficult to understand and review the more complex dimensions of the subject matter. I felt that a lot of lecture time was dedicated to less science-y aspects of the material, and that the course, despite being labeled as not having prerequisites, relied on a very solid base of neuroscience knowledge that was difficult to gain just from the courses introductory weeks. In addition, I tried to attend office hours numerous times during which no TF was present, which made it hard for me to review concepts I was confused about. I ended up having to CR/D this class to avoid having it ruin my grade point average."
99123,"Strengths: enthusiastic, intelligent (and expert on the subject matter), caring professor; interesting subject matter; logical organization. Weaknesses: lectures went way too fast; exams were very difficult; it was difficult to get feedback on exams because exams were never returned and students had to review exams one at a time with TF's at office hours, which was inefficient for students and TF's."
99123,"Very interesting content, but can be a little dense"
99123,A lot of extra info that makes it confusing to filter
99123,"Strengths: Prof. Kober is the main strength. She's an excellent lecturer and I usually felt engaged in class. The class was not overwhelming with homework or projects.   Weaknesses: You shouldn't have to go to office hours and sit 1-on-1 to get exam feedback. Also, such huge percentages of our grade were staked on just exams. Readings should not be used as -- if you read it you can get one more point on the exam."
99123,Exams were hard and a lot of material to memorize and learn. But super interesting.
99123,"One weakness was that I think there were a lot of topics in the course the professor spoke about as if we should know, such as certain drugs and how they might affect the body. Students heavily involved in neuroscience definitely had an advantage. I also did not like how we were not able to see our exams unless we went to office hours with the TFs, which was pretty difficult to do. Also, the majority of TFs were not very helpful. A strength was that the professor was passionate about the topic and that came through in her teaching."
99123,"The strengths are the Hedy's seemingly unlimited knowledge about every drug and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the lectures on each drug were well done and designed to teach effectively. I would have preferred one less lecture on alcohol in order to cover another type of drug, perhaps inhalants, but overall really great stuff."
99123,"Many chances to improve grade. Interesting material,"
99123,The content is occasionally interesting but the way the class is very poorly organized.
99123,"Very organised, great slides, office hours, SUPER engaging lecture. Hedy is the best."
99123,"Strengths: Hedy is a great lecturer and material is really interesting! Weaknesses: this class is not a gut and is seriously hard, especially if you're not a science (particularly neuro/cogsci major). The material moves really quickly -- probably too quickly honestly -- and I struggled to study for tests because there's so much material it can be a bit overwhelming. Also the final paper, while meant to be a grade booster, just forced me to spend a few unnecessary hours during reading week when I could have been studying instead or doing work on more important assignments during reading week. I would have preferred a few problem sets over the course of the semester to 1. avoid having an essay and 2. so that each test mattered less (and so that I was forced to think about / review the material before the tests, which had so so much material on them). I feel like this class is farmed as an intro or accessible course when it's really not -- you'll probably end up enjoying the class since the material is really interesting, but you should be prepared to really grind or Cr/D it (which a lot of my friends did) if the tests don't go so well. Also I wish it was easier to view our tests after getting our grades back."
99123,Definitely very science heavy... NOT a gut.
99123,"This course requires a lot of time and energy, even though it is marketed as a class for non-majors. I think the expectations could have been much clearer. Even if the content we were being tested on could not have been shared, it would have been helpful to know the format of the exams beforehand. I also know that there were concerns about sending out lecture slides before the class, but it would have been helpful if the handouts that were sent out for 3 classes were more consistent so we could have a better frame of reference for what we were going over in class. I also would have appreciated getting the prompt for the final essay a bit sooner than reading week when it was due, because there are many other assignments due at this time and not knowing what the expectations were made it difficult to plan ahead. While we were told that the paper would be simple/not take much time, different people have different strengths, workloads, and experience with this type of assignment and the lack of time couple with the assurance that the lack of time was fine, did not seem to acknowledge these differences. Also the lack of consistency with when/how self tests were administered made them less helpful than they could have been, especially because they died off by the middle of the semester, which meant they weren't as helpful for preparing for tests as I assumed they would be."
99136,"Strengths: - MDR is a character and fantastic at explaining concepts in a digestible manner. You'll find him referencing Lady Gaga, Olivia Rodrigo, and Taylor Swift as part of his explanations of these abstract philosophical ideas. I did barely any of the readings and was still able to follow along and succeed in the course thanks to his teaching. - Concepts are incredibly interesting. You answer questions like ""does God exist?"" and ""how do we know anything is real?"" - Lectures are organized yet have plenty of room for questions, which is incredibly important for a class of this nature.  Weaknesses: None"
99136,"Strengths include the reading selections and topics of focus. No weaknesses, though I was confused by how long we spent on Descartes at the beginning of the semester. It seemed to be moving quite slowly, and I wish we could have distributed the semester more equally."
99136,"Strength: lectures are helpful and sections help strengthen what we learned in class  Weakness: we didn't get to finish Kant, which is actually an important part of the final exam"
99136,"strengths: clear and informative lectures weaknesses: doesn't teach beginners how to better engage with the material, steep learning curve"
99136,"The course is thorough and thought-provoking. However, I feel like it would benefit the class to expand from its Eurocentric roots to explore modern philosophy from other cultures as well."
99136,"Weaknesses- I dislike the grade distribution between 2 papers and a final exam, lectures alone don't really prepare you enough to write papers"
99136,"Strengths: I truly enjoyed MDR's lectures. His energy was infectious and he was overall very skilled at explaining difficult concepts with friendly analogies for the beginner philosophy student. The content is also quite fascinating, and MDR does a great job drilling these concepts into your head. Review for the final was quite straightforward and easy, which took off a lot of pressure during reading period.  Weaknesses: As this was my first philosophy course, I wish there was more support in structuring philosophy papers. Feedback for my papers was quite sparse and unclear, and I was often left confused as to how I could improve my writing. Grading was extremely subjective to the TFs, and the essays really do make/break your grade. I would have appreciated a greater number of smaller assessments/essays spread out through the semester. In addition, because we only had two essays and a final, it was easy to become disengaged in between these assignments."
99136,"Strengths: Lecturer, discussion sections, material. Weaknesses: Final exam instead of a final paper."
99136,"Very lecture-y. No powerpoint slides to refer to or anything, which made it a bit difficult to keep up sometimes. This is a classic case of a class where you get back the amount of effort/work you put into the class."
99136,Generally a really great course. All of the information is provided in an accessible and interesting way.
99136,very interesting material at a good pace
99136,"A strength of the course was how well-organized it was. Each text and specific excerpt that we were assigned to read felt essential to the course. As a history major, I enjoyed being able to step back from the philosophical details and get a broader sense of how Western philosophy developed over time. Professor Della Rocca was also a major strength of the course. He's a super engaging lecturer and explains confusing concepts well. The TFs were also great!"
99136,"Strength: MDR is a great lecturer. He breaks down the often complex and obscure arguments of each philosopher really well and conveys their arguments in a clear, engaging, humorous way. He is also one of the most patient and caring professors I've met at Yale - talking to him during office hours is a pleasure. As someone who has never done philosophy before and is always kind of daunted by the idea of philosophy, MDR's class gave me a wonderful start and made me feel encouraged to take more similar classes in the future. Weaknesses: I don't think this is a weakness per se, but MDR refers only occasionally to the readers we do before class, and oftentimes his delivery is so clear that there is no need to do the readings at all unless you make the effort to go talk to him during office hours --- if not navigating the readings on your own can be pretty challenging. Nonetheless, you still get a really good overview of these philosophers just through MDR's lecture alone, just be aware that this is digested through his perspective."
99136,"Very interesting introduction to philosophy -- MDR is an amazing professor and breaks down concepts comprehensibly and engagingly. I really enjoyed coming to class, even when the actual philosophy we were learning wasn't the most interesting. I would have loved to see philosophy from different cultural and religious traditions in the course -- I understand that this is a ""modern"" philosophy course, but having done a deep dive into Western modern philosophy makes me more interested in other philosophical traditions."
99136,"Strengths: MDR. He's one of the sweetest professors here. He's also a great lecturer and really engages you in the material. Weakness: there were many cog sci students in my discussion section (ig it's a required class for them) who were clearly not interested in it, and therefore the discussions were often lame."
99136,MDR is a great and engaging lecturer. He helped make complex concepts simple.
99136,Organized notes would be nice!
99136,lectures are excellent.
99136,"This course was recorded, which was very helpful because I was able to go back and review specific parts of each philosopher and help me gain a better understanding."
99136,"Most of MDR's lectures were super engaging and interesting, and I liked that even though it was a lecture, students could still ask questions. I also appreciated having discussion sections, but I personally found my TA to not be super helpful (this wasn't true for everyone though)."
99136,The course is well-designed and I learned a lot. Teachers are helpful and engagin.
99136,MDR's lectures are definitely a highlight of this course
99136,No weaknesses
99136,"The strengths include: very engaging and easy to understand lectures, fair workload, interesting content material   Weaknesses: not very engaging section"
99136,"I enjoyed learning about the views of a variety of philosophers, and lectures were excellent. The only weakness is that there are significant disparities in grading and expectations for participation across sections. Also, sections sometimes felt a bit rushed."
99136,"Strengths: papers were engaging Weaknesses: No lecture resources were posted such as notes or guides, made it difficult to catch up and follow along. Study of metaphysics and God primarily, was misled into thinking it was a broader philosophy course"
99136,"Lectures are very good, but section was disappointing -- our TA turned it into a mini-lecture again, which meant that we didn't get to discuss the concepts."
99136,Strengths - great lecturer weakness - would have been helpful to answer practice questions in class so we understood how to write a philosophy paper before writing our own
99136,"MDR is a great professor and engaging lecturer, the content is well chosen, and the course is well organized"
99136,"I think that although the class moved a little too quickly, it was still great and we got to cover a lot of material."
99136,"Strengths recorded lectures, GREAT professor, interesting class, fair level of difficulty  Weaknesses discrepancies in difficulties of different sections due to different TFs. Some TFs seemed to grade a lot harder than others"
99136,"This is an excellent course. It was structured in an accessible, challenging, and interesting format. I would not change anything about the course."
99136,"This course is great for anyone who does not know much about philosophy or is trying to get into philosophy. If you do have prior experience, it is enlightening to learn more about these philosophers' standpoints."
99136,"This course is outstanding. The content is fascinating, the professor and TFs are incredible philosophers and unusually accessible outside of class, and the course certainly forces you to level up your thinking skills.  My only critiques are that I wish we examined Kant's philosophy more closely at the end of the course and received additional clarity and a few samples on the paper expectations beforehand."
99136,"Strengths: The structure of the class was very consistent, we spent a good amount of time on each philosopher, and the lectures were very engaging and clarifying. The encouragement of questions in lecture was very fulfilling. I feel like I learned exactly what the syllabus said I would, and I learned it with much meaning and permanence (which can't be said for other courses!)  Can't think of any weaknesses, besides the fact that the final grade is based on two papers, one final exam, and participation. This system is quite popular in Yale courses, so this is understandable."
99136,"strengths -- great TAs, interesting lectures (MDR is a great professor and readily enthusiastic to talk during office hours/after class); weaknesses -- Kant felt rushed and time spent on different philosophers varied widely"
99136,"Organized, great professor and TAs. Lecture style is engaging."
99136,"Strengths: Professor Della Rocca is a wonderful lecturer and makes the connections between philosophical systems very clear, as well as the philosophical systems themselves, which is particularly impressive because the readings can be nearly unintelligible sometimes (*cough cough* Kant). My TF was incredible in terms of feedback and diagnosing issues in my essays, and essays were returned sooner than I expected based on previous classes.  Weaknesses: Although I love the selection of philosophers/readings especially because of the connections MDR makes between them and the sense of direction we get from the sequence, I do think we spent too little time on the few women philosophers who were on the syllabus. I could easily imagine a world in which even just one or two additional lectures on, say, Du Chtelet would have done so much more justice to said philosopher without sacrificing that much material on other philosophers that got several lectures, like Descartes or Leibniz. (I will say, though, that I doubt this is a bias thing; I would instead attribute it mainly to time/schedule issuesKant got very little lecture time tooand amount of reading available from each philosopher. But I still think more could have been said on Du Chtelet at least)."
99136,I think MDR was a very engaging and good professor. My section leader Angela was also very helpful and cleared confusion I may have about the material.
99136,This course is amazing in every way (and I do mean in every way) except for the disparity in grading for the TFs. There needs to be a greater establishment of the standards such that they can be applied uniformly.
99136,"The strength of this course would be the Professor, MDR is a really great professor even if he is kind of wasted on the class because it just asks you to regurgitate information. I don't feel like Im a better philosopher after the class but I do feel like I am more well versed in the a few early modern philosophers."
99136,"Strengths: MDR is an excellent lecturer. His lectures were always engaging and clear, and I got way more from attending lecture than I would have if I had only done the readings. The readings struck a good balance between being long enough to get a sense of what the philosopher was saying, and short enough to be quite manageable each week. The workload is not too bad: two 5-6 page papers and a final exam.  Weaknesses: I personally didn't find the material as exciting as I'd hoped in the first half of the semester, but it got better in the second half as we got to do more comparisons between philosophers. Throughout, it helped that MDR's lectures were always good."
99136,"Th course had very interesting lectures was able to cover a lot of material very fast. However, the courses were often a repeat of the week's readings."
99136,My discussion section could have been better organized. The lectures were engaging.
99136,I think the strengths are that Professor Della Rocca is very passionate about philosophy and loves what he is talking about which makes class more interesting. I also think the TAs are very helpful but the format of the class is the same every day so it can get monotonous and hard to continue to pay attention and stay engaged. There were also only two assignments and a final so there were not many opportunities to receive feedback to be able to improve more so I feel like more assignments that were smaller would help make sure everyone is understanding everything.
99136,"The strengths are the professor (Prof. Della Rocca is excellent) and the TFs, all of which are incredibly knowledgable and committed to helping their students. The only downside of the course is that the readings are often very dense and difficult to decode, but of course this is a necessary feature of studying modern philosophy and bespeaks no shortcoming of the course itself."
99136,The course is very interesting and taught well. A weakness is that sometimes the concepts are very hard to grasp and we go through them very fast.
99145,unnecessarily harsh grading.
99145,I think we all got a little bit lost by the second half of the course. Maybe it could be improved by not confusing the heck out of us.
99145,"Strengths: my TF (Michael) was amazing at facilitating discussion in section and for giving feedback on papers. He was the most helpful person. You learn how to structure an ethics paper and to think philosophically. Professor Kagan is incredibly intelligent and an engaging lecturer. Weaknesses: you're graded on improvement. I worked really hard the whole semester to do well, did every reading, had an A in section participation, got a decent grade on the first paper, but did worse on the 2nd paper which lowered my chances of an A. I ended up Cr/D/failing but still learned a lot throughout the semester. So while I have no regrets about the effort I put in the course, I do feel like the philosophy of grading on improvement doesn't actually reward students as effectively as it is believed."
99145,Strengths: Shelly is a very clear lecturer and breaks down complex readings into intelligible theories Weaknesses: there's a big range in engagement in sections
99145,very engaging--everyone was able to participate in lectures to get a consensus of people's thoughts about certain hypotheticals. I enjoyed the specific conversations that we had
99145,Strengths: Shelly is really fun to listen to and his lectures are always super engaging. Weaknesses: grading can feel harsh but it's really because the material is difficult
99145,"Strength: listen, Shelly knows what he's talking about. He made us test a lot of abstract concepts with very tangible examples, and I think that's probably the best way to do it. Weaknesses:  1.) Please give us an outline at the start of class. Half of the time, I had no idea what I was supposed to be taking notes on. Was something a tangent or the main idea? Is this a key example we're going to spend all of class on? How would you define this term? I never knew. Literally, a single slide with a numbered list and sub-bullets would work wonders. 2.) The lack of correlation between lecture, section, and readings. It's really hard to be a busy little Yalie and motivate to do the readings and you know there is zero incentive to do them. I didn't do a reading after week 2 (I wanted to, I swear, but I was busy), and I don't think I missed any conceptual stuff.  3.) Stop clinging to the grading curve of the Yale blue book. It just discourages people from caring about your class by incentivizing taking it Credit/D/F and doing the bare minimum. Also, all the TAs giving out unnecessarily low section grades at the first check-in just to turn section into a bloodbath felt gratuitous."
99145,"Lectures can be hit or miss. Personally I loved my TA, so section was always awesome. However, lectures, reading, and section are essentially never all on the same sequence, so most weeks you'll find yourself jumbling between topics, which can get a little confusing."
99145,"First and foremost, Shelly is a legendary lecturer. Everyone knows that. He doesn't disappoint. He's the best lecturer that I've ever seen and the best lecturer that I'll ever have. He's also very accessible to the students in his course. He's quite humble, too; I was reading the other day that he's somewhat famous in Korea. Who knew?  The course seldom directly addressed the assigned readings in either the lecture or the discussion sections, which sadly caused some less-motivated studentsmyself includedto stop doing the readings (sorry, Shelly!). This is actually quite regrettable in retrospect because if I could've found the motivation to do them, they would've been very beneficialboth in terms of the course and my performance on the papers and my broader intellectual development.  It's widely understood that the grading standards in this course are tougher than for any other course. That is truealthough possibly confounded by the fact that many students take the course Credit/D/Fail and are less motivated to put meaningful effort into their papers. For instance, I received B+ on my first two papers (I don't know about the last one) but only really spent 23 hours on each of them, whereas a philosophical paper merits far more time than that. What's perhaps less discussed is that the standards for section participation are also higher than other courses. This makes the sections an unpleasant experience for the introverted and shy folks among us. The sections were, in any case, quite enlightening; I still chose to sit through mine (largely without participating) even though I Credit/D/Failed the class and didn't need to be there based my paper grades."
99145,shelly is a great lecturer
99145,This class is truly wonderful and prioritizes learning and growth.
99145,Interesting but very harsh grading
99145,"Shelly's lectures are among the best lectures I've ever had at Yale, and I'm a second semester senior. He makes an active effort to involve and include the students in his lectures, for example by polling them on their ethical intuitions. Shelly also always stays after class to talk to students and answer individual questions, and I had a number of interesting conversations with him this way. The students in the course also tend to be very engaged, making for a great section.  I wish there were more contemporary readings assigned, particularly shorter papers that were roughly of the style we were expected to write papers in."
99145,Honestly a great class. Would have been helpful to have more standardization of class materials across sections.
99145,"Strengths: TFs are very kind, discussion sometimes interesting Weaknesses: Shelley is not a good teacher"
99145,I wish discussion sections were based more off of readings and focused on how we could write our papers.
99145,"Nothing to be improved, it was a wonderful course"
99145,"I really wish there had been more guidance with how to navigate writing philosophy papers. I also feel like the readings we were doing didn't always match up with what we were discussing in lecture or section that week. I think sections are the biggest strength of the class. However, we weren't really ever given feedback on what we were said during section, so it was hard to figure out what kind of logic was ""wrong"" until getting back our paper grades. I think the course could be improved by more teaching during section rather than it being a facilitated discussion among students."
99145,Kagan is a good lecturer. The readings are also a decent length and do overlap well with what is covered in class. Participating a lot in section can be annoying but as long as you show up and pay attention in class you'll be able to speak/ follow along. The grading can also be harsh but as long as you run your outline by your TF you'll be fine.
99145,"Strengths are the weekly discussion sections and the paper assignments, which helped me learn and become a better thinker. It could be improved by making the lectures more engaging -- maybe with some handouts or writing on a blackboard, or more interactive where students can share ideas."
99145,Good overall
99145,Lectures are entertaining and easy to follow. Discussion sections are useful for thinking through challenging ideologies. Structure of submitting and working on paper is poor as discussion section leaders are not always paper graders. TAs not very helpful.
99145,"Pretty standard course with a lecture and discussion section. Discussion sections were well organized and relevant to lecture material. The topics covered were pretty broad and some lectures only seemed to scratch the surface of the topics at hand, but were always useful and informative."
99145,"Shelly is a great lecturer and super interesting. I would recommend just recording them on your phone and taking notes after class so you can fully engage with some of the cool ideas and hypotheticals he talks to. Section is hit or miss, so maybe generalizing those more would be good. Grading also tough"
99145,"Prof Kagan is a wonderful orator, however, I often found the path of his arguments difficult to follow. For an introductory course, it would serve better to lay out the foundation clearly before diving into hypotheticals, as in ethical egoism says this... (There was some of this, but there could have been more). Additionally, the last class left me feeling confused about the purpose of the course."
99145,I feel like the course discourages learning because Shelly tells you at the start that you arent as smart as you think and doing well will be hard. I know my friends and I put our all in papers just to be told that it is because of the grading system that it isnt reflected in our grades. This makes it hard to put in effort when the professor tells you its almost impossible. It is also hard when others have written philosophy papers before and you are being compared to them. I think the entire class needs to be restructured to actually teach ethics without such high stakes.
99145,Variability between sections is high
99145,"I think Shellys lectures do a good job of engaging us as he walks through each of the theories we discuss, and I really relished the opportunity to talk through these issues with my peers in section. I also appreciated the fact that readings werent too long, so we could focus on absorption rather than page turning. My one suggestion is that we get more guidance on what Shellys looking for in a philosophy paper earlier on (perhaps with a sample paper), since I really didnt know what was expected until one of my friends sent me a sample A paper before the second paper. I also think theres a lot of variability between TFs in terms of guidance and feedback (Daigle seemed like she provided a lot more)."
99145,"course outlined well, but grading is too harsh"
99145,"I think the lectures are engaging and there is support when writing your essays! I wish there was more support for the discussion sections, especially for students who may not feel comfortable speaking at first."
99145,"Strengths: Lectures were very engaging, TFs helped a lot with papers, and the content was very interesting.  Weaknesses: there were a lot of discrepancies with how TFs operate with their students. I had a great TF who was willing to meet with me a lot on papers with individual meetings, some TFs held writing workshops for their students, and other TFs barely helped their students during meetings. I appreciate that TFs can choose how they want to help their students, but it is difficult for others to succeed for those that have TFs that aren't as supportive as others."
99145,"I thought that everything about the course was strong. Shelly Kagan is a phenomenal lecturer and turned some rather dry material into a really compelling lecture day in and day out. The workload was manageable, and with the help of the TFs and Kagan, the work itself was also perfectly accessible. I thought that there was a great balance of depth and understanding. For example, none of the paper prompts were overly complex by themselves, but they allowed for a lot of interpretations and incited a lot of thinking without getting us bogged down in trivial details. All in all a great class and one I'd recommend to anybody."
99145,"Strengths: lectures are very interesting Weaknesses: Sections feel like such a pressurized environment that it's hard to actually learn rather than just focus on getting a good grade. I feel as though if section wasn't graded so harshly, it would be easier to actually listen to my classmates' thoughts, rather than simply sit there hearing them in the background as I think of something to say."
99145,"The strengths are very interesting lectures and engaging TFs! Shelly is a great lecturer who always involves real world applications to make abstract subjects very tangible. One of the downsides is that the readings are rarely brought into lecture or section, so it kind of makes them pointless. Another is the horrendous grading policy. The majority of people get Bs while only a few select will get As, so it makes the class very hard to do well in. I think a more traditional grading policy would sway less people away from taking the class because the topics are essential to forming a strong personal ethical system."
99145,"It doesn't make sense to me that readings, lecture, and section aren't even supposed to cover the same material/work together. I also think that while Shelly is a great lecturer, a little bit more organization or an outline for lecture would help me understand the material better."
99145,"The lectures from Professor Kagan where very engaging and thought provoking. However, the class feel less enjoyable when it asks students to write their own papers. There are not example essays provided and the TAs are not allowed to look at rough drafts to see if you are heading in the right direction. Ultimately throughout my time I felt like was set up to fail my first paper. Professor Kagan does provide a sheet on what an ethics paper should be. But the sheet is more of how an ethics paper should be organized and its way to long to the point were by the time one reads it they forget the point of the sheet. Ultimately, when writing papers students are largely abandoned. I do not think the class is ""difficult"" rather the class leaves students alone to figure things out. While this is enjoyable when it comes to thinking about one's opinions, it's not enjoyable when it comes to writing papers which are basically how you get your grade. I felt even now at the end of the course I do not know what a good philosophy paper is or what makes a philosophical argument good. The papers therefore were extremely stressful and for an introductory course somewhat harmful to my views on taking more ethics courses in the future. There should be more writing support not just 30mins with a TA where most of the time will be spent just wrapping your head around the prompt. E"
99145,"Lectures are brilliant, Shelly Kagan is the best lecturer I have had at Yale (albeit this is only my second semester). However, there is major discrepancy across grading papers and evaluating section performance depending on the TA."
99145,It was a good course and if you are engaged with the material and meet with your TA it makes the learning experience better.
99145,"lectures are awesome, section could be more helpful in terms of learning how to adequately write papers"
99145,"The mixture of lecturing and discussion section was a great system to teach new ideas and then review them and allow for questions and practice. Although we did get useful handouts outlining the theories discussed in class, which was very helpful in the essay writing process, having a source on canvas to go over the key points of lecture might also help with review and essay writing."
99145,"Strengths: Shelly is the best lecturer I have ever had. It was truly a pleasure to go to class. Every lecture was very well organized and was always engaging. The readings were of a reasonable length. I loved that Shelly was willing to answer so many questions after class. It was helpful for getting things clarified, and it was fun to think more about what was discussed in class. Weakness: A lot of the readings (particularly Mill and Kant) were really hard to understand, as they were supposed to be. But I think I got really bogged down in definitions (such as a priori), so I wish I had some sort of additional aid (like an introductory essay that would have helped better understand the readings) so I could focus my attention on the philosophical argument instead of on deciphering the text. Often the reading became easier after Shelly's lectures, since he explained the arguments in a much more accessible way."
99145,"Strengths - no exams  weaknesses - super harsh grading, not very engaging, sections are not enjoyable and require much participation, if you participate in section 5-6 times in 50 minutes you get a B, not an accommodating class"
99145,I wish the course had more written out and hand out materials. Sometimes I was lost in my notes because the professor spoke fast. With such hard material it would help to have more handouts for the very basics.
99145,"This course is difficult, which is odd for being an introductory course. The standards need to change in order to be improved. Nonetheless, the content itself is great and at times can be intellectually engaging."
99145,"A strength is definitely Shellys lectures. Shelly is a fantastic lecturer, both because he is extremely animated and because he is very skilled at using examples to illustrate concepts clearly.   I also really appreciated how Shelly made himself available to the students in the class. He always welcomed questions during or after lecture and offered for students to meet with him outside of class, which I did twice hes not one of those famous professors who says hell meet with his students and doesnt, he actually follows through, and I really appreciated that.   Section was a strength as well. I had a really incredible TF, more on her later, but section was structured to be extremely interactive and I thought it did a really solid job reinforcing the material from lecture.   The main weakness, one that youve probably heard about but nonetheless holds, is the grading. I get where Shelly comes from on this: yes, grade inflation is very much a thing (https://www.gradeinflation.com/) and I understand that as a professor he has the right to curve the class however he wants to. (If anything, he probably gets worse reviews for insisting on the harsh grading, so I have respect for his conviction here.)   That said, prepare yourself: The papers are graded very harshly. A mere 15% of the class got an A or an A- on the first paper. Shelly insists that in the end, he rewards improvement and is somewhat nice with grades. But still, Im the type of person who cant help but be stressed by this sort of thing. Maybe the harsh grading made me work harder than I otherwise wouldve, but still, I would say it definitely impeded my ability to enjoy the class."
99200,"The modules could be more clear. Otherwise, I think Prof. Demers was a great teacher and I really enjoyed the course."
99200,I think this class is well structured. The weekly quizzes are fair and hold you accountable for going to lectures which are important for understanding the concepts. The tests were also a very fair representation of what we did in class and truly tested if we understood the material which I appreciate. I also think Professor Demer's is great at lecturing and following the pace of the students. I do not have any complaints.
99200,"The strength is Sarah Demers. She worries so much about her students, it is so clear that learning is at the center of her goals. She emphasizes this throughout the semester, and is clear in all her practices, continuously asking for student feedback. Her grading policies are awesome, allowing to gain points back and learn by doing corrections in the midterms. The only weakness is that sometimes the psets are not doable with the content we learned in class. I understand that they are an opportunity to take concepts to an extra level, but I think at times, in the psets, we were working on things that had nothing to do with what he had talked about in class. I appreciated the problems that were hard but on concepts we had talked aboutwith enough effort and time you can do it, unlike some other questions that the TAs just had to give you the answer (for example problems requiring Taylor series, which we were not expected to know or understand but still was part of some problems). This is a minor weakness, however. The class is awesome and Sarah is the best professor ever!"
99200,more practice not from textbook modules
99200,"The course is the same workload each week and is taught in an engaging way. I wish the course moved a little quicker, lecture would get bogged down with student questions quite frequently, which often could have been answered after class individually."
99200,The psets are very difficult but they provide a lot of help in study hall. The practice psets for exams are super helpful.
99200,"pretty well organized, sometimes felt like the time spent in class was wasted on things we weren't tested on"
99200,"Strengths: Professor Demers, amazing TA's (who were also comfortingly and encouragingly diverse in experiences and backgrounds), TRUE definition of a collaborative environment"
99200,"Strengths: Exams are straightforward if you do the review P-Set beforehand. There are in class quizzes, but they're always easy and there to just make sure that you're coming to class. Psets can be a little more challenging, but there are plenty of TA and prof office hours that provide help with Psets. Prof has a great personality and adds life to the class.  Weakness: Class is less reliant on math if you're into that. Prof can sometimes make lecture a little confusing, but this wasn't really a major issue."
99200,"Prof Demers and the TAs were incredible! Prof Demers has such enthusiasm when she lectures, and is more than happy to make time to help her students out. This was the most manageable, least stressful pre-med class, and was actually enjoyable for someone who previously did not like physics"
99200,"Strengths are the community feel of the classroom. Since it's not graded on a curve, you feel that you can ask your peers for help and they will help you. The office hours and TAs are also a huge strength."
99200,"I found a large disconnect between lectures, problem sets, and exams. I felt like the lectures consisted a lot of proofs of equations, problem sets did not follow lectures or what was covered in the textbook modules, and then exam questions didn't correspond at all to problem set questions."
99200,The course was incredibly well-structured to allow for student learning. Having study halls and weekly quizzes made learning accesible and Prof. Demers was incredibly accommodating. Prof. Demers was a delightful instructor whom was heavily invested in breaking concepts down so as to ensure our learning. She made the class amazing.
99200,"Strengths: fair exams, fair grading system (grades determined through raw scores, no competition with other students), a lot of TA office hours/study halls, which are good for p sets   Weaknesses: Demers is sometimes overly excited about the material and doesn't explain stuff well during lecture. She is good at clarification though, so just ask during office hours or after class"
99200,"Strength is the Professor, study halls, and constant office hours. Weakness is the length of the psets, but I've heard the 181 psets are even worse."
99200,"Strengths: Professor Demers! She is very understanding and caring, and she does an excellent job of explaining the material in an accessible way. The grading system in this class is very fair. Weaknesses: Not too manyI thought psets did not really reflect what we were supposed to know for exams, and while psets were sometimes arduous, I think the fact that they were difficult helped me solidify the material. I really appreciated when Professor Demers cut down on the number of questions assigned per pset halfway through the semester because it gave me the time to fully understand the problems I was doing, rather than sitting passively in office hours and trying to jot down everything without fully comprehending what I was writing."
99200,"Strengths: Kind/helpful instructor. Fun in-class demonstrations. Fair problem sets and exams. Well-written course modules.  Weaknesses: Poorly taught. Material was covered at a snail's pace, with elementary concepts (i.e. how to compute a dot product) often taking up entire class periods. There was no value to showing up to class, as everything covered could be learned better & more quickly just by reading the course text/modules."
99200,"I did not enjoy the course modules that were adjacent to this course, as I think they were poorly designed and did not align well with the lectures (which I really enjoyed)."
99200,Great structure and opportunities for grade improvement
99200,I really liked the connection of physics concepts to physiology as well as the demonstrations in class. The PSETs however sometimes felt very disconnected from what we learned in class.
99200,"Strong course. Content was well taught, textbook was clear, many office hours with helpful TAs."
99200,Awesome
99200,"strengths: there are many components to the final grade and therefore many opportunities to learn, the midterm examinations are a fair assessment of our knowledge of the content and we are given corrections, there are many resources such as office hours, study halls, and peer tutors  weaknesses: the problem sets are quite difficult and time consuming but manageable with office hours and study halls"
99200,Great course!
99200,The teacher was incredibly helpful and made the coarse approachable to those not comfortable with physics
99200,"The strength of this course is the number of office hours and the support that the course provides. From the resources from TAs and other students, I was able to truly dive into the PSETs and work alongside peers and TAs to better and deepen my understanding of physics concepts. I believe that the review material was very helpful and guided me toward being successful on the exams, and the quizzes were also another wonderful tool to keep me on track with the course as well as provide additional study material for the exam. Overall, I believe the resources provided in this class were very helpful in ensuring that students do well. A weakness of the course would sometimes me the disconnect between homework and exams. I thought that the PSETs sometimes were a lot harder than the exam and the questions were also pretty different, but the review PSET was perfect."
99200,"I think one big strength was that they had a lot of TA's who were willing to meet outside of their office hours, but one weakness is that problem sets sometimes did not match up with lecture and/or exams"
99200,Strengths: good teaching team and professor. The best premed requirement I took at Yale.
99200,A great amount of work
99200,"The strengths of the course were the teaching team and Professor Demers. Although typically larger lecture courses are a bit disorganized and frustrating at times, I felt that Dr. Demers listened to our feedback and adjusted, which is something I appreciated throughout the semester. She offered review sessions that were extremely helpful and facilitated our understanding of the material. Weaknesses would be the timing of certain review sessions, but Dr. Demers did her absolute best to accommodate. Another weakness would be that there is a very large amount of students and it was difficult to get help during study halls, so if possible, maybe adding more TAs would be an improvement, but I know the teaching team tried very hard to adjust."
99200,"Strengths Prof Demers is truly an angel. She is an incredible human being whose dedication to helping us learn was visible in the very supportive class culture.  Weaknesses at times, it felt like we were doing haphazard module problems and just about scratching the surface of the material we were meant to get into."
99200,The modules used to instruct the course were unclear and poorly organized. One way to improve would be to use an existing textbook.
99200,Strengths are the professor and TAs - very helpful and supportive. Weaknesses are the difficulty of the PSETs and its inability to connect to the material and the class.
99200,Strength: Professor Demers! Shes such an incredible professor and is so understanding! She literally listens to student feedback on the class and makes changes to benefit us! I highly recommend this class to anyone because Professor Demers makes this Physics super fun and interesting in this class! Weakness: None
99200,Amazing course! So fun and really encourages learning! I feel like I was very invested in the material and learned so much!
99200,Good lectures and tests of knowledge. Psets were fairly difficult.
99200,The Psets take far too long compared to their relevance in the exams
99200,"The strengths of this course is that it really facilitates learning! The structure of lecture with the weekly quizzes allowed me to keep up with if I knew the material! I also thought that the psets were well suited for keeping up with learning because we are able to understand the pset material with the TAs and office hours. I thought the exams were also really well structured and very fair which I really appreciated. No improvements, course was good!"
99200,Strengths is that it is taught very well and in a great way. Psets are really hard so you will need to work in groups or with a TA. Then tests are more manageable as they test if you have gotten the material that you are actually expected to learn for our math level
99200,"This course was well paced and had many resources that allowed for student success. The teaching team was great, and professor Demers was amazing!"
99200,The professor needs to respond to emails its so difficult to communicate with teaching staff
99200,Prof. Demers really cares about her students and does her best to make sure you are understanding the material
99200,Strengths: Professor Demers is incredible!!
99200,"Great course, but more difficult examples during class to help as a reference for problem sets would be amazing."
99200,Strengths: The professor is a gem. Very kind and helpful. Works hard to ensure that the class is fairly structured. Weaknesses: The overlap between the lectures and psets is questionable at times.
99200,The problem sets are not useful for exams at all. The modules are also not useful at all. The questions are not similar and the information from the module is not easily intelligible. Make up problems for psets instead of using the module ones.
99200,"STRENGTHS: Sarah Demers is quite possibly a goddess walking the Earth. She is a great instructor who is supremely intelligent but also kind, warm, and down to Earth. You can tell that she loves physics and she is excited to share that knowledge with us. She makes asking questions (even in a huge lecture hall) not scary and explains things at a clear and interesting pace. Exams were very fair, and her class demonstrates that you can learn a lot (you end up with a great conceptual knowledge of physics) without being stressed, overwhelmed, or on the brink of crying every time you try to do a p'set or take an exam (*cough cough phys180*). Weekly quizzes are helpful and she definitely reads the survey questions, so it's easy to give feedback and students feel seen and cared for. WEAKNESSES: none!"
99200,"This course is amazing!! The strength is Professor Demers. She is the best. I also like how the exams were truly testing the fundamental concepts and if you had a solid understanding you were totally fine. The problem sets were sometimes a bit long and you had to go to office hours or study hall to finish them, but I thought it was actually fun and encouraged a good learning environment."
99200,"The course was well set up for your classic pre-requisite intro class. The biggest weakness was the textbook which is a bit confusing, not very well organized and felt difficult to understand. As the material was built on the textbook, it was sometimes difficult to understand the material."
99200,"Prof Demers is such an enthusiastic and engaging teacher!! Loved going to class, but didn't always feel like the psets and materials necessarily prepared us for exams or lined up with lecture material."
99200,"I thought this course was really great at managing expectations. Each student knew what material to study, and how to do well in the course. This does not mean that there was a lack of material. Problem sets were really tough, but in a way that made growth possible. It's hard to think of a way this course can be improved. Maybe you can host more office hours?"
99200,Lectures were very well structured and covered all the materail well. The class just moved very slowly and the modules were riddled with typos and not that helpful to read from.
99201,"This course could not be improved. It is wonderful as-is. The harder PSETs allow deep engagement with the material, and there is SO much wonderful support in this course, lead by Professor Steinacker, TAs, and peer tutors!"
99201,"This course explored many difficult-to-grasp concepts that made it hard at times to remain interested, but the community of peers in the class made it much easier to easily digest the material. I think this course definitely needs more teaching fellows for office hours, as it became difficult at times to get assistance from only the professor."
99201,"Strengths: Professor is very nice, supportive, and good at explaining dense concepts. Problem sets and exams were manageable, and helped improve my understanding of the concepts from in class. The TF/peer tutor team was also very helpful during office hours. Weaknesses: None that stood out."
99201,"Strengths: Professor Steinacker's homework always did a great job of testing my understanding of the material. I always felt like I learned the material again from the problem sets, which I believe is the goal. I also appreciated that she decreased the number of required questions this semester, as it helped me spend more time actually understanding the problems instead of rushing to finish all of them. Study hall was also extremely useful, especially because I could not attend Professor Steinacker's office hours. Lectures are also another joy--Professor Steinacker knew us all after last semester, so class was a lot more relaxed and fun, and she is such a kind-hearted, good-humored soul.  Weaknesses: None! This course was more difficult than PHYS 180, but better taught and more enjoyable to me!"
99201,"This course is clearly designed over years of work and it shows. It is well designed at getting students to understand concepts in physics, at least as presented by Prof Steinacker. As long as TAs and ULAs continue to be supported to support this class, it is excellent"
99201,"I genuinely cannot think of weaknesses of the course; it is exceedingly well organized and formatted to optimize student learning both in and out of the classroom, between the work that Prof. Steinacker does to organize her lectures and the 10+ office hours that are available for students to attend if they have questions."
99201,Potentially adding optional section could be helpful for the course?
99201,"The strengths of this course is how well taught it is, but its weakness is how time consuming the workload can be but it's understandable when you need to learn so much content."
99201,"This course is yet another Prof. Steinacker SLAY. Hands down one of the best professors at this university, especially in stem."
99201,"This course is one of the best courses I have ever taken, the professor makes the content very engaging and is very patient with all her students during office hours if there are any unanswered questions. The materials are ordered well, with the PSETs graded before each midterm and the final. Also, at least 2 review sessions are held for everybody before the exams."
99201,-Steiny is a clear strength -very well organized and tons of resources -midterms not worth a lot but homeworks are
99201,"If a student goes to every lecture, reads the review notes after that lecture, and still cannot correctly answer a single question on a problem set, something needs to change. I found this course ridiculously time intensive and difficult for a prerequisite, introductory physics course. I understand that a grade distribution has to be established, but what I don't understand, is why this class took so much time away from the classes in my actual major. It just simply is not necessary. The lectures are great! The lecture notes are fantastic! But the problem sets suck! Some potential improvements include: limiting the number of pset problems to 3-5 a week; writing problems that start easy and are just an application of lecture notes, then increasing the difficulty in later problems."
99201,"This is one of the best courses I've taken. Along with 180 I've learned more about physics that I would have I think in any other introductory physics course. It is so logically taught and it is evident that Steinacker created, honed, and breathed life into this course. I came into sophomore year hating physics, even into 181 not liking it very much. I hit a point in this semester when I realized I had become good at it, and I actually enjoyed being able to do the problems. I did not think this was possible. Yes the course is difficult. 180 kicked my ass. But I also learned a lot, and with enough effort improvement is inevitable. I think its also graded fairly as the homework is worth the most, and the midterms are worth relatively little and corrections are offered. The only way I think the course would be improved is to get rid of the in class participation questions or not weight them as heavily. I don't feel like students should be penalized through their grade for not making it to a lecture, but I understand she wants high attendance."
99201,great Professor. No complaints this semester!
99201,Well done course. Lots of out of class opportunities and ways to get a good grade.
99201,"Strengths: Adriane. Steinacker. That's it. She makes this course what it is, and she does a fantastic job at doing it. I think the course is very well organized and has a nice flow of information, and the peer tutors are very helpful during office hours to help solve homework problems and resolve general content questions.  Weaknesses: The homeworks are lengthy and difficult, but it's worth it in the end to get a good grasp on problem-solving. I think the only weakness I can think of is that the teaching fellows aren't as helpful as the peer tutors, and can sometimes even be a little bit condescending when it comes to explaining stuff, but that's not a norm. Generally have had better help coming from undergraduate students."
99201,The problem sets are very lengthy and it is rare to complete them without going to several office hours.
99201,"The lectures could be confusing, but the professor is so sweet and the lecture notes she posts afterwards are so helpful that it never really becomes an issue."
99201,"Strengths: Instructor is very engaged with students, lots of available office hours and support for the psets  Weaknesses: It would be nice if the course made it clearer which point in the course would be on the final or not."
99201,"The course is great as Prof. Steinacker is engaging, excited about the material, and good at explaining. It is hard, however, to stay focused when she just does problems on the board. I know there are time restaints but I think the class can gain a lot if we worked with the people next to us more often on solving a problem ourselves before we go over it as a class. I know that this is what the PSETS are for, but I find myself often just copying down what she writes on the board without understanding it"
99201,"This is an absolutely phenomenal course; the teaching team is so passionate, and Professor Steinacker is an incredible instructor and person. The class has really evolved from prior years in a positive direction (for instance, having 4 mandatory p-set problems instead of 5-6). This evolution has been a great strength of the course in making it more accessible and manageable while still keeping the challenge and value that come from engaging with physics."
99201,"The course is very well organized and I received help or guidance almost every day! At the end of the semester, I felt that I learned so much and had a great time engaging with the discussed topics. We had many office hours and sessions that may further help the students review once again, more in detail, the concepts discussed during the lectures, or work in teams on ideas for the problems on the assignments, or simply discuss interesting topics in classical and modern Physics. All the problem sets tested rigorously the understating of the material and developed my creativity in finding a solution to a problem."
99201,"The time is taken to explain concepts thoroughly, and she goes through complicated examples so that you can see how they are applied. Lowkey, there is no way this class could be improved."
99201,"Strengths: Lecture is pretty well taught, and the lecture notes are helpful. Weaknesses: Not much additional support for preparing for exams."
99201,"Lectures are sometimes hard to follow, but the office hours help solidify any topics that you may have issues with"
99201,"I think the greatest strength of this course is the ample support that is offered. Office hours are held Monday-Friday for 2-3 hours, and additional study hall sessions are offered by peer tutors during five evenings of the week."
99201,I thought the course was incredibly strong in total. I found that the rigor of the psets properly prepared me for the exams and did a good job of cementing the information.
99201,This course was very challenging. The psets were very hard and it pushed me to understand the intricacies of physics. The workload was very high and a lot of time had to be spent outside of class.
99201,It was too advanced for general physics. I won't need half of this in my further studies. There is an advanced physics course for this type of physics.
99201,"I really enjoyed this course. Professor Steinacker cares a lot about each student and does everything possible to ensure that her students succeed in the course. There are a lot of opportunities to attend office hours and study hall, and the exams (although challenging) are very fair."
99201,"Strengths: This course was taught very passionately and in much computational detail. I love the insistence on really focusing on a problem, working through it, and using it as a tool for learning. This sort of deep learning through problem solving was thoroughly impressed upon me from this class. Additionally, the frequency of office hours and peer tutoring was phenomenally helpful. I loved the emphasis on collaboration with classmates. The lectures were also taught with such passion, and while there was significant time spent computing and proving the origin of certain equations, the rst of the time was spent in productive marvel at the beauty and mysteriousness of the physics.  Weaknesses: The arrangement of the concepts was sometimes a little unclear. For example, before transitioning from ""finding the magnetic field due to some particular object"", to ""finding the magnetic force of some object on another"" (from force to field), it would have been helpful for the distinction between those two topics to be verbalized simply and clearly (just to help students compartmentalize and process as they learn). Without this, some new topics or specific equations could feel a bit 'random' at times. And when content feels random, it immediately becomes more intimidating, uninteresting, and ""out of reach""."
99201,Professor Steinacker is the greatest stength of this class. She is fabulous and such a great professor. Her lectures are engaging and fun and she is so helpful in office hours. Another strength is that psets are worth a lot of the grade and you can get them checked in office hours also you can get half of your points back with revisions on the exams.
99201,"Professor Steinacker is a very caring teacher who wants her students to do well and learn a lot. She went a little easier on us this semester with problem sets, but I had a harder time learning the material this time compared to mechanics."
99201,This course benefited from the ample study hall and office hours opportunities. I greatly appreciated that I could always go somewhere for help.
99201,Strengths : office hours and homework!!!
99201,"Strengths: So so interesting!! Loved this class, very organized and lots of resources for help."
99201,"My only qualm would be that the lectures are often too fast-paced for me to keep up, especially when a lot of new material is presented in weeks when there are exams."
99201,"Strengths: Adriane Steinacker is an incredible professor. She expects a lot from us, but she provides us the support to achieve a lot. I appreciate how available her office hours and study halls are. She is a great lecturer.  Weaknesses: It's a tough course, but that is natural for the subject matter."
99201,Great visual demonstrations.
99201,"Strengths: Professor Steinacker!! She is the kindest, most caring professor I have ever had at Yale. She is an amazing and engaging lecturer and is extremely accommodating. The class is also very well-organized with detailed notes posted after each lecture. I didn't always follow what was happening during the lectures, but reading the notes on Canvas really helped my understanding. As someone who had never taken a single physics class before and last took calc 3+ years ago, Steinacker provides all the information you need to succeed in this class. There is also a TON of support throughout the semester- office hours offered almost every day of the week, study halls at night, etc. The PSETs are hard, but if you attend office hours or study halls they are completely doable. I left the class feeling like I had truly learned a lot and become a better student overall. You also have the option to do test corrections and get 50% of the points back on the midterms, which takes some stress off of them. Steinacker's review sessions were also really helpful.   Weaknesses: PSETs were difficult, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. They really test your knowledge of the material and help you practice the concepts. Classes went a bit fast and were at times hard to follow (but lecture notes are helpful when you need to catch up)."
99201,Great class! Professor Steinacker is wonderful and the class is structured very well.
99201,"Always people available to help you. Whether it be the peer tutors or professor herself, someone can always help."
99201,"The course is consistent in its homework and midterm strategies, which people get prepared for via Physics 180 in the fall semester."
99201,"Strengths: Attention to students via Professor, Study Halls, and Task"
99201,"Very well laid out, clear, and expectations are clear. The material is made incredibly accessible, it is easy to get help, and the tests are written well based on the class material. i really can't find any weaknesses."
99201,It would be good to have TFs on all night time study hall days rather than just the weekdays. I found them more helpful than peer tutors
99201,"I think that the plethora of office hours is the greatest strength of this course. The OH were amazing in that the TFs would always aid students, however I did find that these OH were less helpful than PHYS 180 OH. I also think that Professor Steinacker's problem sets this semester felt at times more difficult than in PHYS 180 but that could have been due to the fact that many students have a background in mechanics rather than E&M when entering college."
99201,"Professor Steinacker is incredible, and her office hours and the study halls are really helpful. The course is well organized, and the lecture notes and lecture videos are great. There aren't any weaknesses."
99201,lecture notes are solid
99201,"Taught well, a lot of material"
99202,"Strength: the professor. Prof. Steinacker is incredible. She is extremely passionate about the subject and conveys that in her lectures. Psets are challenging, but doable, and Prof. Steinacker and the TAs were so patient and helpful. Provides a very good overview of the material.  Weaknesses: psets could be time consuming, but that also may be the nature of the subject. Really appreciate the decrease in workload this semester compared to 180 last semester."
99202,"God I hate these psets, but without them I prob would not have learned anything. You might do bad on the exams but you still end up understanding the content somehow, and Steinacker curves the class so you should be fine with your grade"
99202,"Strengths- Grading criteria was fair and I thought the breakdown of grading was good.  Weaknesses- The classes were spend primarily deriving formulas and then the homework was based on using the formulas when we hadn't had examples causes everyone to struggle greatly on the problems and need TF and peer tutor help to complete the assignments. Additionally the homework was very long and took far more time then any other class I was taking. There is an extremely high workload of this course. The exams are difficult but the corrections on the midterms make it alright, the difficult aspect is the final is the same difficulty of problems but worth more of the grade and without revisions makes people's grades drop and I think the final should be curved."
99202,"good class, a requirement for most people"
99202,"I would say that this is one of the best science classes at Yale. Although the course is difficult, the course really helps develop a very strong and useful understanding of complex topics in E&M."
99202,"Professor Steinacker is an outstanding professor, and she provides so many resources for learning and understanding the material. She herself hosts at least 8 hours of office hours each week, and she's arranged TA/peer tutor office hours every night."
99202,"Physics 181 is by far better than 180. 180 had an almost unbearable workload and the material was not interesting, at least to me. 181 was way more engaging and moderate in workload. It was actually a pretty fun class and the fundamentals that I feel as though would be needed in my major were found in this course."
99202,"I would say the biggest strength of this course is Professor Steinacker; her lectures are incredibly engaging, and the way she structures her lectures and her lecture notes makes it very easy to grasp difficult concepts. Additionally, the wide array of options for office hours and study halls creates a really productive learning environment for working on problem sets."
99202,"Sometimes it does feel more like a (learn how to solve equations class, instead of understanding what is going on different situations"
99202,Strengths: A great breakdown of the material with a wonderful professor. OH was a great way to get help for assignments -- please go! Weaknesses: pretty high workload. not much feedback on homework assignments.
99202,"Prof Steinacker is an amazing professor and I really recommend this class! I really appreciate all the care she put into the class, and even if the course is difficult (on the HW), it is meant to push your understanding and help you grow as a thinker! And her exams and reviews are very very reasonable and fair! I think she does an outstanding and amazing job teacher! I am so glad I got to have her as my professor for physics!"
99202,"The course is difficult and you should expect to spend a lot of time in office hours to finish the psets. However, there are a lot of TFs and peer tutors available to help you. Professor Steinacker is fantastic and is very dedicated to her students. She does her best to make lectures interesting and help students out in any way possible. A weakness of the course is that sometimes TFs would badly grade the assignments and tests, taking points off when you should not be losing points."
99202,I liked that lecture notes were provided and recorded lectures were available. It would be helpful if all the recorded lectures were made available if someone missed a lecture or wanted to review it.
99202,"I found the PSETs pretty manageable as long as you went to office hours, which there are a lot of. The professor genuinely cares about her students. Exams are curved and there are exam corrections to get back points, which is nice. The only thing I wish is that they gave a formula sheet earlier so that you could use it on PSETs rather than just right before exams."
99202,"Strengths: This class gives a very organized and well-taught introduction to different electromagnetism concepts. It builds all of the information from a foundational level which helps not only know but, understand the reasoning behind everything. The lectures (and subsequent notes) are designed to take you through acquiring and applying knowledge. You are not just handed formulas or given complicated derivations to say you have them. Instead, they are walked through, questioned, and then comprehended, and finally used in physical examples (which facilitated a great learning environment). Problem Sets can be difficult at times, but with strong access to help during office hours and study halls, they are very manageable.   Weakness: Electromagnetism, at times, is not an intuitive sector of physics. As a result, even though the process of getting formulas or conclusions is clear, it can be hard to grasp ""what it physically means"". To improve, potentially add a couple more analogies that can help. (One example that was effective was using water flowing for an analogous example of electric flux)."
99202,"Strengths: Professor Steinacker makes this course what it is. She infuses her lectures with passion, always is available to help in office hours, and is very attentive to students. She is rigorous with her PSets and her work demands a lot, but you learn so much from the experience and leave the class with a lot of insight and knowledge on electromagnetism. The exams are very fairly graded, and the level of depth to which we go in each sub-topic is just right for them to tie together coherently. Lectures are some of the best and most organized I've been to at Yale. The lecture notes are also very comprehensive and detailed. Can't think of weaknesses."
99202,This course was taught really well. I honestly dont have any critiques.
99202,"The course is extremely challenging. And the problem sets present an exceptional time commitment, that essentially requires office hours to complete"
99202,Strength: great p-sets that prepared you well for the exams Weakness: lectures were not very engaging
99202,"Fantastic lecturer, great PSETs + office hours that are extremely conducive to learning, many resources for help (extra PSET problems, reviews, study halls, etc)"
99202,Prof. Steinacker is great and the course is very well structured
99202,"I think the beginning of this course went very well. I started feeling like I was struggling after the first midtermthe midterm made it hard to focus and really learn the material in a pivotal point in the course, and from then on I felt behind. I suppose this is natural in such a challenging class, and Im not sure how to get around it. The support network for this class is phenomenal. Professor Steinacker is super supportive, and the review sessions and study hall sessions and office hours were essential to understanding the material and succeeding."
99202,"The primary strengths of the course are the resources that Professor Steinacker provides you in order to comprehend thr material. In class, she will always work through the material step-by-step and will frequently encourage questions from students to engage them and depending on the lesson will have in-class demonstrations that are interesting to watch and learn from. Additionally, outside of class, there will office hours nearly everyday for a 2 hour period , peer tutoring/study hall for PSET at around the same frequency, just later in the day, and she will provide lecture notes on all classes. This becomes an amazing resource given that she does not quite follow the textbook and the notes are thorough, in-depth, and easy to understand. Lecture notes will truly be of unparalleled help if you are trying to study or comprehend the material if you didn't get it in class. Lastly, before any midterm of exam Professor Steinacker will provide the list of topics covered, the lectures containing those topics, hold a dedicated review session to which she will also upload the notes for (containing example problems and topics), and cite every PSET problem that relates to said topic in order to get practice with it. What can be improved from the course relates primarily to the management of PSETs. By her own admission, Professor Steinacker will make PSETs intentionally difficult in order to ""force"" you to attend office hours or peer tutoring. They are not meant to be solved independently which can be very hard to keep up with if other classes are also piling work. Also, the deadline for PSETs is rarely 11:59 and most often at 6pm on Fridays which can interfere with a lot of other work. This aspect of the homework is the greatest thing I had an issue with in her course."
99202,Strengths is that it's very in depth and the professor makes sure that you're learning and getting the most out of it. Weakness is that it's a bit fast paced and sometimes you'll need to play catch up on your own. Also homework can be a bit much at times.
99202,"The class is very well organized to support student learning, as there's always office hours or study halls to attend. Sometimes I wouldn't receive clear grading on my assignments, which made it more difficult to learn from my errors made."
99202,"Strengths: Adriane Steinacker is the biggest strength of this course. That woman is an ANGEL! She gets to know all of her students, is so kind and sweet, and has a deep love of what she teaches. Her office hours were the highlight of my week, and she made the class very manageable. The TA's and your peers in the class are also a large strength. Without working with others I would've failed this course.  Weaknesses: The content, being a physics class, is hard and you have to really work at it to understand it. But that's it! No other weaknesses :)"
99202,N/A I love this course and Steinacker is amazing.
99202,"181 was definitely better in terms of workload than 180 because Prof. Steinacker started giving us shorter problem sets which made the class overall just much less stressful. I love the way that exams are run; you get to do revisions after the exam, which I think is such a great learning opportunity in subjects like physics as you are able to go back after the exam and make sure that you really do know all the subject matter. Professor Steinacker is great at explaining the subject matter but be aware that it is definitely more abstract than first-semester physics, so in my opinion, it was much harder to keep up in lectures."
99202,"I learned a lot in this course, however, I don't think any course should have this much homework and stress."
99202,"Course material is interesting, however workload is a lot"
99202,"This is a fantastic course that sets up a strong foundation of physics thats perfect for people in related majors, but it may be challenging to premeds that are just taking it because its a pre req."
99202,I dont see any weaknesses with the course. It is very structured to get a lot from lecture and theirs is so much help offered outisde of class. I dont think theres a single office hour slot I at some point didnt go to.
99202,This is an absolutely fantastic course!  One strength is the problem sets (very well designed). Another is office hours Prof Steinacker and her peer tutors are great!
99202,"Just like PHYS 180, it is taught really well. The homework assignments can be a bit much at times, so you have to go to study hall or office hours to complete them."
99202,"I think that the course does a fine job teaching the topics it covers, the workload is fairly intense but other than that no points of improvement."
99202,"Did very well at utilizing skills built from PHYS 180, and just expanding new ways to apply knowledge."
99202,I really appreciate the constant feedback and the ability to do corrections in this class. It helps me learn from my mistakes and better my understanding of the material.
99202,"This class was wonderful! I could not have imagined a better introduction to these topics. Even though I never took AP Physics in high school, and hardly encountered electromagnetism topics prior to this course, Professor Steinacker made everything approachable by giving exciting lectures and providing an abundance of extra-help resources."
99202,The strengths of the class were the office hours were extremely helpful in consolidating the lectures and concepts went over in class. You also got to collaborate with others and check answers to check your understanding of the problems. The lectures were very well taught and Professor Steinacker is very supportive and understanding of her students.
99202,"Professor Steinacker is one of the most engaged and best professors I have had at Yale. She constantly strives to ensure students learn the material and actually understand what they are learning, and offers countless office hours each week so that students aren't just completing the problem sets, but understanding them at the same time."
99202,Its very hard and difficult to catch up in when you fall behind.
99202,"The problem sets end up taking amount a very large amount of your time every week even if you spend hours in office hours. They're also very difficult to complete if you don't attend study halls and office hours. The midterms are generally quite fair and test corrections make it easier to preform well. The problem sets, although very difficult and time consuming, are graded fairly and end up being very helpful when it comes time to study for the midterms and final."
99202,"Keep most things the same! Course benefits from a lot of accessible office hours + accessibility to peer tutors and teaching fellows for help (peer tutors in particular). Course also benefits strongly from having prerecorded lectures up, as sometimes topics are covered a bit quickly in class. I would say that decreasing the number of problems per problem set also helped a lot in terms of managing student workload with minimal detriment to student learning."
99202,I thought the course was very cool and taught effectively. The instruction was wonderful and the psets insightful. The reviews were helpful. The midterm and final exams were fair.
99202,"While I enjoyed the course, I felt that I didnt get as much out of the lectures. I often felt that they were delivered in a way that wasnt as accessible as it could have been. I think Professor Steinacker may have gone unnecessarily fast, and done unnecessarily complex examples too quickly.   I often found that it wasnt until the exam review that I deeply understood the material."
99202,"Excellent course, really teaches basic fundamentals of physics while encouraging you to apply these basic to complex questions."
99202,More staffing in office hours and more directions for TFs and TAs (for study hall) because often times they themselves would be confused on the problems as well
99202,The biggest strength of this course is its ability to prompt students to work together. This is done through really hard psets. A downside is that these psets asked for too much at times. They take hours to complete.
99203,It's fine
99203,"The exams were pretty easy and had generous grading. This made the class, which is pretty darned difficult intellectually, a lot more manageable to stomach and less of a burden on my GPA. The psets also had extensive support from TAs, which was important because they were really difficult. Sometimes I found it difficult to focus in lectures, but this generally was not a major impediment to doing well in the class."
99203,"There is so much out-of-class support built into the 200/201 sequence and it really needs it. Lectures aren't always especially organized or understandable, but office hours are always incredibly helpful on problem sets and overall understanding of the material."
99203,"The only weakness of this course in my opinion is that due to a large amount of material to cover, some lectures felt rushed and important topics were glossed over and relegated to self-study.  This is compensated by the greatest strength of the course the office hours. This course has amazing office hours, with supportive TFs and PSets which go over the material thoroughly and sufficiently. I am pretty sure someone who never comes to lectures would still be able to learn the entire course by just going to the office hours and doing the problem sets (although I havent tested this hypothesis). The amount of support offered by Professor Tipton and the TFs/TAs is truly what every course at Yale should strive towards, and even when I didnt understand something (because no-one ever truly understands quantum mechanics) I felt confident that I had somewhere to go with my questions."
99203,"The lectures are engaging and the office hours are very useful for doing psets and learning material outside of class.   Sometimes it felt like the exams were not representative of the material on psets and review material, and would often have a problem that related to one slide on a single lecture."
99203,"I think the course is impeccably structured. The lectures can be followed if you're paying attention. The psets can be difficult but there are peer tutoring sessions 5 days a week to help you with them, and unlike a lot of other courses, the peer tutors for this course are actually competent. After a while, we became so friendly with them that the sessions were actually fun. The exams were fair, usually easier than psets, and the grading for them are generous as well. There are enough practice problems posted before exams that you are well prepared enough."
99203,moved pretty quick
99203,The lectures are a tad boring and long but they are sometimes interesting.
99203,"I think that the lectures could be made more clear if Prof. Tipton were to write on the board instead of going really quickly through his powerpoints. I think that this would help pace the class better, too."
99203,"One strength of this course is that it provides an introduction to many important subfields of physics. I particularly appreciated the treatment of quantum mechanics and founded it to be a good complement to my quantum computing course. I also appreciated the numerous office hour sessions offered to help students complete the assignments.  One challenge with this course is that material is introduced very rapidly, making it sometimes difficult to internalize. Additionally, there were times when the homework problems felt unclear or provided insufficient clarification to communicate the task being solved."
99203,"The course was very well taught and the content was engaging. I thought the textbook for the course wasnt particularly great - maybe Griffiths is beyond the level of this course (arguable), but I found it a better resource, especially for practice questions. Prof Tiptons lecture notes were very extensive, however, which definitely helped"
99203,"Strengths - same as with 200. Highly organized and with a clear focus for each lecture. Example problems and PollEVs contribute to overall engagement. Weaknesses - as with 200, the length of the slides themselves sometimes makes it so that we have no idea what is ""important"" and what is not. Sometimes there will be long tangents about a derivation when what we need is a boxed formula at the end -- too many things are labeled in bold to show if they are meaningful. The optics lecture specifically could also be improved."
99203,"I loved the balance between psets, lectures, and office hours in aiding my understanding of course concepts. I have no complaints about the ability of the course and the instructor to convey all of the information and skills I needed to know to succeed."
99203,I really liked the example problems and how open Professor Tipton was to questions! It was also incredibly engaging! One point of feedback would be the lecture slidesa few times there were some errors in equations.
99203,"This is an excellent course! Lectures are clear and organized, for the most part, and office hours are helpful enough to make up for any missed or difficult material."
99203,"A strength and weakness is the breadth of the class content. As an intro course it makes sense to learn about numerous topics, but some days felt so rushed and we barely learned enough about a topic to understand it."
99203,"I liked the content this course covered (electromag, GR, quantum, cosmolgy)! The problem sets (compared to 200) were a bit more reasonable in length and in my opinion, more fun/understandable. I think this course could be improved by having a bit more organization on the slides, but the information on the slides was all very helpful!"
99203,"The strength of this course is its dedication to ensuring that all students understand complex topics. Professor Tipton manages to break down very complex topics into digestible chunks that allow you to build a solid and nuanced understanding of the material. This course could be improved by moving a little more quickly through electrodynamics, as it often dwells too much on some topics that the class already understands."
99203,"Strengths: much of the material is interesting Weaknesses: the amount of time spent on each concept is sometimes minimal, while the resources for study outside of class are small"
99203,The homeworks do not reflect what we learned in class. It could be helpful for Prof. Tipton to make it clear at the beginning of the semester that we are expected to use the internet/reference textbooks for problems that require knowledge on things we did not learn in class. Also it may be helpful to host a session on how to find the right information/equations to use using the internet.
99203,"I thought this course covered a lot, and possibly a little too quickly. For instance, in the quantum physics unit, it was difficult to fully understand the intuition of everything even if it checked out mathematically. Also, in the circuits unit, I was quite confused with actually solving problems by using the loop rule. Many times, it seemed that the direction of current through resistors were ""guesses"" and the intuition was unclear. Overall, however, I felt the class was very solid."
99203,Well taught and organized
99203,"I liked the lecture, and I think problem sets were always reasonable. The format of tests I thought was great and well made. Sometimes, in long convoluted derivations it would be easy to get lost, but Prof Tipton always did a good job of summarizing the main points to takeaway."
99203,"The main strength of this course was the teaching staff and the experiences during office hours. Although it would take time out of class to meet with either Professor Tipton or attend one of the study sessions held by the TFs / peer tutors, I enjoyed having a designated place and time to ask questions and work on physics among peers who were equally interested in solving those same problems. Professor Tipton is also a very charismatic lecturer, which lends well to days when the physics was not particularly interesting.   I think that the pacing of some lectures was a bit difficult to follow at times. For some concepts, I would need additional explanation to fully understand them. However, the safety net of office hours / study sessions helped with this issue. (It would be difficult to keep track of lecture material by oneself if one did not have any spare time to go to office hours, however.)"
99203,"The class is very well structured for improvement in physics. Outside of professor Tipton's engaging lectures, there are office hours that are available in the evening and even the morning of the day the pset is due making it easy to find a time that works and go get help. In addition, the slideshows Professor Tipton makes for each lesson are easy to go back to and reread to gain a stronger understanding of the material. I also like the fact that I never feel pressed for time on exams and feel that the only limiting factor when taking them is my understanding of the material. I do wish for the optics unit we spent a bit more time going over things like raying diagrams and lenses as I just hadn't seen them in a while."
99203,"Strengths: psets and tests actually test you on the course material, never really any surprises"
99203,The biggest strength of the course is the number of Peer Tutor/TF hours on the schedule as well as Professor Tipton's teaching.
99203,This course had lots of very useful resources including the many office hours from professor Tipton and the TAs.
99203,solid intro course -- needed for physics major
99203,"This is a great course. The only improvement is having a greater coordination about problem sets, as there should not have been that many instances of problems which just got removed because they were that suboptimal."
99203,"Prof Tipton is the gem of this class. Incredibly kind, clear lectures, good at answering questions. Homeworks can sometimes be challenging but office hours help."
99203,"Strengths: Lots of office hours and help. Moreover, there are usually other students during office hours, so it is easy to collaborate on the psets. Probably the biggest strength is https://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-201 . The entire material in Physics 201 is covered in the online lectures in basically the same way. In other words, you can essentially take Phys 201 asynchronously. Weakness: The Psets were terrible. Some of the questions REQUIRED office hours."
99215,"Girvin is a very cool instructor. Talking to him about quantum computing and his career at office hours was very enjoyable.  Grading for this course was very strict, especially for a Yale physics course. Despite getting problems on the psets correct, they would nonetheless lose points for often trivial things. I would recommend taking off minimal points for trivial things, as most other physics courses do, and then leave comments so the students make changes.  The grading weight of this course should also be adjusted. Homework is only 15%, which is insane considering how much time it takes. The final paper was 35%, which is also insane considering most students probably did it in about 3 days (compared to weekly homeworks).  The final paper expectations also need to be adjusted. We had weekly homeworks, plus a 10 page paper, plus a final exam. If there is going to be a long final paper, there should be no homeworks for a couple weeks while we do the paper. If the homeworks need to remain weekly (they were shorter as the paper deadline came up), then the final paper should be shorter. I think the expectations for the final paper should be much different. It would be better if the paper was 4-5 pages and was meant to give a more conceptual overview of a topic. The current format of needing to do mathematical derivations was confusing as we were not sure how complicated the derivations were supposed to be. It would be much better to keep the weekly homeworks, as it would help us review the various quantum algorithms (Simon's, etc), which are very important and seemed a bit rushed toward the final exam as we never did extensive homeworks with them. With these weekly homeworks, the final paper should only be 4-5 pages.  The exam structure of choosing problems to do is nice.  Using the IBM hardware for homeworks was very cool, but we should do more demos of it in class. It was confusing to figure out how it works on our own."
99215,"nice intro to quantum, not a lot of depth but also topic is very new"
99215,"This course was a great introduction and felt very understandable and relevant to practical applications. It also provided a good survey of several important topics in present day quantum computing research, including error correction, optimization, and quantum algorithms.  The only improvement I can think to suggest is to include an overview of the physical side of quantum computing---types of qubits, how to construct physical gate operations, how to quantify qubit noise and gate fidelity, etc."
99215,"Strengths: Really cool subject material, and Professor Girvin is great! He does a fantastic job getting to the core, interesting part of whatever he's teaching instead of getting bogged down in nitpicky details, while still giving a completely rigorous lecture. His excitement for the material (which is his expertise) is infectious. He also loves talking with students at office hours, and makes good course notes. Weaknesses: none."
99215,The course was well structured.
99215,"I believe the final project could have a bit more structure (perhaps showing us a past example project), or we could instead create a chapter in the qiskit textbook for example."
99215,"The class was very well taught and the progression of ideas was natural and interesting. PSETs were challenging but helpful for getting practice with the concepts. The support structure for the class between Professor Girvin, the TAs, and the ULAs was absolutely fantastic. One area for improvement is a more complete set of course notes."
99215,Great notes and textbook. Concepts and psets could be confusing at times.
99215,"I wish the course moved faster at times. We only got to the interesting algorithms in the last 3-4 classes. The classes also got shifted back about half a lecture, so it was a little awkward because we would begin by finishing an old derivation and then start a new derivation, and in doing so we lost a bunch of time reviewing material from the previous lectures."
99215,"Strength: course notes are very detailed and organized, office hours are very helpful, professor's lecture is very clear  Weakness: the time left for final project is too little"
99215,Strengths: Professor Girvin is great and its a fantastic opportunity to learn from him. Problem sets are effective and not too time intensive. Office hours are helpful. Weaknesses: guidelines around final project are unclear and I think it would have been helpful to have some more clarity or structure around it. Final project grading also seemed somewhat arbitrary.
99215,Material was taught in a very accessible way. Psets were relevant and thought-provoking without being too much work.
99215,"This class was relatively good, but having a final paper of 10 pages and a final exam is too much."
99215,"This class had great lectures, great office hours, and great TAs. It was really easy to get more highly engaged in the material if you wanted to. Professor Girvin's office hours were always great. They were mainly aimed at discussing and whiteboarding general topics within the course, rather than simply helping with the homework. It was really great to have this time to talk about the more interesting sides of quantum computing, especially because the TAs were always there to help with the homework aspect during their own office hours.   As for weaknesses, I wish that the problem sets made up a larger portion of the final grade in the course. I spent a lot of time working on those assignments each weak, but they only accounted for a cumulative 15% of the grade. Meanwhile, each exam accounted for 25%. This is a difficult distribution for anybody that experiences test anxiety, or anybody who simply happens to have a rough day on the day of one of the exams.   That being said, I appreciated the content of the problem sets. I also really enjoyed the final essay. And the exam questions were extremely fair."
99215,Nicely taught and interesting material!
99215,The applications side of this course (uses of entanglement/algorithms) was very interesting. The course notes were confusing at points but still helpful when doing the psets.
99219,"The course is fast paced, but the professor is fantastic, and the material makes sense in lecture."
99219,"Strengths - great TAs and Prof. Skiba is very nice and charming.  Weaknesses - everything else. Final exam was way too difficult and it was physically impossible to prepare for it. Class average on the midterm was a 50% (40% excluding the 3 outliers who got a 100% - keep in mind this is a class of 50 ish students). Too much content taught in a semester. Each class consisted of Skiba doing 2 hours of unilluminating vector algebra on the board while making errors and mumbling to himself what he was doing, so it was difficult to follow. Moreover, this was mainly formula derivations already present in the textbook, which was useless for the PSets/exams. Instead, it would be better if we were taught how to apply the concepts to PSet like problems. There was such a big gap between what Skiba thought we knew and what we actually knew (which was nothing!) and we were speeding through content way too fast to even be able to catch up with what we don't know.  Here's how to fix the problem of the absurd amount of material rushed through in this class: Start with Maxwell's equations week 1, don't derive everything from scratch (it's unnecessary and doesn't teach us anything, that's what the book should be for!), explain how to use Maxwell in PSet style problems (maybe 1 week on Ampere/Gauss's law), and then do EM induction + waves + the rest of post-midterm content for the entire semester."
99219,Lectures were very fast and hard to follow most of the time Also the exams were on content that was much more difficult than anything we'd seen on psets and sometimes content that we hadn't seen before at all.
99219,"This was prof. Skibas first time teaching the course, but it was still well-organized on the whole. I think there were some lessons in the second half (mostly about radiation) that we spent a little too much time on and therefore we didnt get any practice with the new stuff at the end, but overall very cool."
99219,Very hard psets (in my opinion) and the exams are no different
99219,"Weaknesses: I can't say I learned a lot in this class. We certainly covered a lot of content, but the amount that I (and my friends) retained is miniscule. Prof Skiba's lectures were mainly composed of math, without much, if any, physical explanation of what each derivation and equation we were being shown actually represented. It was really difficult to develop any physical intuition for the situations we were being presented with because the physics each equation described was never, or only very very briefly, explained to us. Problem sets were so hard that often we would show up at office hours and the TAs wouldn't even know how to solve the problems. Prof Skiba didn't provide the TAs with solutions, so they had to spend many extra hours of their own time figuring out how to solve the problems, and then a few days later, when they did get it, they would essentially have to give us the whole explanation of the answer, because the problems were simply too complicated for us to come to solutions on our own. The midterm exam was really difficult and the class average was really low, but Prof Skiba never addressed it in class or in an email or anything, and continued to teach as he had been before when obviously that wasn't working for us. We spoke to the TAs and they assured us they talked to him about changing his lecture format to include more physics rather than just all math, but he never did change the way he lectured. The final exam was outrageously difficult, and completely undoable, because while Prof Skiba told us that the exam questions would only be on topics we'd covered on the problem sets, none of the questions were like anything we'd ever seen before -- not in the psets, not in lecture, and not in even in the textbook. This class has made me and a bunch of my friends stop liking physics, or at least stop liking electrodynamics, and some of us are switching out of the major because of it. Strengths: the textbook. The Griffiths textbook is really good and if Prof Skiba is teaching is class again, teaching yourself out of the textbook is your best bet."
99219,"Strengths: the textbook, Intro to Electrodynamics by Griffiths, is fantastic. I learned far more from the textbook than from lectures  Weaknesses: Prof. Skibas lectures were extremely unhelpful. The best way I can describe it is he did very disorganized derivations (sometimes with mistakes) at us for 75 minutes. He rarely ever provided any physical motivation for the math he was doing, so it was very difficult to connect how to apply the lectures to the problem sets. Speaking of the problem sets, they were frequently so difficult that the TAs didnt know how to solve the problems, and Prof. Skiba didnt provide solutions. The midterm exam was extremely difficult with a very low average. Prof. Skiba never addressed this, and simply continued the course the way he had been. The final exam was preposterous. Prof. Skiba told us the exam questions would be such that we could effectively prepare by studying the problem sets. This was wrong. The exam looked nothing like our problem sets, midterm, or even the textbook."
99219,"It was very fast-paced, which was good. However, I think some of the lectures could have benefitted from more preparation. Although I love Skiba and the fact that he rederived everything on the fly was very impressive, there were a few mistakes here and there which definitely slowed the course down a bit and led to some confusion. Lastly, while relativity is definitely very cool and the main equations at the end of the course were satisfying, it felt a bit rushed and was definitely not done justice. I think the course might have benefitted from diving more deeply into other topics rather than trying to cover that much of relativity in two weeks."
99219,"Skiba is a very nice and funny person. Unfortunately, he cannot teach to save his life. This class has so much content, but he was unable to convey any of it effectively. Also his exams are totally unreasonable."
99219,Taught well. Good structure.
99219,"The textbook was good, but lectures were very difficult to follow. The professor would derive various expressions in the blackboard, but struggled to explain the concepts in a way that we could understand. The class consisted of a lot of concepts that we had never seen before, and I feel like we were all struggling to understand and survive rather than learning at a comfortable pace."
99219,"Great p sets, lectures should have given an overview before diving into derivations"
99219,"Strengths: Professor Skiba is funny and a fairly engaging lecturer. He brought in a few demonstrations, which were quite cool, and was happy to answer questions during class and office hours. The exams are fair - you can tell that Prof. Skiba tries solving the questions before he assigns them. Griffiths is a great textbook, and can shore up your understanding of the material (especially since Prof. Skiba follows the textbook fairly closely). The lectures teach material effectively - unlike in 261, I didn't need to rely on the textbook to teach me things. Weaknesses: once or twice, a whole class was spent on a long derivation, motivated at the beginning and explained at the end but without much physical intuition for what happened in between. It might be nice to pause more frequently to evaluate what we're doing."
99219,"This course was good at giving a good overview of the specific concepts, topics, and problem solving tools that are essential to Electrodynamics. I learned quite a bit about how to solve important equations (namely Maxwell's equations in a variety of contexts) and how to apply these skills to different sets of problems. However, I believe we covered too much content to be easily digestible during a semester-long course. It sometimes felt like drinking out of a firehouse, and I know that this was not conducive to our learning in this course. I feel like I learned much less about Electrodynamics because we tried to cover so much content, and I have had trouble retaining the content I was able to learn because I was so rushed doing so."
99219,"The course covered far too much material for a single semester, leaving us with a very weak grasp on some important topics which should have been covered more in-depth. The problem sets were difficult, but reasonable. The exams however were not reasonable. We were told that the final would only cover topics which were on the homework, but multiple topics on the exam were never in our homework, leaving us completely unprepared for the final."
99219,"Weaknesses: Lectures were dry, psets were long and exams were far too difficult   Strengths: Shivnag Sista was a great ta"
99219,"The strength of the course was the lectures, which were engaging, and of course Griffiths. Also, the TFs were very helpful with consolidating concepts and helping with psets. The only weakness of the course was the midterm and final, which I felt were too difficult. Maybe not the midterm, since the problems resembled the homework pretty well. But the difficulty of the final felt completely unexpected."
99219,"This entirely depends on the Professor teaching the class, but the exams were unfairly difficult. The average for the midterm was just a bit over 50% and the final was somehow worse."
99219,"Strengths: teaches a lot of material quite well. Potential improvements: maybe at the beginning of a derivation, give more indication about where the math is going, so that we understand the motivation for each step (or when there is no motivation, let us know so we aren't looking for one!)"
99219,"This course moved through the textbook (Griffiths) wayyyyy too fast. The textbook itself recommends that only chapters 1-7 be covered in one semester, but Professor Skiba covered the entire book (chapters 1-12). This pace was way too fast and resulted in most students not actually learning anything: we all had trouble keeping up (no time to digest the material because every lecture is a new topic) and the psets were insanely difficult.   Furthermore, since Professor Skiba made up the pset problems himself, we had no solutions that we could reference, so if we couldn't do a problem, we were just stuck and had no way of learning anything from that problem. If pset problems were assigned straight from the textbook, we may not know how to do the problems immediately, but at least we could read the solution and learn something about the problem.  This course MUST slow down its pace."
99219,Phinaincs hard
99219,"Strengths:  Ample amount of office hour sessions (which you will most definitely need to utilize) and instructor is willing to make more resources available should the need arise.  Weaknesses: The course progresses way too fast and it is very clear that this was the instructor's first time teaching this course because he tries to cover way too much in one semester but just ends up creating more confusion as the students desperately try to keep up. Even before the midterm, a majority of the students stopped being able to understand the lectures and relied entirely on the homework problem sets to figure out what topics to go through and review in the textbook. Skiba also refuses to post the lecture notes on Canvas, which makes the task of trying to catch up that much more difficult. Another weakness, though not entirely the instructor's fault, is that this course is not at all geared towards non-physics majors.   Lectures themselves were subpar overall because the big picture is regularly obscured, so students have no idea why the instructor is doing what hes doing. Furthermore, its understood that students are supposed to extract different solution and analysis methods from the lectures, but the instructor often gets lost in his own algebra such that it becomes incredibly difficult to follow his line of reasoning. The outcome is leaving lecture more lost than when you entered and praying the textbook does a better job of explaining. Again, part of the problem comes down to the fact that the instructor moved too fast through the material."
99219,"This class is overloaded with content and not enough time is spent on anything for any actual learning to occur. When pairing that with lectures that were disorganized and poorly explained, it felt like it was more beneficial to not attend class at all and simply read the book instead."
99219,"Many lectures were spent deriving formulas, but sometimes it was hard to follow because steps were skipped, and things generally felt a little rushed. It would have been helpful to know what chapters of the book corresponded to the lectures, and it would have also helped if there were some lecture notes available online."
99219,"It seems like their was a lot of material covered in this class, but that may be the nature of electrodynamics. I thought Professor Skiba moved quickly through the material but this was necessary given the amount. The textbook was great and we closely followed it, and the TAs/office hours were really helpful."
99219,"The tests are incredibly hard and we do not know the curve until after the class is over. Also we had to turn the psets in physically which was a bit annoying. Griffiths himself writes in his textbook that a one-semester course has its hands full with the first seven chapters of the textbook; we try to cover all of it, and made it through chapter 10 and into 11. This meant a more rushed treatment of chapters 4 and 6, and not enough time to get used to the sudden ramp-up in algebra starting with chapter 9."
99224,"I felt the strengths of this course were the content as well as Professor Allison. He is a great lecturer and does a really excellent job presenting the material. However, I felt that my section discussion was not very helpful."
99224,strengths: i like how we do projects because it allows us to apply real world problems to what we have been learning weakness: at times it feels like what we are learning in class doesn't always translate to the questions on exam
99224,The course was very organized and interesting.
99224,N/a
99224,"I thought the lectures were very interesting and I enjoyed attending class. The weaknesses for me were that the professor spoke too quickly to take notes on the lectures. In addition, it felt as if the class could use some more logistical clarification. Both projects were each worth 20% of the overall class grade but the project guidelines were no more than 4 sentences."
99224,A good intro but heavily politicised to represent the views of the Professor which was uncomfortable at times
99224,Could be improved by having lectures also about Africa and South America. Can focus less on the World Wars and instead talk more about international relations in today's world.
99224,"Strengths - material was very interesting, readings were solid (relevant both to class and current events), I found the professor's lectures engaging, and the theories/core ideas were well explained. Discussion section was lively and helpful. Weaknesses - needing to cite readings on the exam took away some from understanding the material and was tedious at times. While I learning about enjoyed about the military history aspects of IR, I feel like the course could have a little more variety (for instance, more time spent on international institutions/law, the role of espionage in international relations, the history of US backed regime change around the world, etc.)"
99224,"I liked the decision to emphasize the development of social science skills through the projects. I understand that this was the first year making that change and that there are some kinks that need to be worked out (making the deadlines for the experimental data project hard unless you have a legitimate excuse might be a good place to start to prevent delays), but I hope the emphasis is maintained going forward. I also think the lectures were engaging and well connected with the course readings, and, at least for Michael's section, sections did a good job of further diving into and teaching the material for the course in a way that improved understanding."
99224,"Class is extremely boring. Not very interacting , just listening to the teacher read off the slides, no real need for the instructor. Section much more helpful then lecture."
99224,"Strengths: quizzes, papers, tests  Weaknesses: could have had more focus on international relations and politics of other countries rather than such a high focus on different warfare and gun types"
99224,"The lectures of this course are engaging and the course has a great range of material to draw on for the semester. This course has an interesting mixture of history, science, and social studies that make this a good introductory course for, not only political science students but also any student interested in the social sciences. This course is, however, in the process of making changes to its style of teaching with new elements such as the experimental survey project and the data collection project. While I enjoyed the process of making these, there are still kinks to iron out. For example, the experimental survey project was given quite early in the semester, before we had many topics to choose from. Still, the effort in teaching us and taking a risk on a new approach is greatly appreciated."
99224,"One nice aspect was that the subjects were so broad and interconnected that by the end of the semester, I felt like I had a good understanding of the foundations of political science. However, sometimes it felt like it was so rigidly following a structure that it didnt maximise on engagement. For instance, the readings were restricted to just the theories and there wasnt much time spent on the relevance to current affairs."
99224,"Strengths: Prof. Allison is a fantastic lecturer. Content was EXTREMELY interesting and I wished most classes were longer than 50 minutes. I also thought the projects were very well structured and the course itself was very well organized. The readings all had a clear purpose and were not overwhelming, especially because of Prof. Allison's organization system. Genuinely loved this course and I'm so happy I took it as a non-political science major. I especially loved the ""applied history"" portions of the course, as well as classes about nuclear policy, the rise of China, and the Russian war in Ukraine. Feedback from TFs was clear and extremely helpful and TFs were very accessible to students.  Weaknesses: Focus was often placed on Western history and Western schools of thought, though other narratives and ideas were included in the course. It would be nice if non-Western perspectives were more integrated into the main narrative of the course (ie if different ideas and histories were more frequently held in comparison/contrast with each other rather than using non-Western examples to support/reject Western narratives/ideas)"
99224,"The organization of the coursework was one of its major strengths. The must, should, could system of reading was incredibly helpful in facilitating the workload. However, I wish there was more of an emphasis on the history and present-day state of cooperation and the liberal international order, rather than military history and strategy."
99224,"This course was very interesting, from the lectures, to the sections, to the majority of the readings. I really found the content as well as the professor to be incredibly engaging. The only thing that could maybe be improved would be the volume of readings since a lot of times what we learn in the lectures is the application of multiple readings that seemed to say the same thing, but maybe they could have been condensed in light of work load for all other classes."
99224,"This course was not well-planned. Lectures were good, but the major assignments were not planned well and one should have been removed. Sections also seemed to vary greatly."
99224,Very engaging
99224,Overall an ideal introduction to IR. It does exactly what it sets out to do. I was impressed by how much it taught given how little work it required.
99224,"More focus on fewer readings, very little feedback from TAs, projects were a bit meaningless"
99224,Great course. I think data projects could be a bit more streamlined.
99224,Lectures too fast-paced for effective note taking.
99224,I think its a good course but sort of repetitive. We talk about the same topics a lot
99224,Heavy emphasis on military history as opposed to overview of international relations as a whole
99224,"Strengths: Well taught, sections are interesting, TA's and the professor are great, broadly interesting readings, engaging lectures.  Weaknesses: Nothing major, but a few of the readings were rather dry. This was more than offset by other readings that were fascinating."
99224,veery detailed the statistical part wasnt explained well
99224,"I really appreciated how the professor was very open to students asking questions or extensions, etc. Ive never asked myself but he showed that he was very understanding and encouraged students to come talk to him if they needed to."
99224,The strengths are the engaging lectures and content. Weaknesses are that the lectures sometimes felt disjointed.
99224,"Strengths: Lectures are interesting and incredibly engaging, course material feels relevant and balanced (Professor Allison made a point to include information about current events in his lecture, which was fascinating), and Professor Allison cares deeply about both the success of his students and the material covered. Readings are also quite manageable and interesting, and the overall workload is not at all overwhelming. I especially appreciated the two projects, which gave me my first experience in political science experimentation and data collection/interpretation.  Weaknesses: I definitely struggled with the online quizzes in this class, and felt that the strict time pressure made it hard to retrieve answers from my notes and limited my ability to demonstrate what I learned. I think I would have benefitted from a different quiz format (perhaps an in-person quiz during section), but overall this weakness is incredibly small compared to the strengths of the course."
99224,"I really enjoyed the structure of this course. I feel as though it was very easy to follow and each lecture flowed from one to the next. The professor also typically introduced the topic of the upcoming lecture the week prior, so I always felt like I knew what was coming next and where I was supposed to be to remain on track. However, the formatting and releasing of the quizzes created a bit of a struggle for me. I felt that towards the end, we were a bit rushed to finish all the quizzes since there was such a lag between the first quiz (free points) to the second quiz and the second quiz to the third quiz. It was also difficult at moments because though the quizzes were meant to be fairly simply, the questions were sometimes very specific thus difficult to answer with such a short time limit. I wish the spacing between the quizzes would have been a bit more consistent and there would not have been a time limit on the quizzes."
99224,"This course is very reading heavy, most of which I feel was not discussed or engaged with during class and discussion; however, the course did provide a good overview of International Relations."
99224,"Personally, I felt like a lot of this course was review for me because of classes I had previously taken. I did enjoy how the lectures clearly taught concepts and gave context to those concepts."
99224,"I thought the lectures were engaging and the evaluations were fair. I think my discussion section could have been significantly improved. The readings were quite long and it meant most of my section didn't complete them at all- most of our ""discussions"" were sitting in silence, listening to our tf summarize a reading, or watching our tf correct another student's summary of a reading."
99224,I think we could spend more time China and how they their influence around the world at the expense of the U.S. and the potential implications this may have in the future.
99224,"The course was organized very well and easy to follow. Each lecture featured a different topic and the two lectures every week were related so the content did not feel very rushed. PLSC 111 also used a very helpful system to organize its readings, categorizing them into ""must readings,"" ""should readings,"" and ""could readings."" This system allowed me to focus on the most important readings and saved a lot of time. The lectures and sections were great reviews for the readings but also introduced new topics. I also appreciate how Professor Allison spent time each lecture to discuss any arising international relations news that happened that week. One way the course could be improved is to have more resources about ways to engage in international relations studies at Yale and beyond. Much of the content taught was theoretical, which is understandable since this is an intro class, but more information about ways to apply it and put it into practice would be nice."
99224,"Strengths: The TF staff clearly wanted to work with him, so they were very motivated for their students to do well. I would also say that the reading list was very good, and if you read (which you really should) made the course all the more interesting.   Weaknesses: If you take this class with Allison you will have to do two projects. Although I can see the application of the projects to field work in political science, I would say that the expectation were not that clear. I think that there could have been more than just a canvas post to describe the requirements and expectations for these two summative assignments."
99269,"The lectures are overall very engaging, but at times they can venture into topics that are unrelated to the material. The class is very fast paced, so students to learn a lot, but the guidelines for the assignments are very vague, so it is important to discuss those directly with the TA's."
99269,"Best course I've taken at Yale. Interesting lectures, fascinating subject area, engaging readings and sections. All around amazing."
99269,"Strengths: the readings, Professor Amar's books supplement the course really well, and the sections led by teaching fellows are a must have. They are all such wonderful TA's who have such interesting backgrounds that bring them to this course Weaknesses: sometimes Professor Amar's lectures ramble a little bit and are hard to follow, but having the section there helps with that"
99269,"The strengths are the TAs and the content, and the weakness is Akhil Amar. The lectures were incredibly useless and did not clarify anything about the topics we were studying. But the sections and review session were fascinating and I learned 90% of what I know from this class with the TAs."
99269,"Professor Amar's lectures are very engaging, and he is clearly a scholar of the material. My section was also a strength -- our section leader, Robert Capodilupo, did a great job of consolidating and explaining the material in a clear manner. I would say that a main weakness was the lack of organization of the lectures. I often left class confused about what the main point was and only understood the takeaways of the material after attending section. I think that the lectures would do well with a bit more of an outline and structure."
99269,"The material itself is extremely interesting. Professor Amar assigns a fair amount of reading from his own books while a useful supplement, the cases are really where you learn."
99269,"Strength: Professor Amar is a great lecturer, and I've heard nothing but amazing things about the TA's.  Weaknesses: Some of the lectures were off topic, and I wish the class would occasionally read something by other authors."
99269,"strengths: The exams are intensive but help cement the material you've learned. TAs are amazing and you can attend as many of their sessions as you wish  weaknesses: anything you get out of ConLaw is what you put in. If you don't want to read ahead, go to section, or even read at all, you'll get nothing out of this"
99269,"Amar's lectures can sometimes be a bit all over the place, but section is a life saver. I could not have understood the class material without going to section. I think that the final should not be 60% of our grade, that is kind of ridiculous."
99269,"The course covers a LOT of material which is great but overwhelming. I found myself relying almost exclusively on external resources (Oyez, TF summaries) rather than the cases because it was simply not possible to get through all of it."
99269,"I really liked the structure of the grading system, particularly how there is an opportunity to write an optional research paper that can only have a positive impact on your grade (and would be disregarded if it were to have a negative impact). The teaching fellows were also extraordinary and exceeding helpful during lectures, sections, and while preparing for exams. Professor Amar also dedicated so much time to supporting us, including at lectures, post-lecture lunches, and during office hours each week."
99269,Professor Amar is really passionate about the material and lectures are really engaging.
99269,Strength: the discussion session is very helpful.
99269,"Personally, I wish the lectures were a bit more engaging and the syllabus was clearer on what cases we would need to know. I found that many TFs were recommending different cases for issues and that got confusing."
99269,"Strengths: course material, engaging readings, wonderful and intelligent TFs  Weakness: sometimes, lectures lacked structure"
99269,The lectures were often very confusing and hard to follow. They could be seriously improved with structure such as slides. The courses strengths were the teaching fellows and how they cleared up the lectures.
99269,"Strengths: section is very useful, the cases are interesting   Weaknesses: while I enjoy Amar's lectures, they're kind of all over the place. They're primary use is that in the middle of an exam, I may remember what he said about some cases and think ""I bet he wrote about this"". Then find a quote from his book."
99269,"The strengths of this course were the professor, the content, and the exams, which really taught me to understand the material well. Perhaps the weakness was too many assigned readings. I wasn't able to do all of them, so I would have liked fewer so I knew which ones to focus on."
99269,"I absolutely loved this course and found the material fascinating. That said, it would be nice if Professor Amar didn't repeat himself for the first 30 minutes of every class so that we could actually cover all of the material without leaving it to section."
99269,"Amars lectures are hard to follow and tangential, and almost sometimes totally unrelated to the readings, section, or exams. the TA's however, are fantastic and brilliant and a quick and organized resource. they taught me everything"
99269,Professor Amar's generosity in time and knowledge (as well as our TF's engagement) were the highlights of this course. The only improvement I can think of is that lectures could sometimes be a bit more structured.
99269,"Readings and section were great, lectures are often rambling and unhelpful"
99269,"While brilliant, Professor Amar's lectures tend to be unorganized and difficult to understand. Much of my practical learning was done in a section with my teaching fellow. One of this course's strengths is that it treats students like law students. Professor Amar is also committed to the well-being of undergraduates and even goes as far as getting regular meals with students. This course does a wonderful job of exposing students to new ideas and challenging old ones."
99269,"Strengths: Amar is brilliant! Section for this course is fantastic highly recommend!  Weaknesses: Lectures slightly unorganized, your notes might be a bit of a mess."
99269,"Strengths: Super dedicated professor, Great section & TAs, challenging, opportunity to engage outside of physical course at lunches Weaknesses: Lectures were not very structured, difficult assessments, lots of reading"
99269,Lectures could be more structured
99269,"Strengths: Sections and TA are the best aspects of the course. Amar's scholarship is expansive and impressive. The class ties well into current legal affairs and debates. The course content is very important and interesting.   Weaknesses: The beginning of the course spends too much time on one aspect of judicial power, judicial review, and the end of the course has an exorbitant, perhaps unrealistic amount of reading for undergraduates with 3-5 other classes. There should be better balance, perhaps more evenly distributing the amount of reading and content, to allow students to more fully engage with the material, especially at the end of the course. Amar's lectures and books are densely packed, go on many different tangents, and are, as a result, not very useful or accessible when engaging with other elements of the course. Expectations for the midterm and final exam are unclear if not unrealistic. For example, written instructions make no mention of citing Amar's books, but some TAs emphasized the importance of doing so mere days before the exams while others emphasize the importance of instead spotting and explaining issues. It is understandable that the exams are meant to feel like a true law school exam, but if that is the case, the TAs and Amar can be more forthcoming about how long the exams will take to complete and how long they are expected to be (i.e., Do not say students will not have to take a full 8 hour or 24 hours for the exam when many students indeed had to.)"
99269,"Amazing course. Absolutely loved it. Amar is a strength as I found him to be incredibly engaging as a professor. Only thing is that sometimes he lacked a little order with the syllabus and would spend like 30 mins in the beginning of class summarizing what happened last week, which was a bit excessive at times."
99269,"Strengths: Akhil Amar is a terrific lecturer, elucidating key details from the casework, making the course accessible to a STEM major, and teaching one how to think through opinions in the context of history. His lunches were also quite fun, and an incredible opportunity. Don't be scared of the workload. I spent about the same amount of time on reading as I would on the weekly pset in an intro science / math class.  Weaknesses: Akhil Amar is not very modest, although he does not have great reason to be, so this is somewhat understandable. Additionally, the course is more a history of law course, taught through stories, than a constitutional law course. Go to section! All the section leaders were hand picked, are law school students, and they will get you through the exams."
99274,lectures were very interesting and Professor Latham is an incredible speaker but sometimes lectures were difficult to follow or know since there are no slides
99274,Essentially no weaknesses. Loved this course.
99274,"The strengths are that the course is extremely engaging, fun, and well organized, as well as a very low workload. The weakness is that the assigned reading for the course is literally hundreds of pages per week, but we are not tested on them during the midterms (hint: don't do them). Another weakness is that the grading on the midterms is relatively harsh, and it is a bit annoying that the midterms purely test memorization."
99274,"I think this course is very well organized, has manageable tests and very few assignments. I found Dr. Latham to be an interesting but followable lecturer, and I think the TFs had good ways of connecting the content. I can't think of any way the course could be improved."
99274,The teaching fellow I got assigned to was fantastic in that she was very efficient about summarizing the main points we needed to know for each week's lecture. Professor Latham was also a very knowledgeable professor and you could tell that he was truly passionate about the topics he lectured on.
99274,"strengths -- Professor Latham and the syllabus! he's awesome, and I feel like I learned so so much from this class"
99274,"Strengths: super interesting material, weakness: grade only revolves around three exams"
99274,Strengths: Very interesting subject matter and fun discussions not only to engage in during section but with friends and family outside of class as well Weaknesses: Information could have been presented in a more streamlined fashion
99274,"Strengths: timely and relevant, especially with pandemic and recent advances in CRISPR gene editing Weaknesses: exams require a ridiculous amount of memorization. If you missed even one detail/court case in a three page essay, they marked you down a whole grade."
99274,Strengths -- Prof Latham is amazing. The subject material is fascinating and organized very well. The reading is relevant and maps well onto the readings.  Weaknesses - none!
99274,"I loved how this course was taught. The issues are personalized and the level of understanding that professor latham has of the material is very cool. I appreciated the level of understanding he had of the topic and how he wove his personal experiences into the material. The TA system needs to be streamlined, however. The TAs were crazy."
99274,The course is very engaging. The sections were helpful.
99274,"The course was great overall, with incredibly engaging lecturer and fair tests. My one note is that section attendance and reading responses gave no credit, and could instead only remove from your final grade if you missed too many. This felt of punitive and not useful, and changing this to being 10% or 20% of the grade instead would feel more fair."
99274,"Strengths: fascinating topics, Professor Latham's lecture style Weaknesses: some discussion sections may be less engaging their others since TAs have the freedom to discuss what it is they want from lecture. This also amounted in different sections having more or less knowledge on specific cases that would make their way into exams / exam reviews."
99274,The strength of the course is Professor Latham's understandable lecture style and how the different topics were interconnected. I wish that one of the exams was replaced with an essay that allows students to pull in their own interests and more current news events  I will say that a different classroom than Davies would be better for a 9 am M-W bioethics lecture...
99274,Lectures were very good.
99274,The strength was the seminar and discussion session to help clarify the many complicated issues noted in the book.
99274,"Great course and very interesting subject, Prof Latham is very engaging and clear in what he says"
99274,Strength is Professor Latham and the TAs! Everyone cares and gives so much time. Weakness is that the final is 50% of the grade.
99274,"Strengths: Professor Latham's lectures are incredible. During lecture you always feel engaged and leave the lecture hall with a ton of new information and insights. Additionally, the readings are not egregious, and the course has a fair amount of work. I thought the topics were well arranged as well.  Weaknesses: none"
99274,Strengths: fascinating course material; engaging lectures; constantly updated as new cases emerge  Weaknesses: seemingly arbitrary grading; lengthy/tedious readings
99274,This course is a really good extra course if your schedule is too busy.
99274,"Strengths: Prof Latham is quite engaging. He has no slides or other material, just him speaking for an hour and 15 minutes which surprisingly kept me engaged.  Weaknesses: you have two midterms, each worth 25%, and a final worth 50% of your grade. The grade distribution is outrageous, in addition to mandatory discussion questions and section attendance."
99274,"Strengths: incredibly interesting subject matter (this is the reason to take the class). Also, Professor Latham is a great and engaging lecturer. Weaknesses: there is only so much one can do to make a 9 AM lecture fun, and the fact that Professor Latham never uses slides does not help matters when you're fighting to stay awake. Also, grading on midterms can be very arbitrary, and small mistakes can lead to a big drop in your grade."
99274,"Strengths - Professor Latham is a great lecturer and TFs did a good job with review sessions before tests. Weaknesses - no assignments, only tests, so there isn't much room for feedback on learning."
99274,Strengths: Latham is an amazing and accommodating lecturer!  Many topics covered with good depth Very interesting casebook + lots of interesting extra reading
99274,"Definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale! The professor was very engaging, and the topics we covered were very interesting. The material is very accessible, and there is not too much of a workload for this class. I also feel like the class was really well-organized (except for the final room change on the day of the exam). I just wish that discussion factored into the grade rather than the grade being entirely based on tests."
99274,no weaknesses
99274,Professor Latham is a wonderful lecturer. The exams are extremely fair and the content is very interesting.
99274,Very interesting material! Probably one of the few 9am classes I willingly went to.
99274,The course covers interesting topics and Dr. Latham delivers great lectures.
99274,"Great professor, thought-provoking content!"
99274,"This course was very engaging. Lectures and section were very interesting, so it made paying attention in class easy. I cannot think of any improvements to this course."
99274,"The course covers a lot of really interesting content and Professor Latham is a strong lecturer. The only weakness of the course is probably the exam structure, as sometimes the questions require answers and information from the class that don't seem to be that relevant or important. Some of the last lectures also lacked structure, and it felt like Latham went off on several tangents or was repeating information."
99274,"The material was so interesting and felt so relevant. However, lectures were hard to follow without any slides or main points to keep track of. But the TAs did a great job at review sessions making sure we knew what we had to study for the exams."
99274,Reading was too dense/long  Lectures were very engaging.
99274,"The strengths was how fascinating the course material was. I also thought Professor Latham was a terrific lecturerthe way he could express information concisely and in an organized fashion was truly admirable and inspiring.   The only weakness of this course that I can think of is the manner in which you are tested. There are two midterms and one finalthat is all that is factored into your grade. Further, these tests are less about critical thinking and more about the capacity to regurgitate information. I wish we had more opportunities to discuss the legal issues outside of merely what happened. In other words, there really isn't much room to formulate your own arguments regarding bioethical issues throughout the duration of the course."
99274,Strengths were lectures and the speed it was taught. Very easy to follow and build memory for
99274,Strengths were the discussion sections.
99274,"Strengths: Well-organized, very interesting course content, and Prof. Latham is amazing! Weaknesses: none"
99274,"strengths: comprehensive overviews provided, as well as granular pieces about specific court cases and verdicts and such. Everything mentioned throughout lecture was supported with case evidence or backed by the law which helped with my learning of the course material."
99274,"Strengths: great lectures, interesting content, moved at the best pace Weaknesses: none"
99274,"The section on Dobbs was a little confusing, but since this topic is so new, Im really glad the course covered it. Its awesome that Professor Latham tries to cover both the history and the most recent developments from this semester."
99274,"strength: latham is an amazing professor, great TAs as well, exams very fair and prof latham makes the content super super interesting no weaknesses"
99274,I really like how this class was structured. Latham's lectures are very interesting and understandable and the weekly sections were helpful as well.
99274,"The course is really great about telling you what you need to know. There are a lot of court cases that can be confusing, but the lectures and discussion sections are amazing at reinforcing the necessary information."
99274,"Strengths - recordings online, interesting lectures"
99274,Very good course as a whole not very many weaknesses.
99274,"Strengths: Professor Latham is an incredible lecturer and is able to keep a huge class engaged with a lecture without any visual aids at 9 in the morning, which is remarkable. He presents the information in a very digestible and organized way that makes studying for the exams much easier. Weaknesses: Some of the wording on the exams was unclear, which ended up impacting our grades for that midterm a lot. The final being worth 50% of the overall grade is a bit tough."
99274,"As someone whose course of study leads to a finals schedule filled with papers, I really appreciated the exam and participation based structure of the course. The course is inherently incredibly interesting, and the topics covered each week are relevant and thought-provoking. Professor Latham has the gift of being able to be a captivating lecturer at 9am. However, contrary to previous experiences I've heard about in this course, this year's iteration was at times incredibly and frustratingly disorganized, increasingly so as the semester went on. The first half of the course seemed to follow a well thought out and formulated structure, but the lectures grew a tad lackluster after midterm. In fairness, this may be a byproduct of the recent upsets in bioethics related law- much is fresh and still playing out- I suspect this concern will correct itself with time. The other concern of note was inconsistency and disorganization amongst TF's. To say nothing of the schedule-changing confusion at the beginning of the semester, some TF's seemed incredibly knowledgeable and invested in teaching, while others, not so much. Contradicting information was supplied in an exam review session, even covering matters that had absolutely no relevance to the course, the readings, or the lectures. It seems that people had greatly varying experiencing based on who their TF was."
99274,"One of the strengths of this course is the lecture format and Professor Latham's lecturing style.  One the weaknesses of this course is its grading format, which can be a bit too specific about term usage."
99274,"Professor Latham is the best lecturer I've had at Yale. The course is so interesting, and the readings are well-assigned. The exams were very fair, and I feel like I learned A TON just from attending lectures and discussion sections. The lectures were engaging and super interesting, and I thought the course material was very well thought-out and very relevant. I can't think of any weaknesses to this class."
99274,"Strengths: engaging lecture, well organized, informative, and not terribly stressful Weaknesses: none really -- it's relatively chill, and I'm glad it is"
99274,"The strengths of this course were that the material was always very interesting, and the discussion section was really helpful as a quick overview of the main ideas from class that week. I also think the review sessions and practice questions before the midterms and final were very helpful."
99274,Great course. Highly enjoyable.
99274,"The sections complemented the lectures very well; one of the biggest strengths was the way that all of the material was presented---a lot to learn, but manageable through the course"
99274,"This is an excellent course. Admittedly, there is a sizable (but entirely manageable) amount of reading but everything is connected and expands well on the lecture material. This is a great class if given the time it deserves and I really wouldn't make any changes or identify any weaknesses worth mentioning."
99274,"The strength is that you do not have to do the weekly readings, and you just have to show up for lecture or watch the recorded lectures. I think the main weakness is that you are only graded on the midterm and the final, which can be very stressful. I think section participation should account for at least 15% of the grade."
99274,Incredible professor
99274,"This course was honestly taught very well, and the TA were very well trained."
99274,"Great lecture format and fair assessments, section could be improved as it was often pretty irrelevant / not useful but I think that depends on the specific TF."
99274,No weaknesses this course is so great. Strengths are Latham-- he is a great lecturer and this class is just so interesting
99274,"Strengths: the lectures were well organized, and easy to understand. The discussions were thought provoking. The tests were fair."
99274,"this is a great course, but sometimes the information felt repetitive."
99274,"The content was incredibly interesting, and Professor Latham was an amazing teacher. Even though he stood and spoke for the entire hour and fifteen minutes every lecture, there was never a dull moment. Professor Latham knew what he was talking about and answered students questions with care. One weakness of the course was that Professor Latham never used lecture slides, so sometimes he was hard to follow, especially when sitting at the back. Another weakness was how heavily weighted the midterms and final exam were. I wouldve liked to see the weekly discussion posts and discussion attendance count for a portion of the grade as opposed to being things that could simply lower a students grade. I also think some of the readings could be omitted in the future as not all were directly relevant to the lectures."
99274,"Such awesome content, lectures were very informative, I actually appreciated having two midterms instead of just 1."
99274,Interesting lectures and material
99274,"strengths: engaging, relevant, organized, interesting"
99274,"Strengths: accessibly delivered material, great breadth and depth of coverage, high engagement"
99274,This course was amazing as an introductory course to the field of bioethics and is very engaging and involved with many current day relevant topics.
99274,Engaging lectures and straightforward exams
99274,I felt that the course content was interesting but were not as engaging.
99274,"strengths: organized very well, great TAs, great review system for midterms and final exam   weaknesses: professor does not provide power points so it makes it hard to organize information from the get-go"
99329,"Well organized, not super difficult if you show up"
99329,"Strengths: Stephanie was a great lecturer and made classes engaging and fun; weaknesses: the papers were a decent amount of work for a small part of the overall grade, and tests were pure memorization and often involved pretty niche details of experiments rather than focusing on understanding concepts of psychology. I also think more short answer questions instead of multiple choice would be better on tests."
99329,Engaging professor
99329,"Amazing course; love how it was structured around broad concepts and how we were encouraged to participate in word clouds even though it was a lecture. Although I wish I had gone to more office hours, I really didn't need to, because my TF gave me clear feedback on assignments and the instructions were always clear enough for me to do well independently."
99329,"The strengths are the amount of information you learn and I think the way it is presented it interesting and conductive to learning. However, there is a lot of content and sometimes it feels like we were rushing through material."
99329,"A strength of the course is how densely packed it is with information. I definitely feel much more knowledgeable on the subject. A weakness of the course is that it was delivered in a very rapid fashion and while I remembered the contents for the test, I feel like I'm less likely to retain it in the long term."
99329,Strength - engaging material Weakness - So much material
99329,"strengths- engaging, professor was amazing, well paced,  weakness- dense course, though that isn't much of a weakness for an introductory course"
99329,"strengths: very interesting things we learn (applicable). way class is taught is interactive (experiments, vids)  weaknesses: sometimes too much is expected to be memorized. Like a slideshow is showed for one sec and it is tested in depth"
99329,"Weaknesses: The feedback I received throughout the year was essentially useless, and grading is largely dependent on the TA you get."
99329,Good lectures
99329,"very organized, great pacing"
99329,"Exams were absurd. Could tell prof is really trying to shift the narrative away from intro psych being a gutty course, which made the workload even as someone w a strong bio background unmanageable."
99329,"Strengths -- lectures are pretty interesting and exams don't have any surprises on them. Weaknesses - some of the assignments didn't feel like they really added much to the course. Just felt like busywork (especially assignment 4). Also, it would have been nice if lectures were recorded, even if they were only released before the midterm for viewing."
99329,"Strengths: Professor Lazzaro is an absolutely fantastic lecturer. She's always incredibly enthusiastic about the topic, her slides make note-taking easy, she has student surveys in most lecturers to keep things interactive, and she literally knows almost every student's name (in a class with 300 students). Much of the subject matter is also quite interested, even if you're not interested in the finer details of psychology. Grading is also pretty fair and consistent. Weaknesses: The biggest weaknesses are all of those associated with a big lecture courseit's hard to stay engaged all of the time, and there's literally zero student discussion. Overall, though, there aren't many weaknesses."
99329,"Strengths: Good organization, clear feedback. Topics connected to everyday life, and made me see things differently as a result. Very interesting concepts! Weaknesses: none"
99329,"No strengths  Weaknesses: heavy exam weighting, low essay weighting, 4 essays involving 0 creativity and super boring"
99329,"This course was organized very well and all of the information was interesting. The lectures included lots of opportunities for student participation and also had lots of engaging videos/examples, so it was easy to pay attention and I often enjoyed class (which I don't say about most of my large lectures). However, the assignments felt more like busy work than necessary for understanding any course content and I found doing them to be boring or leaving me with a feeling of wasting time. I would like the assignments to be more in line with course content instead of entirely separate.   We were also not given our exams back unless we specifically requested it, which made it difficult to receive feedback.   Finally, grading took forever. Our first assignment and exam each took about three weeks to be returned to us. It's very difficult to gauge how well you're doing or how to improve on the upcoming assignments and exams without having the previous ones. There are so many teaching fellows, it would be great to get grades back quicker."
99329,The course could be improved by having recorded lectures in Canvas.
99329,engaging and interesting
99329,"This course had lots of very helpful PowerPoints that were always available on canvas, as well as readings out of class that expanded on the material and helped us understand it better. Office hours and TFs were available, which was especially helpful for our scientific journal searching and essay writing. I also think that having us participate in psych studies was a great way to experience a psych study on the side of the participant, rather than just reading descriptions in a textbook."
99329,"strengths were Prof. Lazarro, she was very good at teaching, lectures were interesting and engaging, and exams were reasonable; weaknesses were that lectures were not recorded, I believe the lectures should be recorded"
99329,I didnt like doing the outside of class participation experiments requirements
99329,"Little help from TAs, content was interesting but the exams focused on irrelevant detail"
99329,The strength was the lectures and how each class was structured. The weakness was the grading style.
99329,"strengths: lecturer was super interesting and so were the topics! weaknesses: a LOT of work (4 papers, 3 exams) for an introductory course. the sheer amount of work in this course added stress that took away some of the enjoyment of a learning a new discpline!"
99329,I thought the lectures were good but certain content could have been more directly emphasized so that we would know what to pay attention tothere was a lot of content.
99329,"Intriguing and interactive lectures, fascinating topics"
99329,"I think that the topics were fun, but there could have been more effort to relate concepts to larger significance. Some of it felt like the concepts were only learned for the tests and then forgotten."
99329,"Lectures were fascinating and often genuinely enjoyable. I found the homework/ testing to be a little dull (felt a lot like an AP class?), but I think this was likely a personal lack of interest in things like literature review."
99329,This class's grading was too harsh.
99329,Strengths: there were a wide variety of topics that were very interesting.  Weaknesses: I wish we spent longer on certain topics over others.
99329,I thought the course itself was quite boring and very unforgiving. Theres no recording of the lecture and the lecture hall was terrible for learning. There are also only 2 types of grades that actually matter: the exams for which review sessions are unhelpful and essays for which there is little guidance and the grading is subjective.
99329,The strengths of this course was the organization of the lectures and the detailed lecture slides. I was able to solidify my understanding of course concepts using the slides and supplemental articles.
99329,"Some interesting ideas, but not loads of depth."
99329,the content was very interesting. i loved the course. the tests were a little hard for me but overall the writing assignments were very interesting.
99329,"Strengths: a lot of assignments so grade is diluted, participating in studies is cool, exams are not hard if you do a bit of prep  Weaknesses: lectures get very boring, dont learn much new info"
99329,"Strengths - the style of teaching, organized by large questions rather than textbook style lectures. Very fun and interactive, and the research participation credits give a lot of insight. Weaknesses - the weighting components; the essays and research participation credits are not given enough weight despite the large amount of time many people spend on them."
99329,Strengths: very clear and interesting lectures. Fairly straightforward exams once you get the hang of it. Weaknesses: written assignments were tedious and grading was opaque.
99329,The exams were very hard. I would have like other assignments in addition to the papers to help reinforce what was discussed in lecture.
99329,This courses strength lies with Professor Lazzaro. Her lecturing was engaging. The weakness of the course is the excess in busy-work with regards to the research paper component.
99329,I liked the in class engagement. The exams sometimes emphasized small off handed comments in class so I believe if its going to be on the test it should be more emphasized in class.
99329,"Huge workload, no room for improvement, if you mess up even one little part of the course, you no longer have a chance for an A or A-. The biggest issue is that the tests focus on asking the material in a way that is not logically intuitive, or cannot be learned, just memorized from the class material. This way the course does not facilitate learning like CGSC 110, instead, it's a memory game."
99329,"Strengths: well-organized, wonderful instruction by Professor, engaging classes Weaknesses: lots of assignments"
99329,"Cool material, though could be a bit slow at times. Lazzaro and TAs are very helpful"
99329,"A central strength of this course is how the lectures are organized. I found each lecture to be engaging and packed with useful information. Since this course assumes no previous instruction in psychology, it nicely builds a foundation in the first few weeks that it continues to build on."
99329,Strengths: digestible lectures that cover broad topics Weaknesses: lack of transparency in regards to grading exams
99329,"Expectations were pretty straight forward. The assignments were a great way to become acclimated to scientific writing. The pace of lectures, however, was a little quick."
99329,The whole grade depended on the exam and there was not much margin for error.
99329,This class was very well structured and well taught. Loved it.
99329,"I loved the format of learning about different concepts through the lecture question, however I felt sometimes the material leaned too much into physiological aspects."
99329,"The course covered a wide range of topics and allowed me to see which ones I found most interesting, which I enjoyed."
99329,"Strengths: interesting lectures, interesting assignments Weaknesses: not a lot of guidance on how to write papers, harsh grading, lectures can be overloaded with information"
99329,I really enjoyed the organization of this course and thought it made sense for an introductory course.
99329,I liked how the course was structured by everyday questions; that and the moments of class participation really kept me engaged. I didn't think the course had any weaknesses.
99329,Some of the lectures were a bit tedious and long.
99329,The strengths were the interesting topics and material discussed. It could be improved if there were more studies available for the study credits.
99329,A strength of the course is the lectures. They are pretty interesting and provide examples of the concepts we learn in class that make the classes very engaging. A weakness is that there are few assignments so grading is pretty harsh if you are not careful early on.
99329,I really liked how the lectures were based around a question and found this format very engaging.
99329,Tests were difficult and covered obscured knowledge.
99329,The strength of the course is that the lectures were very engaging and the topics were interesting. The class gives a very good introduction to psychology concepts for pre-meds and people interested in psychology.
99329,Lecture recordings could be provided. There were times when I would have liked to be able to rewind back to hard concepts. Another weakness was that test feedback was not automatic and an appointment had to be made to go over the test. Extensive office hours are provided which is a huge strength.
99329,"One strength of the course is that the topics were very interesting, fun, and thought provoking, which made me very excited to learn the material. The lectures were also very engaging, and I liked how the essays built on each other."
99329,Strengths: incredibly engaging and entertaining lectures  Weaknesses: none
99329,Strengths are the teaching style and kindness from the teacher. Weaknesses are the disconnect of the assignments from the course.
99329,The lectures are clear and engaging. I feel like going to the lectures really helps with understanding and remembering the material. There are great examples of concepts and Professor Lazzaro is wonderful. I think the readings could be improved and that the research participation could count for a greater percentage of the grade because it is time consuming.
99329,The biggest problem with this course is that the tests are regurgitations and the assignments/essays are subjectively graded making it either really hard or really easy to receive a fair grade based on your TF with no room for appeal
99329,"This course had extremely exciting lectures, but simply too much writing to not be considered a WR credit."
99329,"Because there is no curve, yet it is such a large lecture, the grading is pretty hard. I felt some of my assignments were graded very hard and that it was hard to get a good grade. I am very good at psychology and am a cognitive science major so this kind of material comes naturally to me, and I felt the grading was nitpicky. The tests are fair but hard to ace, so an A is more difficult than necessary for an intro class."
99329,Exams being a big chunk of the grade made things overwhelming. Also the abundance of readings.
99329,lecture was too big and there was no room for engagement.
99329,The course does a good job in specificity but honestly sometimes I questioned that conclusions presented from some of the studies.
99365,I really enjoyed that there were pre-recorded lecture videos and actual live classes where we expanded on the topics covered and actually did practice examples.
99365,"The fact that this course was a flipped classroom was very un-engaging for me and did not help me learn. Truly, I do not think that I have absorbed any information this semester, I have just copied what was done in the example videos to my psets."
99365,I don't learn very well online so this course was not the best fit for me.
99365,I think the teaching fellows and the instructor are eager to answer questions in a multitude of ways which is really helpful. I think I ultimately did not engage with the course to the level that I needed to because of the asynchronous structure.
99365,Strengths - funny jokes and Prof. comes up with great mnemonics to help you remember class content; helpful office hours to review psets.  Weaknesses - a lot is covered... video lessons are very long; online flipped classroom format makes it very hard to stay engaged and take in content from videos
99365,"This course is taught online through lectures uploaded to Canvas, which is great for taking your time and truly learning the material."
99365,I think the course would be improved if it weren't taught asynchronously. I didn't necessarily see the gain of a flipped classroom and felt I would've been more engaged with a standard in-person mandatory lecture.
99365,"Going to in-person class was critical for me, so encouraging that more would be good!"
99365,The strength was definitely its format. The flipped classroom model was very effective for my learning.
99365,A huge strength is the pre-recorded videos that you can completely rely on just those for the entire course.
99365,Flipped classroom was nice in some ways since you didn't have to go to lecture in person but it became very easy to fall behind in class.
99365,I think its great that the course is taught as a flipped classroom. It allows students to learn at their own pace. I think it could be improved by adding more office hours
99365,The material was very interesting and very applicable.
99365,I think the course material is good for an introductory course and I thought the content was relatively interesting. I did not really like the asynchronous setup. It made it hard to stay on top of the lectures and felt as if I could have learned everything taught in the class on youtube. I would have preferred an in-person class where it was easier to stay engaged with the material.
99365,I did not like the mainly online portion of this course. I believe it held me back from learning to my maximum potential. I cannot name any strengths
99365,I wish that the in class times had been spent expanding on the lesson not repeating it
99365,"The strengths were the recorded lectures. It could be improved if worked solutions to the quiz questions were provided in the videos, especially questions that dealt with R."
99365,"The strengths of the course was that it gave me a very strong foundational knowledge of statistics and R coding. All of the flipped classroom lectures were easy to follow and the problem sets were very doable. The ULAs were extremely helpful during office hours when I had questions on the psets or course material. The one small weakness was that since I went to both the optional in-person classes and watched all of the flipped classroom videos, sometimes the in person section could feel slightly repetitive, but this was definitely not a large problem."
99365,"This is basically a Coursera online course. All the materials are taught flipped classroom, with pre-recorded Covid-era videos posted on Canvas. I can't believe that the only times that I ever had to interact with the professor were to sit for the midterm and final exam. Prof held open question time during what would have been lecture time, but I never felt it was necessary or even worthwhile to go, and I think this is a poor excuse for teaching an actual class at Yale. I have taken so many intro level lectures, including many in STEM, and there was nothing distinguishing this course from a non-Yale stats class that I could have found online for free."
99365,"The p-sets are manageable for the most part, and the flipped classroom allows for a lot of choice concerning engagement with the material and the time commitment week to week. However, it is very self-motivated and requires a lot of organization, which can be challenging if you fall behind."
99365,"Strengths - Professor was clear and concise, exams were fair, project was interesting   Weaknesses - Async made it sometimes hard to be engaged"
99365,Biggest weakness was it being fully online and the class time being at 9am. It should have a stronger in person component.
99365,"I liked the flipped classroom method, which meant that we could go into more detail and ask questions about the material during the lectures."
99365,"Strengths: this course is a great not-so-demanding math class. I took it because I was never a math student in highschool but wanted to try something new. It felt like an appropriate level of challenge without taking over my workload.  Weaknesses: second semester, the videos became really hard to keep up with. They became very long and more confusing than in the first semester. The material was not clearly linked."
99365,The strengths were that it was fairly straightforward and the exams were fair. The weaknesses was that the learning style was a bit difficult and the grading was very specific and a bit harsh.
99365,"strengths: videos available all times, office hours TFs were really helpful. weaknesses: videos available all times made engagement quite low"
99365,"Strengths: flipped format is amazing, allows you to go slower/faster, felt super comfortable with the coding portion as someone with very little coding background, amazing explanations, really fair PSETS, interesting, literally amazing Weaknesses: can't really think of any, could be a bit much at times but can always rewatch videos, etc"
99365,"It is well structured with the flipped classroom and the assignments are pretty straightforward. Reasonable expectations. I think because of the flipped classroom and somewhat ambiguous wording on PSETS, having more peer tutors and ULAs would be helpful"
99365,The videos asynchronous were a bit tedious
99365,"The homeworks were great; they helped me learn a lot and apply the concepts learned in class. I believe the exams need to be improved, however; there were questions about things not mentioned in class and we only got 1 practice exam; for comparison, all other STEM classes I've taken so far had at least 3 practice exams."
99365,The online class videos that were posted were very clear and helpful!
99365,A strength is the online resources available to use at your convenience. A weakness is the limited availability of office hours
99365,I learned a lot about statistical analysis and how to use statistics in the real world. I really appreciated how accessible and applicable the course material was.
99365,Strengths: videos are thorough and rewatchable at your own pace Weaknesses: Reverse classroom style is tedious and requires learning new material outside of class. Both the 9AM class as well as the reverse classroom style discourages attending in-person class.
99365,I did not like that the content was delivered electronically. It made me less engaged.
99365,I thought the course was very well-designed-- online videos + live coding in lectures + psets are good for reinforcement learning.
99365,"Asynchronous aspect of the class was helpful for courseload, but could lead to being lost in the course content at times"
99365,The online classes were very time consuming to watch. It was challenging to attend in-person classes and online classes; I could not find the time to do both. Office hours were greatvery helpful.
99365,"strengths were the homework and the quizzes that accommodated the videos, but this class might work better solely in person."
99365,"Great course, well structured."
99365,"Strengths: Very well organized, lots of office hours offered, and I really enjoyed the flipped-classroom set-up Weaknesses: Lecture quizzes often felt tedious/a lot of questions felt unnecessary"
99365,Strengths: flipped classroom Weakness: easy to fall behind
99365,I enjoyed the flipped classroom design as it let us work at our own pace. I think the lecture time though could have been used more productively than just recapping the videos and troubleshooting questions.
99365,loved that it was fully asynchronous and could do it on my own time
99365,"I personally did not like the flipped classroom approach. While the lectures were provided as recordings, I felt that the in person class time was a bit unorganized. It often felt like repetition at the beginning of class and less time spend on practice problems."
99365,One of the strengths of this class is that it is done via a flipped classroom. You can fit it better with scheduling conflicts because of this.
99365,"Strengths: very clear lectures and straightforward assignments. I appreciated that everything felt very clear and easy to follow. The flipped classroom nature also allowed for a more flexible learning environment, which I appreciated   Weaknesses: in-person classes would be more helpful with less review and more examples"
99365,There were many resources for students
99365,lectures are really boring but it's a pretty straightforward course
99365,"Topics were things I'm glad that I now know. The course was overall not very challenging, and I felt like the content was repetitive."
99365,"The strengths of this course is that everyone can go at their own pace when learning the content, since everything is taught in videos. Then, if you need extra help, you have the option to go to the live class. In the live class, we did a lot of practice problems which was very helpful for learning the concepts."
99365,Strength: ability to take class on canvas. in person office hours  weakness: multiple choice on exams felt too hard
99365,topics are gone over sooooo quickly and it is hard to catch up when you fall behind. also definitely not a solo course--- you'll NEED a friend or buddy to get through it even though it's asynchronous.  strength is that it is asynchronous so it is flexible with your schedule
99365,"Strengths: asynchronous format, clear and concise videos, accessible and kind TAs Weaknesses: 9am lectures made it less likely for me to attend the optional sessions"
99365,I had a lot of trouble with the fact that this class was a flipped model and think that I would've learned better if it had been fully in person.
99365,I really enjoyed the flipped teaching style and abundance of office hours available.
99365,"This was an overall wonderful introduction to statistics. For students who have never taken statistics or had a high school introduction, this was easy to get into."
99365,I found the lecture videos so long and getting into the weeds a bit which made me feel very lost
99365,Having videos be available for those who need to re watch lectures like myself is a strength. I cannot think of any weaknesses.
99365,"The flipped classroom format of this class allowed me to learn at my own pace and return to videos on any concepts I felt confused about. The videos were sometimes dry, and it was hard to stay motivated to keep up with all of the lessons. The lessons were sometimes too long. Ed Discussions was a super helpful resource, and I always had all of my questions answered very quickly. The TAs were always really helpful in office hours. I did not like the final project, and I don't think it was a helpful way to assess our understanding of the class material given the difficulty of finding a data set appropriate for the kinds of statistical analyses we had learned to run. Beyond that, it just felt like a repetition of the kind of work we did on PSETs. I wish the project had a slightly more specific assignment that asked us to extend our knowledge more. I also think the pacing got a lot quicker in the second half of semester, and it was hard to keep up with the more challenging material."
99365,"Weakness is that the professor was inaccessible outside of class hours. He held office hours right after class which was unhelpful when my schedule didn't match up. (our class ended at 10:15am, and most people have 10:30am classes, so office hours at this time is suboptimal). It is completely understandable that he cannot schedule a time that works for everyone. The issue though is that if we couldn't attend office hours with him, he was difficult to reach outside of class to schedule a time. He pretty much just said to ask the undergraduate TAs for help.   So I felt like I was at a state school with very little air time with the actual professor and pretty much only getting help from a junior or senior who might have taken his class before. Not a fan.   A major strength of the course is the format. He makes class attendance optional and provides lectures all online. which means there are SO many ways to be engaged in the course. It was not a gut though. Quite difficult actually, but I really appreciated having the option to look at the videos and go to the undergraduate TA when attending a 9am class was not feasible. I went to class 88% of the time and it really helped my learning, because that is how I learn best."
99365,I think a greater emphasis on in person class might be good.
99365,"I really liked the Ed Discussion board, as it allowed me to seek immediate feedback from the professor, staff, and other students. It was an incredibly valuable resource. The class' asynchronous design allowed me to digest the content whenever most convenient, but I ultimately prefer a typical classroom set up."
99365,Strengths: great job at reviewing previous material in class before staring new concept
99365,"The course provides students with multiple ""formats"" of learning (i.e. online lectures, in-person classes, office hours, P-sets), which allowed us to acquire the knowledge in the way which was best fit to our studying habits. Overall, I enjoyed the course and no significant weaknesses about its format come to mind."
99365,"Strengths: built-in review of learned topics, clarity of instruction  Weaknesses: monotony, professor's failure to make class engaging, flipped classroom model"
99367,Peer Grading and the insane curve was a huge weakness of the course.
99367,This course is great - I think sometimes the office hours can be concentrated towards the beginning of the week which can be difficult since psets are due at the end of the week.
99367,"Strengths: I enjoyed the homework assignments, well structured course, requires a lot of self discipline and time management Weaknesses: office hours were usually not super productive and took way too long to ask questions, need more TAs and in person office hours"
99367,Strength: It's quite easy.  Weakness: I learned nothing of value.
99367,Perhaps a bigger incentive to go to class would make it more engaging and educational
99367,Strengths were the organization of the course as well as the asynchronous model. There was also an incredible amount of support and office hours.
99367,Strengths: Easy to follow along and learn even without a Stats background  Weaknesses: Peer grading of the final report is kinda lame. Your entire grade feels like its determined by other students who read your final project you've spent weeks on for like 5 minutes. Kinda feels like JDRS's solution to grade inflation is to do a boxcox transformation and just hope the grade distribution becomes normal no matter who it affects.
99367,"I like JDRS's teaching style and everything was extremely well taught. But honestly, the class is just too easy. Homeworks are just straight copy-paste from the lectures notes and exams are take-home copies of the homeworks. There is very little conceptual challenge."
99367,Well Organized
99367,"A huge strength is its remote availability for students and its excellent organization of modules, deadlines, office hours, and overall assistance for whatever one would need for support."
99367,The ability to take the class asynchronously is a definite strength and allows freedom with the material. It is easy to watch the lectures and get through the material in a timely manner on your own schedule.
99367,This course taught practical skills well and I enjoyed the asynchronous format.
99367,format of the course was definitely a strength. i appreciated the flexible ways that the course could be taken.
99367,"It's really awesome that this course is offered both synchronously and asynchronously. I liked going to lectures because I felt more engaged, but it was nice to have the flexibility of doing the classes on my own time during challenging weeks. The hours and hours of office hours were also helpful!"
99367,The course was easy to follow and straightforward.
99367,"Final project is not designed well and peer grading is a poor way to do grades. Also, open book take home exams were unfair to those of us who follow the rules"
99367,"I think the asynchronous option for this class is a major strength, allowing students to take time with the content and understand it on their own schedule. There are also tons of office hours and resources available to help if you have questions. I can't think of a weakness of the course that wouldn't seem like nitpicking."
99367,It is incredibly atomized and really difficult to get an A since the curve is incredibly high.
99367,"It was very frustrating how almost every day I would receive multiple emails that a TF had rescheduled their office hours. There were also times when I didn't receive and email, showed up to office hours, and the TF never showed up. I think that TFs have to be held more accountable; if they are going to consistently have conflicts with their scheduled OH, they need to choose a different time."
99367,"Strengths: asynchronous lectures, manageable workload  Weaknesses: TAs moved their office hours last minute a lot"
99367,"Just know, because nobody told me, that the curve is absolutely terrible and that the final project is peer-graded, meaning you have no control over your grade. Also, while I have not received my grade back, I have been told that in years past people will receive different grades in the group despite having submitted the same project. For this course to improve, it should be curved less harshly and the peer-graded project should be better organized to avoid errors like this. Also, the curves are not made available, so we have no way of knowing our grade until after the course is completed and the grade is logged on SIS. I wish this were not the case and there were more transparency."
99367,Strengths are that it's all remote and it's sort of what you want to get out of it. Weaknesses: hard to stay accountable for the work.
99367,"Strengths: lots of resources about course topics (lectures, lecture recordings, prerecorded videos, notes, prewritten code, etc.), plenty of office hours, problem sets/exams were relevant and fair. Weaknesses: asynchronous nature made it so few people showed up to lecture, making it less engaging. Final project was handled poorly - spec was vague, and peer review is not a good method of grading at all."
99367,"The strength is definitely the asynchronous format. Having 5 classes already, it was very refreshing to not have to go to class for this one and just take all the lectures at my own time. JDRS is a great synchronous and asynchronous lecturer. He explains concepts well and also adds his own humorous touch which is very welcome for the material which can sometimes be a bit dry."
99367,"If you have no (or very little) prior background in Stats, you are not going to learn anything from this course (and it is not an easy A either because the curve is intense). Even though JDRS posts all the lectures from his intro stats class and everything is recorded, this class is not accessible whatsoever to someone with no stats knowledge (this is coming from someone who tried watching his intro stats vids and was still confused). JDRS means well but he is not a clear lecturer. You can cheat on all the PSets but the exams and projects will be tough if you don't know someone who has already taken the class."
99367,Good intro to r but not much engagement with material
99367,"strengths - content well organized through lectures and homework, lots of office hours weaknesses - final project is peer graded"
99367,can help me enhance the data exploration and analysis part in r  weekly homework workload sometimes can be high
99367,"Strengths: you don't actually have to do this course to take it. Weaknesses: you are in the dark on so much information, to get an A you have to get above a 98.5 or something, and the professor is supposedly obsessed with lowering your grade in the end without you knowing. Like you can get a 92 on every single assignment then earn a B+ or B in the class. Everything is not about grades, I understand, but you will not know if you are doing bad in the class until the very end. That is messed up."
99367,It's really great that JDRS has adapted the course so it can be completed completely asynchronously. The instructional videos are helpful and a great resource. I think that instructions on homework and exams were sometimes written in a confusing way that could be clarified.
99367,"weaknesses: all online, so it feels optional and is not very engaging"
99367,"I think the class notes and recordings were structured in a way that made it easy and accessible to understand the material, especially if you could not attend in-person lectures. I also feel that the teaching assistants were very helpful, however, there were some instances when the TAs would end their office hours early or not be as responsive to student questions on our Ed discussion board as well."
99367,"Strengths: JDRS is a super passionate educator who does an amazing job teaching students how to use R to code from the ground up. The class is very low-key, and you can definitely get by (despite what it says on the syllabus) without taking any statistics before this. Weaknesses: Honestly can't think of much. I think the only weakness I can think of is that the final project should not be peer-graded."
99367,It is so good. Could not love it more.
99367,"The lectures, notes, and office hours all provide a strong support system for learning. However, the grading system (especially for the final project) seems too geared to meeting a curve instead of rewarding good work"
99367,"I enjoyed the asynchronous format of this class as it meant that I could do my work right before the week began and adjust according to my schedule of the week. I also liked that there were videos + html + the r code itself, as I had several methods of accessing class notes. I also think that the PSETs were very well created to reflect the skills of the week that I had learned. My only suggestion is that the last project should not be based off peer grading as I have found them to be inaccurate."
99367,Accessible to anyone and the course can be taken however you like
99367,"I really loved how this course was asynchronous but had ample office hours to get live help. Overall I think it is a great introductory course, and good for people who want to learn a bit of statistics and programming. We dont go super in depth on any one thing, but I think this is a great model and format for an intro course. And there are ample resources to go more in depth on things if you want. There werent really any weaknesses other than a couple points in the semester where grading was a little slow, but the psets are straightforward so there shouldnt be many huge grade surprises."
99367,"Strengths: the recorded lectures are easy to follow, the homework assignments are a good length and are helpful in developing understanding of the content, and the exams were fair and good tests of knowledge. Weaknesses: the class can sometimes be very poorly organized, and because of how asynchronous it is, it can be very frustrating to get help. Office hours were frequently canceled or moved with just a few minutes' notice, assignments had instructions which were clearly a few years out of date, grading errors were frequent, etc."
99367,"I like that this course is fully online, as it definitely did not need to be in-person lectures. In fact, that would have been really hard to follow, given so much of it is coding. Also, having so many office hours available made the course really accessible!"
99367,The office hours and the recorded lectures were a major strength. The final project peer grade structure was a bit unclear and stressful.
99367,"As I'm sure others have pointed out, the grading system feels very arbitrary and doesn't reward hard work. Frankly, it's more about who you know than what you know. Many people I know relied completely on skeleton psets, exams, and even projects from last year which they got from their upperclassmen friends. As someone from a low-income high school who came into Yale without these connections, this made the class feel somewhat discouraging at times. While I learned a lot, I think it would have been nice to incorporate an in-person exam into the class alongside the other material so as to better test our knowledge."
99367,Async format was very very strong and I think it was very easy to access information from the course in relation to other stats course.
99367,Strengths: a lot of opportunities for outside help from a billion office hours each week Weakness: people tend to do nearly perfect in psets and on the exams so you need to be really on top of your work to make sure you get a good grade. ULAs will be picky so you need to give yourself a lot of time to check over your work to make sure you don't lose tons of points
99367,This course was extremely strong in providing students with the tools necessary to understand concepts at hand.
99367,Strengths  -Taught online so allows for flexibility   Weaknesses  -Reusing a lot of the code we saw in class
99367,online format meant you could rewatch all lectures.
99367,"I feel that the course is really accessible - lots of TAs and office hours, homework follows lectures decently well (gives students a chance to really consolidate skills), and having both recorded and live lectures was helpful. I do feel, however that the close is too big -- maybe splitting into smaller sections could be helpful? I don't feel that the grading for the final project should be left to students in the class -- if the purpose of this exercise is to add to students' understanding of the material, I feel that peer feedback on a first draft of the project could be helpful as opposed to the final version. I feel grades on the projects themselves should be determined by TAs/the professor instead -- potentially having a smaller class size with multiple sections will make this possible?"
99367,"The strengths of the course was that you could move at your own pace, whether it be ahead. However, a weakness was that there wasn't much engagement."
99367,"Strengths: Well-organized to facilitate student learning, even asynchronously Weaknesses: Too many people have connections in this classwhether its students who know the ULAs or people whose friends have taken the class beforethey are able to get PSET/Exam answers fairly easily as they do not change much year-over-year. This makes the class curve incredibly high, which is detrimental to students who are actually hoping to have a constructive class experience (i.e., you learn through mistakes but can't afford to make mistakes in a class where most people don't care about the content and use other people's work/answer keys to get ahead)"
99367,Weaknesses: ULAs elect skipping office hours. Class was extremely competitive and cutthroat and not a good learning environment sometimes.
99367,"Strengths- Asynchronous nature, can go at own pace Weaknesses- Homeworks were mostly a reiteration of lecture code"
99367,strengths: learning R weaknesses: developing strong understanding of underlying concepts
99367,Strengths was that it taught me how to code in R and the Psets were just like the lecture.  Weakness was that the final project was graded by peers
99367,"The TA's and professor sometimes did not respond to emails.  The overall structure of the course was well organized, especially the asynchronous option."
99367,Strength : the class lea tires are organized and helps with homework. Weaknesses : a little bit unorganized.
99367,"The asynchronous nature made it manageable, and constant office hours were helpful. However, guidelines for the final project were unclear."
99367,"Strengths accessible, well taught, easy to learn from the material and psets Weaknesses pace varied"
99367,"The class seems well equipped and managed. The turnover time for homework grades should be looked into. Also, proper training should be given to the ULAs; the way they grade is so bizarre, always making mistakes here and there."
99367,"Easy format in that everything can be asynchronous, but I found my engagement very low as a result. Grading seems based largely on ability to meet rubric guidelines rather than think originally."
99367,"- Exams and HW were very stressful as you trying not to lose points. Since everyone does well, and bascially gets a near 100 on the exams and problem sets, if you want an A in the class you need to make sure you are perfect. So most of the time I was stress about not losing points rather than learning statistics. - Overall, homework was very well designed though and exams were extremely fair testing you on what you learned on the homework."
99367,"Strengths: Straightforward assignments and weekly sets, high quantity of office hours Weaknesses: Many! Low quality of office hours, many TAs will purportedly hold office hours, only to not show up or cancel them last minute. Cheating is widespread in this class, causing grades to be ridiculously inflated and causing grade deflation. Professor JDRS, despite his charisma onstage, is often unresponsive or reluctant to help - I emailed him several times to ask for extensions among other things, only for him not to reply to a single one of them. Weekly psets can become a nuisance, with little room for error. Also, office hours can bring out the worse out of people, both peers and TAs. TAs are often incentivized to be unhelpful and hold their office hours only after pets were due, and classmates often rudely cut the line, specially on zoom. Sometimes I tried to be courteous and let my peers who came to the office hour first ask their questions first, only to be taken advantage of and have other classmates skip me, despite me coming beforehand. And the group project at the end is very brutal. It seems quite unfair to have our peers grade our final project, as it incentivizes harsh grading. Moreover, even if your do an excellent job on your section of the project, if the rest of your group doesnt put in their fair share or do their portions of the project with as much vigilance, you can be hosed."
99367,"I liked the asynchronous nature of the course and the zoom office hours. One weakness is that a lot of times, questions on Ed Discussion go answered."
99367,"Strengths very resourceful with many many options to participate in the course.   However, I dont think some undergraduates should be TAs, they sometimes guided me incorrectly."
99367,"Strengths: that the class could be taken in a number of ways, extensions were easy to get, ULAs were helpful Weaknesses: office hours kept changing, it didnt feel as consistent as it needed to be."
99367,Strengths: multiple ways to complete material. many office hours. many ways to succeed in course.  Weakness: TAs frequently move their office hours last minute
99367,"Since its a course thats been taught for many years, I liked how structured and organized the syllabus was. You can go to class if you want to in person, or you can watch recordings in advance and proceed at your own flow."
99367,"The asynchronous format of the class was amazing, the video modules and r files were so clear and helpful, and all the ULAs were so great. My goal was to learn how to code in r, and I achieved it! However, the final project peer grading system was absolutely ridiculous and I hope JDRS changes it going forward. My group lost points due to multiple careless graders forgetting to fill out rubric sections, and JDRS dinged everyone's grade two points, indiscriminately, because project grades were ""too high."""
99367,Strengths: Learning how to program in R. Being more confident in stats. Weaknesses: The way the final project is graded seems a little disorganized. It would be nice to have the project due a week earlier to give us more time to grade.
99367,"I love that this course was taught asynchronously. One weakness was how the final project is graded. because it is peer graded. For one of my peer grades, they forgot to fill out sections of the rubric causing us to lose points where we didnt have to"
99367,"Class is designed very well to facilitate learning, asynchronous style also lets you learn at your own pace."
99367,"Take it at your own pace, lots of office hours offered"
99367,"This course has an outstanding instructor who really makes the lectures engaging. There are many different ways to get the lecture material, either in-person or on Canvas. This flexibility helps you out when you are busy. Lastly, the final project grading turned out to work okay, despite everyones concerns about peer grading. It seems much improved from previous years. I really loved the course and learned how to program in R. It had no weaknesses."
99367,"Strengths: can be taken asynchronously, lectures are very entertaining (JDRS is upbeat), many office hours. Weaknesses: psets and work is passed around, class curve can be brutal, TAs are always cancelling or postponing office hours with little notice."
99367,Love that it is online and you can go at your own pace. Also love how accesible TAs are.
99367,"I like how flexible class is, with the asynchronous and synchronous content. There are a lot of resources offered to students to do well, like extra content on Canvas and plenty of office hours."
99367,"The assignments are quite hands-on and maximize learning, and multiple options for taking the course asynchronously make it possible to fit it into an already busy schedule. One drawback, however, is that there isnt much interaction with other students or the professor and in-person class attendance is very low. The many hours of office hours each week are great."
99367,"Strengths - very organized, all materials laid out in the beginning of the semester, clear lectures Weaknesses - ED discussion not responded to frequently, so many questions go unanswered"
99367,"I thought the online video format was outstanding. Normally, I really dislike pre-recorded lectures, but JDRS clearly put a lot of time and effort into making the video modules clear and concise. Watching the lectures online was hugely compatible with viewing R-scripts on my computer at the same time, and I really enjoyed the extra flexibility to watch lectures when I wanted or to rewatch them to clarify a confusing point while completing the homework. I think this course could be improved by spending a little more time working with ggplot2."
99367,"Strengths: Course organization. Knowing which modules should be completed in what weeks, which modules were required to be used in each homework, and having resources for support on coding (although I did not make the best use of this resource). Pre-recorded lectures made this course a very flexible one to take in addition to other courses at Yale which arent as flexible. As an intro stats course, it was very helpful to have it in such a format (as Im sure is the reason why many take the course!) Improvements: The fact that the problem sets are all strikingly similar to past iterations of the course and thus all the scores are ridiculously high is not great as it punishes those who dont compare answers or seek past resources for advice on how to get all the marks on every pset or midterm."
99367,Strengths: Good for busy schedules Weakness: quick
99367,"I liked the flexibility of the course. I attended most lectures in person, and I thought professor Reuning-Scherer was a great lecturer, but I also appreciated having the option to work ahead or to watch a recording of the lecture after the fact if I had to miss the live lecture for some reason. The TFs were all incredibly helpful and I appreciated the flexibility of having so many different office hours and ways to get help. Some aspects of the class that I might change were the pace of the first few units (I had never coded before and I found it a really steep learning curve, with some basic coding procedures never explicitly explained) and the structure of the homework assignments. Because the homework assignments paralleled the lectures so closely, it became relatively easy to copy and paste code from the r markdowns from lectures without really learning the material. While I appreciated being able to do that in the midst of a busy schedule, in retrospect I think I would have learned more if forced to do more thinking myself."
99367,the grading was inconsistent across tas
99367,The approach to teaching is strong but the final project could work better
99367,"This course is a great way to learn R and is very thorough in terms of the concepts that are taught. There is also a lot of support from the professor, TFs, and peer tutors each week. The biggest weakness of this course is the grading. It often seems like the course is built against us as students and they do not want us to do well. TFs will deduct points from homeworks (which is 50% of the final grade) in very arbitrary ways, so you may get a lot of points off for something where as other students got no points off for the same mistake. A lot of the deductions are also for small things that are unrelated to how well you understand R (such as the color you chose for your plots or the size of your graph titles). The worst part of this course is the final project, which is peer graded and therefore very arbitary. You may have fulfilled every requirement on the rubric but still get a C just because it was not graded carefully by the student who it was assigned to. Overall, it seemed that the focus was more on deducting points from anything less than perfect rather than promoting student learning. I found myself spending hours on assignments even after they were completed just making sure there were no small mistakes."
99367,Online and could rewatch the lectures. Lot of assignments but very helpful. Lots of TA.
99367,"Strengths is that the class is very organized, but weakness is that having a hybrid system can make it easy to fall behind."
99367,"This is a course where you get out whatever you put into it. If you watch all the lectures, take time to digest the class notes, and spend time perfecting your homework, you can come out with a pretty good understanding of R. This is a very well-designed course, and if you put in the effort, you can learn a lot. That said, there is little accountability to actually do those things, so you need to be self-motivated throughout the class. One additional weakness is that the class focuses a lot more on perfection and attention to detail than on understanding the material and the statistics behind what we are doing. Also, the grading of the final project is absurd, and I really disliked the peer grading/comparative nature of the grading."
99367,"The only improvement I would suggest are optional simpler coding exercises in addition to the weekly home works. I felt that the instruction in the course was very effective and that I learned a lot from the assignments, I would have liked additional reinforcement of the material to the homework that was not as time intensive or difficult in order to master the syntax."
99367,"I really love all of the office hours and resources provided; however, I did not like how many of the ULAs often cancelled office hours last minute."
99367,"The class is organized okay for its size, but definitely need more ULAs or having ULAs be more on top of their grading. Have had many mis-graded PSETS and unanswered questions in ed discussion"
99367,"This course really facilitated student learning. There were multiple formats in which we could take the course, and there were office hours all throughout the week. The homeworks were designed to really help us practice the material."
99367,"The Canvas page has lots of resources. JDRS is a great professor. Since I took the class asynchronously, I attended to online lectures instead. The lectures are not painfully long, so the workload for this class was manageable. This was good since I was taking five credits this semester."
99367,"Strength: The pre-recorded lectures were very well made and I found that resource incredibly helpful as I could always go back to them if I didn't understand part of the problem set. I also appreciated the team aspect of the final project. Weakness: I would appreciate the addition of a document that includes many of the most important R functions used across the semester. I know that Oracle has a document with many R functions, but having a sheet to use to remember syntax would be helpful."
99367,"strengths: interactive problem sets and lectures, great professor, and flexible schedule."
99367,The course is difficult since it is online but the office hours were amazing.
99367,A strength of the course was the amount of clear instructions given in office hours and helpful videos.   One weakness was the abrupt cancellations of office hours.
99367,"the course is very flexible in the way that there are several formats to attend the class, but they are all very effective ways to help and support us in the learning processes. Thank you!"
99367,One thing I like is that the course can be accessed online.
99367,"Strengths: the 'hands-on' learning by using real datasets from the beginning; the variety of datasets/examples which can appeal to students with very different interests; the engaging way in which JDRS delivers the class; the option of attending the live lecture or checking the pre-recorded videos if you are unable to attend live at some point or you want to review some of the content.  Weakness: there is a lot to cover in this course, so sometimes it went too fast, but I guess it is a trade-off between going fast and covering all important things vs. going slower and not getting such depth in the content. Also, it is good to have lots of office hours but sometimes they were all clustered around certain times of the day, and then there would be a whole chunk of the day when no one was holding office hours, so it would be better if they were more spread out, as it was with the Intro Stats class.  To improve: although I understand there were many students taking this class, it would be good to get grades and feedback on homeworks before taking our exams, as it is always good to see exactly what we got wrong and why, rather than just checking the solutions once they are made available. Another thing would be if the TAs could provide more prompt responses to the questions in the Ed discussion forum, as most questions were about homeworks and exams and there was a deadline."
99368,This course was great! The remote format was very helpful and allowed many students to develop R skills in a course without enrollment cap.
99368,"strengths: async so i would take this class as a 5th class or if you have other classes that need more of your attention. a few of the psets were just copying and pasting code so it wasnt horrible. lots of office hours and ULFs! weaknesses: bc its p easy, everyone does well which kind of screws up the curve. you probably want a 95+ in the class to get an A. i also think the psets don't change year to year so some people may also have psets from the previous years that they are copying (further screwing up the curve)."
99368,Great modules
99368,"I think the course covers a lot of content but does not really force students to engage with it on a deep enough level to fully grasp the concepts. Homework only really requires students to find the relevant piece of class code and make a few edits to make it work in their code. Although more work, I would prefer more homework like the final project, where students are given less direction and have to understand the methods well enough to know how to apply them."
99368,Class recordings are much appreciated.
99368,prefect
99368,Async courses make my schedule nicer
99368,"The statistics materials covered in this class is really comprehensive and I am fairly confident that I can tell meaningful things from every dataset I may acquire using a plethora of tools. There's a nice focus on the strengths and limitations of each tool and in which occasions they may be applicable.  This class is too big and there's really no sense of engagement. Everyone's just doing their own stuff. The office hours are not easy to keep track of and keep changing. Towards the end of the term, few ed discussion questions get answered.  You learn coding ""the statistician's way""if you are more well-versed with CS and takes technical terms very seriously, you will be deeply saddened by some of the misconceptions in class (like how some regex syntaxes work, or what ""objects"" are, etc.) You walk away with the knowledge of producing templates of R code but you don't really learn R as a language.  Because the course is so undemanding, the curve gets really harsh and in the end many starts worrying about their grades. Your grades will not be correlated with how much you know the material because the scores are all taken off from minute details like text running off the graph boundaries."
99368,"Strength - JDRS is an excellent prof and makes the course very accessible. You can seamlessly transition between in-person, synchronous online, and asynchronous online with no trouble at all.  Weakness - The TAs and ULAs are terrible about office hours. So so many of them get moved or cancelled at the last minute, sometimes without any announcement. Don't bet on office hours occurring when they're scheduled."
99368,"I think the class is structured so that you really don't have to learn anything. You don't have to go to lectures, you can just copy from class codes for psets, there's only take-home open book exams and final projects. It's really chill, but unless you take initiative, you don't really learn much."
99368,"Strengths - Flexibility of delivery, the prof is really good Weakness - Limited feedback on problem sets"
99368,too much workload
99368,"The worst thing about the course, is that no matter how well you learn the content or how well you do on the assignments, the amount of people that do well is way too high for you to get a good grade"
99368,It was really hard to keep myself accountable with watching lectures and going over class material.
99368,"Bruv, I know you want the whole remote thing, and I think it's great because otherwise I couldn't have taken this course. But it is really really really really hard to actually commit to a fully remote class. STUDENTS READING THIS: GO IN PERSON!!!  strengths: very clear lesson plans that teach you exactly what they say they will. I appreciated JDRS' silly little jokes. project is really fun. weaknesses: difficulty to stay locked in remotely. no actual incentive to learn the math (other than love of the game) both strength and weakness: Psets and exams are very much just tests of can you replicate what we did in class and you're given the notes to do that. So they're pretty trivial."
99368,"If there were more instructions provided for the final project, it would be helpful for students to better understand how to complete the project and the peer review process."
99368,"This course had many weaknesses. I feel like I just got through this class rather than feeling like I truly grew as a statistics student, so I am disappointed by this. I think the asynchronous format could become more interactive rather than solely being videos so that students actually feel like they are learning while consuming class content."
99368,"Strength: Learning to code in R, asynchronous  Weakness: A lot of homework"
99368,The best part was gaining practice and code from class and psets that I can use for my research. This class feels very useful. I appreciated the flexibility in timing. The main area for improvement is making grading more about mastery of concept and less about attention to detail.
99368,"The biggest strength of this course is that the instructor explains the concepts very well. I also really like that this course offers various formats; students can take it in-person, via Zoom, or through previously recorded videos. I don't really see any weaknesses in this course. Great class!"
99368,"Strengths = asynchronous, many resources to go back to for the psets, office hours that are helpful and accessible for the most part.  Weaknesses = high work load, there is a pset every week that it sometimes becomes difficult to work on it AND go to office hours to get questions answered. Sometimes there are exams and psets due around the same time.  I think it could be improved by giving more time in between the p sets. For the asynchronous option, I also think that the videos could be more concise because it takes a lot of time to go through."
99368,"I think this course is very good because it offers flexibility for students to learn at their time convenience. However, given this course can be fully remote, the ed discussion board becomes very important in helping students out. There are quite some time that students post questions about concepts or homework in ed board but the TA did not response within 3 days. This definitely puzzled me given there are so many TA for this course."
99368,"Strengths: asynchronous so it's really flexible and can do the work on your own time, workload is not overwhelming. Weaknesses: TAs / ULAs can be pretty slow in answering questions on Ed. They are also quite slow in grading which was really stressful at the end of the semester when I didn't know my exam 2 grade so I CDF'd the class but found out over a week later that I ended up doing well on it....also the grading is very very picky."
99368,"This course was offered entirely asynchronous; while JDRS is a fabulous professor and I am certain the live lectures were engaging, being able to stop the recording and have the code on your computer all at the same time was really helpful."
99368,"I think the asynchronous format and overall structure of the class is fantastic, but some kids abuse it since they can copy off of last year's p-sets. I wish that psets changed more from year to year to favor students who actually went to lecture to learn."
99368,"This class is a very solid introduction to R. It wasn't always exciting, but I learned a lot and am much more comfortable with the R platform."
99368,"I like that the professor offers the option to take it asynchronously. It was very easy to keep up with the assignments without having to make it to every 9 AM class. One weakness of the course was that the TAs often delayed their office hours last minute, making it more difficult to connect with them."
99368,"Strengths: Helped me quickly gain understanding of R and how data can be transformed, parsed, etc. major weakness : the grading system and extreme down-curve since everyone does well in the class."
99368,Strengths: Very interesting material. The videos were really helpful. Weaknesses: The pacing of the course was a little too fast. The final project was also a mess.
99368,The strengths are how organize the class was and how everything felt doable because of how much support there was from office hours.
99368,It was way too asynchronous for me. I like in person and that was hard.
99368,Strengths: I liked that the course was asynchronous because you could learn at your own pace. It made the workload very manageable.  Weaknesses: I don't think that the teaching staff was very responsive on Ed discussion. I also did not like the grading system for the final projects.
99368,add some labs
99368,"The grading of the final project was very problematic. I understand the class is large and there is the expectation to get final grades out in time, but peer grading the final project is not the best way to cumulatively assess how much we learned the semester. The rubric was like a checklist of items needed to be included on the project, but did not truly assess knowledge of correct biostatistical application. Furthermore, some classmates very obviously did not read through the entire final project and so did not give an accurate grade."
99368,Strengths: thorough; covers breadth of topics. Weaknesses: unengaging at times; lack of variation in work.
99368,"It's very flexible in terms of schedules and really light workload, but I doubt if I would still remember things I learned in the class. A lot of homework were just copying lecture codes and I did not find that helpful in developing one's own way thinking."
99368,Strengths: helps you learn a programming language if you put in effort Weaknesses: asynchronous nature and the fact that the psets are the same year to year means that it's super easy to stop doing any of the work and fall really behind
99368,I think the flexibility of this class is amazing. All of the lectures are pre-recorded and the live ones are recorded as well. I wish that the live class took place during the 4-5:15pm slot instead of at 9am in Marsh because I think more people would attend in the afternoon. There are also tons of office hours throughout the week and the problem sets are very straightforward. Weaknesses are the live class time and the lack of clarity regarding final project grading.
99368,super good
99368,"This course had a completely asynchronous option, which was useful if I ever needed to skip in-person lectures. The homework assignments are very closely tied to lecture material, which was a strength as I was able to learn how to apply what I learned. One weakness was that it was difficult getting access to help from course staff during some weeks."
99368,"absolutely no integrity of the students in this class, the peer grading system for the final project is horrible, class size should be smaller w multiple sections to encourage actual learning, some pset grades were posted super late not enough time to make adjustments for next homework"
99368,"The course being asynchronous was very helpful at times, at others though it felt a little disjointed as I didn't really meet in person with anyone for the entire semester."
99368,Strength well organized Weakness: not much engagement
99368,"Totally remote, easy A but you learn nothing and they take off points for the dumbest things because otherwise everyone gets 100"
99368,"Strengths: well-organized, interesting content, lots of help available"
99368,Structured well.
99368,JDRS is a goat professor
99368,"The homework is too much, even though they are very good practice materials."
99368,Strengths: great introduction to R Weaknesses: not really many opportunities for learning. Most of the homeworks involved using code directly from lecture. Some more exploratory assignments like the final project would have been helpful for more real world applications. Very petty and inconsistent grading.
99368,"I like that the class is fully remote. It helps students keep up at their own pace. The homeworks keep you in check. However, I think there should be one or two late day exception. Everything with regard to homework submission seemed to be so strict"
99368,strength: great professor and learnt a lot in R
99368,"Strengths: Very flexible (asynchronous)  Weaknesses: Honestly since I didn't have a super strong stats background in the past, I kind of just copied the code from class notes into my assignment. I don't feel like I gained a super deep understanding of stats."
99368,"Honestly, the final project was hectic and the peer grading made it terribly disorganized. However, JDRS handled everything with grace."
99368,"The strength is that JDRS is a great professor and there is an option for students to take this asynchronously, which allows for maximum flexibility. The weakness is that it is often difficult to engage students who are asynchronous when there are pre-recorded lectures already."
99368,"Weakness: too much of a big class. Very difficult to know what is going on towards the end. Especially there are a lot of blindspots in the final project grading. Since there are no in person exams, you dont really try to learn things."
99368,"The lectures are always interesting, as are the examples. It is asynchronous which gives you full autonomy over when you do your work."
99368,The remote format really helps this course. The code and lecture slides are very well made. Psets are legit: great at helping learning.
99368,"Strengths: indepth knowledge and exploration of data analysis skills  Weaknesses: although it strives to be an intro class to R programming, it's somehow difficult to understand the code walkthrough because the instructor doesn't do a good job of explaining why some things happen in the code. At most times I felt like I just copied over code from class rather than do it myself"
99368,Strengths: a lot of office hours Weaknesses: too high proximity between final assignments
99368,"Strengths: This course is highly flexible as it can be done entirely asynchronously. There are a multitude of resources for help (the Zoom office hours were a little unpredictable for my tastes, but the Ed board has been a lifesaver). It offers a comprehensive introduction into working with data in R, and Professor JDRS uses engaging examples to illustrate the concepts. Weaknesses: The marking scheme for the psets is unclear at times - points that werent asked in the question (e.g including titles) might be deducted anyways. The final project peer grading led to frustration and unfairness both on the side of the grader and the one being graded, since we were only able to see the report and not the source code."
99368,"strength: professor was great, no exam but a lot of homework, which I think gained me a lot of coding practices"
99368,"I really liked how there were a handful of ways to engage with lectures and office hours. I watched lecture videos so I could pause, and reviewed notes, which is a system that worked well for me. I found that in-person office hours were the most helpful to me, but I liked that there were different options for asking questions."
99368,"Strengths: You do come out of it with a working understanding of R, although it is not very in-depth ie. you don't always know why an error occurs and you do rely heavily on example code.   Weaknesses: The class works best if you already have the stats theory. It is more difficult if you are looking at these stat theory elements for the first time ever."
99368,none
99368,"I think this course is strong in its options given to students for in-person and asynchronous, as well as resources in beginning stats if there are topics you need to brush up on."
99368,Nice
99368,"It is completely asynchronous if you want, which always poses the issue of engagement and discipline. While I was fully responsible for that, I didn't always engage the material as much as I needed to. I found the PSETS to be very reflective of what we learned in class, and I liked that there was constant help available due to TA's/office hours. Sometimes, the TA wouldn't show up to office hours. It'd be helpful to have clearer checklists for common stats processes/questions to help us understand exactly what we need to include in our homework (especially on explanations)."
99368,excellent
99368,"Strengths: Class format, assignment directions, grading.  Weaknesses: TA office hour consistency."
99368,Weaknesses: ambiguity following the final project and how it would affect grades
99368,I think that it shouldnt be asynchronous and should be taught at a later time with sections because it can be very confusing. Also the grading curve is really rough so if you are doing this course and need to worry about gpa i would recommend dont take this class as its curve though he doesnt tell you until like the last week of class is very rough and its really hard to get an A in this course if you dont basically get a perfect score on everything
99368,"I appreciated how straightforward the homeworks were and how they connected directly to the lectures. However the peer grading for the final project seemed really arbitrary and seemed to only work to make the curve. Also, the TFs frequently canceled or changed their office hours."
99368,"I thought the HW was directly related to the concepts learned in lecture. I liked the flexibility of the class and lectures. I also appreciated all the office hours that were available to us.   I thought the grading was sometimes arbitrary and expectations were unclear, so more transparent rubrics or expectations would be helpful. Also the office hours schedule was never consistent and TFs would often postpone or cancel with little to no warning."
99368,"The strength of this course were the plethora of different strategies which students may use to learn in this course. As someone who does not wake up for 9am lectures, the ability to watch pre-recorded lectures at my own pace was incredibly conducive to my learning in this course. A second strength involves the plethora of resources available to help you succeed in this course, including plenty of office hours each week. The major weakness of this course involved the final project. It felt like the guidelines were scrapped together at the last minute without much thought. Rather than receiving a grade from the Professor on this assignment, we were instead peer-graded by three students in the class. I do not think this is all that fair as students have highly differing viewpoints for what constitutes a good final project, even with a common rubric, and thus there is no baseline for comparing how well a student actually did on a given project. As this class was incredibly systematized in a seamless fashion up until this point, this last minute project chaos was disappointing."
99368,The class is good at teaching R and easy to complete.
99368,"I really appreciated the flexibility of the course with the available module videos, live captures, slides, and r markdown files all made available. They were very useful to look back on as a reference and helped me reinforce some of the topics I needed more time on. All the available office hours were another great thing since you really need a TF or the professor when doing the problem sets. Sometimes the problem sets felt inconsistent with the module it was supposed to follow so I had to rely on the internet for solving the problems required. I think there could be an improvement in including more of what is in the module in the problem sets could help students learn more from the actual course than relying on the internet."
99368,"Very dense homeworks that address the material well, but the homework questions are some times ambiguous, and if possible more time allowed for the final project would be helpful."
99368,I think this course is already really good. There are plenty of materials and resources available to facilitate learning.
99369,"The ""above and beyond"" grading component was highly arbitrary and often inconsistent. I felt like I was often guessing at what needed to be done to get full points on the problem set beyond what was actually specified or asked by the question."
99369,"Strength: JDRS is incredible, lots of office hours and support, the class material is very do-able and not hard, you get to learn on your own pace/asynch Weakness: a lot of it is self-motivated and you should be on top of your own work (it's easy to fall behind and hard to catch up), and the engagement with the course is low (think of it as an online course), but honestly I enjoy that."
99369,"I really liked how this course explored many different ways to analyze data, especially since many of these methods are important to social sciences. However, I found that the extremely theoretical explanations of the statistical/mathematical processes lost me greatly throughout the lectures. I also wish there was a comprehensive review of all of the different methods and when they're used. The change in the grading system (where to get 100/100 points on an assignment, you have to demonstrate that you went ""Above and Beyond"") was also extremely confusing, and neither the TFs nor the course manager could provide good clarification on this."
99369,"Keep this course in its current asynchronous format forever. It is so well-organized for student learning, and functions so much better in this format than it would as an in-person unrecorded lecture. However, I wish we got more feedback on our homework many of my projects got points off for not going ""above and beyond"", but still didn't get any suggestions for improvement."
99369,"Strengths - super thorough, hybrid structure Weaknesses - I sometimes felt like the analysis methods got really complex and that I was mainly just learning how to code them -- I'd have liked to explore them in more detail"
99369,"Strengths: very organized, great lectures, lots of office hours, JDRS Weaknesses: i wish the powerpoint slides were a bit more organized, TA's grade very differently"
99369,Strengths: multiple ways to take; great and thorough class materials.
99369,Hard to really give it a lot of time and attention because can do everything pre-recorded- there's a beauty and weakness to that model I think.
99369,"Would have appreciated more one on one time in office hours - due to the large nature of the course, often spent most office hours waiting to ask my question (even if I arrived early) and feeling rushed."
99369,"The hybrid format is great and it's very useful to be able to use our own data for problem sets. However, the course spends a lot of time on the details of various stats programs, which becomes a bit of a time sink when your preferred program isn't being discussed."
99369,"Loved the asynchronous format and options, very accessible. Did not like the project peer grading, really pits students against each other in an unnecessary way."
99369,More forced engagement would be better
99369,There is a lot of material present in the class that is helpful and learning it through multiple programs.
99369,"JDRS is an amazing lecturer - probably the biggest strength of the course. However, I wish we went more into the actual statistics instead of just running R code."
99369,Engageing
99369,"The workload is manageable. Particularly enjoy working in groups for both homework and final project as I feel like I learn more from discussions. Even though in depth understanding of the mathematics lying behind the different methods are difficult, they are not required to do well for the course. I can watch lectures at home but have a lot of office hours to ask questions. There is no weakness."
99369,"I thought the assignments and project were very engaging and the flexibility and accessibility of lecture attendance was very nice. I thought the grading was weird and confusing (this was the first year it was altered, so I guess it makes sense), which made me constantly unsure what my grade actually was."
99369,"Given that the course could be taken entirely asynchronously, I thought it was incredibly flexible to the individual preferences of students and the office hours allowed for a high degree of assistance. No real recommendations for improvement."
99369,strengths: the organization of the course weaknesses: could get timelier feedback; grading other students' final projects seems prone to inaccuracy and bias
99369,could cover more coding part
99369,"The grading needs to be fixed. The professor can't continue to avoid changing the nature of the assignments (which takes work) by finding new ways to move the grade distribution to where he wants it post hoc. The whole ""grading out of 90"" thing was ridiculous and misleading. Also the code is basically just given to you for every assignment and you just have to copy-paste it and apply to your own data, which is kind of dumb."
99369,Different formats of taking this class are amazing. Interesting professor to learn from. Technical knowledge but reasonable arrangement of the information.
99369,"Hard to engage given the asynchronous format and group project. Possible to get by doing very little actual work.  GRADING WAS HORRENDOUS. So unclear the entire semester how grading works. Every homework is graded out of a baseline 90/100 points, with 10 extra points awarded for ""Above and Beyond"" work. Some TAs told me the ""Above and Beyond"" section did not factor into my grades, others did. The final project is also graded horrendously. The comparative peer grading system makes absolutely no sense, and I don't think any real grading should be done by other Yale College students. Please make this clearer in future years. I would suggest eliminated the ""Above and Beyond"" section and grading the finals properly. Make the homeworks more difficult rather than circumventing proper grading through ridiculous tactics."
99369,Get rid of peer grading. Please. It's so unfair and ridiculous that 40% of your grade is dependent on how random other kids in your class grade your project (especially given that they have to grade it in direct competition to other projects).
99369,"It was nice having an asynchronous way to cover material, but there was low interaction with the teacher and the course grading is not very clear in some areas. But, it was a good way to learn about all of the content."
99369,"I think one of the strengths of this course is that it's not overly theoretical, which makes it very approachable for students who are not majoring in mathematics. Despite this, the course still provides a wealth of specialized knowledge, and the teacher provides a large number of examples during class, which makes the learning process enjoyable.  As for weaknesses, I can't really think of any. If I had to suggest an improvement, it would be that the professor should offer more courses because he is such a fantastic lecturer! I would love to take more classes taught by him!"
99369,"I really like that this course can be taken in any of the 3 ways in or out of the classroom. The online materials were carefully prepared. There were plenty of resources for Q&A. However, there were a few small issues regarding the final project and peer grading."
99369,"very detailed instructions, helpful ta&ula team"
99369,"Strengths are the unique topics which aren't necessarily covered anywhere else. Also the organization is top tier. Could be improved by more background about how all the techniques compare to one another, as it seemed like ordination factor analysis discriminant analysis, etc. all just did the same thing. Also some more theory."
99369,"Strengths: JDRS is a great teacher. His lectures and recorded videos are awesome and explain things really well.   Weaknesses: The grading of this course was absolutely horrendous. At the end of the day, the grade you get in this class is dependent on how nice your TA is. To account for the high grades in past years, it was decided that the baseline grade for doing everything in the assignment would be a 90/100, and to get more it would be considered ""above and beyond"", essentially extra credit for doing extra analyses, formatting well, etc. You could put in hours doing extra work and still only get 1-3 extra credit points (which is what happened in my situation and is honestly really frustrating) because that's simply what your TA thinks you deserve. It's frustrating that the grading ended up being so arbitrary, and there was often not enough helpful feedback to be able to improve between psets."
99369,Great
99369,"strengths: asynchronous and you can work at your own pace  weaknesses: everyone gets perfect grades so the curve is broken pretty arbitrarily. Even worse, that arbitrary choice is made by other students since the final project is peer graded. A component of that peer grading even asks other students to compare your project to other projects, which means you could end up with poor or terrific outcomes due to chance. Additionally, when you are peer graded the grader has no idea if you did the project alone or if you got to work in a group of 5. Not really fair for your work to be compared to that of 5 Yale students collaborating."
99369,"Strengths: Learned a lot. Pretty deep into the stats major and never heard of some of the tecniques mentioned in this class. It's a pretty low workload and can be interesting if you choose the right dataset to work with. Also, you can work in a group for every assignment... just make sure to choose the right partner(s) so you don't end up doing most of the work.   Weaknesses: To prefrace, the strengths outweight the weaknesses, still take this course, but I have a lot to say. The fatal flaw with JDRS courses is the way the final project is graded. Peer grading. Never got why it is done this way. Sure, it's a large class, but peer grading is a mess. Sure, it works since he takes the higher of the mean and median of your peer graded score, but the rubric is not speific enough. Some people might take .5 off point for a mitake, other's 3. It is unstandarized... also there were several questions about grading on EdStem that were never answered. Speaking of EdStem... you have better luck of winning the lottery than getting a timely response on EdStem. Sure, there are tons of office hours that have very useful TAs, but EdStem is supposed to also be a place for questions to be answered. This simply was not the case. It seems like TAs forgot EdStem existed, especially during the last few weeks of the course. It's an absoulte disgrace, checking EdStem right now, of the last 17 questions only about 2 of them got answers from course staff. Really? 2 for 17? Looking like Russell Westbrook's shooting spilts. Many of them were questions that needed answered to correctly grade others projects. Spefically, about how to assign extra credit points in certain cases, what to do if the group project you are grading has no group name, etc. Please do better for future courses, maybe consider hiring a peer tutor/TA who's sole job is to monitor EdStem."
99369,The course can be entirely virtual which makes it very convenient to take on your own time. There are a lot of office hours with very helpful TAs.
99369,super good
99369,"I thought that the material was incredibly interesting. I did not love that all the psets were group projects though - I ended up in a group of four thankfully, but I imagine that this would have been a very difficult class to do alone. I'm sure the standards are different depending on group size, but this would be really challenging for just one person!"
99369,"Strength: we covered a lot of stuff! So you are bound to learn about a technique that you personally find useful and will use later on. Weakness: Not a very engaging class in my opinion, but definitely interesting"
99369,"It's great that you can complete this course in whatever format works best for you but that also means it's not super engaging. Grading was all over the place. The fact that you got a 90 on PSETs if you did everything right was crazy but also, we kept losing points for not doing things we had done and repeatedly had to ask for regrades that sometimes went ignored."
99369,"Strengths: love how there's different ways to engage with the course in person and asynchronously. The professional recordings are great. Weaknesses: the grading is wild... the 10 above and beyond points are so subjective and make no sense, and getting a regrade feels impossible."
99369,"This course is asynchronous which provides freedom to the student. The student also has the ability to work in groups and choose their own data set for analysis, which was a strength."
99369,I don't think this course had any weaknesses. Strengths include the pacing of the course and the numerous office hours that were available.
99369,Well taught course and very useful content
99369,weak at actually teaching you the stat theory
99369,Strengths: clear modules and content Weaknesses: limited engagement or feedback on some assignments. I also wish final assignments were graded by JDRS/the professor or TAs and not as a peer grade.
99369,Think there was too much focus on outdated methods. Also wish there was more on what contexts to use the methods in.
99369,"The course is very well organized, and the modules are easy to follow with plenty of example code. However, I wish the grading is more straightforward since 10 out of 100 homework points can only be earned for going ""above and beyond"", which makes it frustrating if you want to get an A in the class."
99369,"weakness: the pset grading from our TA wasnt very fair a lot of the times. for instance, 6.5 points were taken on merely for graph titles. Feels like sometimes the TAs were just looking for nitty gritty things to take points off for.   the final project, which is 40% of your grade, is completely based on peer grading."
99369,I would appreciate more personalized relationships between students and the lecturer.
99369,"Strength: you could work with a group. The online pre-recorded lectures were VERY good.    Weaknesses: if you try to go in person or watch the recording of live- lectures , you will learn very little."
99369,Strengths: This course is very flexible. The professor and TA are very helpful!
99369,"I really appreciated the flexibility in the mode in which we can attend lectures (whether it's attending live or watching pre-recorded lectures). The slides were very clear and easy to follow along which helped tremendously in taking the quizzes. I also loved how we could work with our groups to do the HW assignments. One thing that I would suggest is that for the final project, sometime during the semester, it may help to assign a project proposal where we share information about the dataset we hope to use and what kind of statistical analysis we'll conduct. That way, students can be prepared far in advance to work on their projects."
99369,I love the flexibility of the course. the lectures were really engaging and interesting and the material is organized in a manner that is straightforward and easy to understand.
99369,"Strengths: JDRS is an amazing professor and super smart person. He'll answer anything you need accurately and correctly, and going to office hours is super useful, even if you go to one hosted by a peer tutor. The class also is set up to make the final project manageable, as long as you find a dataset early and make headway on analyses through the homework (the project becomes pretty much copy-paste). The lectures and asynchronous style make it easy to understand and grasp the content at your own pace. It is very well-taught and well-explained, and you truly do get what you put into the course.  Weaknesses: The grading is a little rigid and scuffed at times, with a single mistake bringing your pset grade down by several points at times. The fact that of the 100 point assignments, 10 points are subjective ""above and beyond"" points is a little annoying, and can make for extra stress and a lot more work. The work did start piling up near the end of the semester in terms of psets being due too close to one another, but JDRS did help adjust the pacing. By far the biggest weakness, though, is that the final projects are pretty much just peer-graded, and that there are places to compare other projects. Your grade depends on how other people do, which can make for some extra stress on the project."
99369,"The biggest weakness is the grading. 10 points (out of 100) are allotted to effort, and it is extremely rare to get all 10 points, meaning you could do everything correctly on your pset and still only get a 90. Also, when points are taken off, they do not clarify exactly what your mistake was or how to fix it. A"
99369,"Strengths: some interesting techniques, ability to work with our own data, lots of resources clearly explaining/demonstrating how to perform techniques. Weaknesses: lots of content packed quickly into lectures, some techniques felt not very useful/applicable for many datasets, easy to get through without gaining super strong understanding of techniques."
99369,"Overall I liked this course! This course offered a lot of flexibility in how it was offered, like the options between prerecorded and in-person lectures, and the way it covered mutliple methods like R, SAS, SPSS, etc.   I did personally find it somewhat frustrating that our assignments were evaluated based on extra effort, but I'm not sure this is a weakness - I have a tendency to do only what is asked, particularly for topics that I was already familiar and comfortable with, but the recommendation for extra effort meant that it kept me engaged with the content rather than phoning it in, so in an overall ""learning"" sense I think that was useful since it forced me to work a bit harder."
99369,"Strengths: asynchronous. Weaknesses: Literally everything else. This is such an important topic for people interested in data science, and it would be greatly improved by more focus on theory and understanding why we are doing what we are doing instead of copying prewritten code and using packages with built-in functions. I retained virtually nothing of value because the material was so haphazardly taught with little focus on the underpinnings of the methods we were learning. It felt like a waste of a credit. Also, the curve is incredibly brutal with very arbitrary and peer-based grading, so it's not even like it's an easy A class."
99369,Strength: learn a lot of techniques and get to apply to your own dataset  Weakness: you can take this class like almost entirely online and get behind on lectures very easily. Also the above and beyond points are a bad system
99369,"Strengths: Chill class, JDRS is a great lecturer  Weaknesses: Grading is excessively harsh"
99369,"Strengths: you can go at your own pace, pick your own dataset, and everything was structured very well! I was able to take a lot from the course in the end."
99369,"I think a highly motivated student will be okay, however its easy to fall behind on online lectures"
99369,The course is structured really well.
99369,"I love that the course encourages group projects. In previous stats courses, I have always worked solo. But this time I was part of a group that played a huge role in helping me learn. I also really liked how the professor offered many ways to keep in touch with course material and many options for office hours."
99369,I think everything is good
99369,Strengths: JDRS is a great professor! Really funny and engaging. I like that I have the option to watch lectures online. Weaknesses: some of the material is difficult to understand without seeing the previous lecture so if you don't keep up with lectures you'll fall behind quickly.
99369,Very flexible on your schedule. Psets are also only due every 10-14 days which makes it feel like a pretty low workload- as well as that you can do it in groups! I found there to be a lot of accessible office hours for when I didn't understand all of the class content or got stuck on the homework
99369,The course was holistic in scope and examples of code was very helpful
99369,"Asynchronous was a huge help, especially in terms of being able to work at your own pace"
99369,"Strengths: JDRS is a great lecturer and clearly is really passionate about the course. The options for watching the lectures - in person, livestream, or prerecorded - made it really accessible. Overall I came away with a significant grasp of the concepts. Weaknesses: The TFs and grading were a disaster. Every assignment felt like they were desperately trying to find something to take points off for, even to the extent that they frequently marked things wrong incorrectly. The 10 points for ""above and beyond"" on every assignment made getting a perfect score extremely difficult, which was demoralizing and didn't promote good work. The quizzes had lots of trick questions and didn't feel like they were actually testing your knowledge of the important aspects of a technique."
99369,Some of the methods seemed too specific to be widely applicable in multiple social science research settings but otherwise a good course
99369,"Strengths: Flexibility in carrying out the assignments and tasks. Lectures were extremely clear and JDRS is an exceptional instructor. Weaknesses: The R code for completing the PSETs is something of a patchwork and not all of the links currently work or work exceptionally well on all datasets. It was quite difficult to do the methods on our chosen datasets, meaning that sometimes we did carry out double work in figuring that all out. Also, the grading system, while transparent, did not feel very fair given that we were somewhat arbitrarily graded by our peers as opposed to the instructor on a shared metric of success. Another issue is that the feedback we received was usually very marginal, and being docked points for ""not going above and beyond"" again felt quite arbitrary."
99383,"Professor Smith is really engaging, and he has a way of explaining theories that stick. All the TAs were also really great for this class, and I could tell that the TAs and Professor had a good relationship. I can't think of ways this class can be improved except for making sure the class ends when it's suppose to end."
99383,"Professor Smith has used a very generous grading scale, but this allows him to provide very real and blunt feedback and tell you precisely what your faults are in your sociological writing. I would say this structure makes for more effective learning. The weekly sections with the TFs to touch on readings related to the lectures are helpful for understanding concepts in action. Because the course is an overview, you should keep in mind that it's very broad and may seem like a lot of content if you aren't able to really conceptualize the different sociological perspectives. Professor Smith is a really wonderful and enjoyable lecturer. His wit and egalitarian feel make the lecture feel more welcoming, and he brings in perspectives from the TAs if he knows they can provide."
99383,nothing bad about this course learned a lot. maybe wish classes were more interactive
99383,I think it is hard to retain the information sometimes because you have to be really listening and taking notes. Sometimes talks fast.
99383,"The two greatest strengths were the course content, which was almost always very interesting, and Prof Smith, who is incredibly engaging. The major weakness was the grading scale, which simply did not make much sense considering the amount fo work that went into preparing for exams."
99383,Strengths - great TA and section was super useful  Weakness - the lecture was sometimes too fast and info overload
99383,The lectures can be very repetitive and often run past the end of the class time. The sections are also not very helpful and seem a bit unorganized.
99383,"Very straightforward class, exams are fair and well structured, easy to follow assignments and lectures."
99383,"Strengths of this course were the instructors. It was evident that this was Professor Smith's course and the TFs were knowledgeable, approachable, and generally enthusiastic about helping us. The work load was also fine for an intro course. Weaknesses were sometimes the lectures weren't super exciting but that was just the professor's style. Also, the midterm test and midterm paper were due really close together which I think is a bit unfair. They were held/due on consecutive classes, which basically expected us to write our papers over spring break which I don't believe we should be expected to do. No one was going to start writing the essay before the midterm because we were studying, so the entire paper had to be written over spring break. Also, the rubric for the midterm paper was not specific enough about expectations and many points were docked for things that they did not specify how they wanted. Sections were great and helped the most for me understanding concepts through discussion."
99383,"Strengths: Very informative lectures. He packs a lot of information into each one, but I found that to be a strength because it showed a lot of different facets of each topic. Even though we only spent one lecture on most topics, the variety of authors he included in the lecture let me connect topics across lectures. Weekly discussion sections were a strength because we talked about some of the topics from class in a way that made them seem more applicable (2-3 research papers each week from various decades).  Weaknesses: I would have appreciated more detailed lecture notes. He has mentioned wanting to encourage people to come to class by providing very little information on the slides, but it would be nice to know that I can find the information somewhere if I miss writing it down or can't go to lecture one day. Having both a paper and a test for midterms and finals was also a bit stressful, but they weren't due the same day."
99383,"Strengths: I think professor Smith is a solid lecturer and was generally able to deliver material succinctly (even if he had a tendency to go over the lecture time by a few minutes each lecture). He also has a solid knowledge of the field, and tried to implement discussions into the lectures. Overall for an intro course I think I got a good feel of the broad strokes of the field, methods, theorists, and different lines of thinking in sociology. The TFs show up to class and contributed their own knowledge as well, which I appreciated. The readings were light and I generally found the papers/midterms not too bad, i.e. they were fair in terms of length and content."
99383,I learned a lot about how people and society work. I learned something new in every class.
