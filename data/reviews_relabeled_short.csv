97324,"Yes, I really enjoyed the topics we explored and it is not a class that will place a disproportionate burden on a student's workload.","r"
97324,"Not unless the structure is changed","dr"
97324,"I would not recommend this course to another student. I think this course was poorly organized and not taught well. The content of this course is very interesting, but was not delivered well. While the workload is extremely low, I feel that there are many other courses that should be taken instead of this one.","dr"
97324,"Yes","r"
97324,"Good","r"
97324,"NO - nothing is explained clearly, students are just expected to understand what the Professor is talking about when he barely uses his presentations or explains things step by step.","dr"
97324,"This would not be my first recommendation to a Yale student. The workload was low but student engagement was also low. Professor Jaynes is a strong storyteller and lecturer but it was easy to get lost during lecture.","dr"
97324,"Yes. A great econ elective, but also interesting content.","r"
97324,"I liked the subject matter but I did not like the teaching method","neu"
97324,"Yes, is a good econ elective with passionate professor.","r"
97324,"yes if you need an econ gut","r"
97324,"I feel as if there are other courses at yale with similar topics that may be better structured for learning","dr"
97324,"Yes! Especially if an econ major.","r"
97324,"Yes, it's a great course to better understand history from an economical standpoint.","r"
97324,"I would for an Economics elective credit. It isn't too much work, and you do learn a lot if you pay attention and look at the lecture notes. Professor Jaynes is charismatic and knowledgable about the subject.","r"
97324,"Yes - it's an interesting class with manageable workload.","r"
97324,"I highly recommend this class. Has a very low workload but covers interesting, relevant topics.","r"
97324,"yes","r"
97324,"Recommend to anyone in econ major","r"
97324,"Yes, I would recommend the course to other students. I think you will get the most out of it the more you put into it. The lectures are very interesting and Professor Jaynes has valuable insights and talks from personal experience as a black man who experienced racism and studied economics in the USA.","r"
97324,"yes definitely","r"
97324,"Gut course, but if you do not like group projects, I don't recommend it.","dr"
97324,"Yes. I think it was actually interesting for an econ class.","r"
97324,"Yes. I think this is a very important one that teaches about important topics in society.","r"
97324,"If you are someone studying economics, I would for sure take this course.","r"
97324,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone considering. It is one of the best classes ive ever taken, and the homework and projects were very enjoyable to work on. The content we learn in class is very relevant to the education inequality problem we face today, so one learns a lot of useful skills and knowledge.","r"
97324,"DONT LISTEN TO EVERYONE. Everyone says this class is a gut and while that may be true, if you get stuck in a bad group youll be the one having to worry about the homework assignments. This class is only a gut if you dont care about doing your share in the homework assignments.","dr"
97324,"If a student wanted to learn about education disparity on the basis of African Americans and latin x, then yes. However, the course summary was misleading in that I thought I was going to learn about education disparities across more minorities. For example, I would have loved to learn about education disparity for people with disabilities which almost no yale courses cover.","neu"
97324,"I think the content of the course is interesting, but i think it was structured a little weird and there was discrepancies with the work/lectures/lecture notes.","neu"
97324,"Yes. Very interesting","r"
97324,"I would because the lectures are interesting and the papers are open ended.","r"
97324,"I would for sure recommend this to another student. I think it was a great class to make me think about topics that I don't think about often. If you are interested in the statistics behind the inequality in education overall this is also very good in that regard.","r"
97324,"Yes, this course helped developed an economic basis of how education works which students would love to learn.","r"
97324,"I would recommend if there is a strong interest in the material but otherwise I think this class wasnt very engaging.","neu"
97324,"I think I would recommend this class to someone who is more interested in economics classes. I personally have not taken any econ classes so at times I was lost because I did not have the econ background so I wouldn't suggest taking it if you have not taken any econ classes before but if you have I would.","neu"
97338,"Yeah! Honestly just to watch the wire. I wouldnt watch the wire for fun per say but its such an engaging show to watch as a social scientist.","r"
97338,"I definitely would. The show is great and you learn a lot.","r"
97338,"The class is very easy to get a good grade, and the show is excellent. Going to lecture is a waste of time if not for the in class quizzes. Professor Harris never seemed prepared to lecture and there was almost no learning going on in lecture.","neu"
97338,"yes i would definitely recommend.","r"
97338,"Only if you really want to watch the show. Otherwise, it's a waste of time.","neu"
97338,"yes, it is an interesting topic and a new way to learn about prominent social issues","r"
97338,"N/a","neu"
97338,"Yes","r"
97338,"Absolutely! Great opportunity on an incredible show and a chance to learn more about American cities in the process","r"
97338,"I would recommend this course to another student because it provides an introductory though critical survey of the criminal legal system and its implications for communities that continue to experience economic marginalization and high levels of policing.","r"
97338,"Once again, really enjoyed the Wire.   This class is an utter gut. The professor knows that her exact words about the final assignment were ""not to be ambitious with it."" If you want that, then take this. If you are hoping to learn anything at all, probably avoid.","neu"
97338,"I think this was a great class to learn new things and watch this show in an interesting context, I will warn that I wasn't prepared for the energy that watching the entire show over the course of the semester took out of me- I thought watching the episodes every week would be easier than it was but 5-6 hours of the show a week just ended up being more time consuming than I thought","r"
97338,"yes!","r"
97338,"Yes. You just have to be able/willing to watch a lot of tv for homework.","r"
97338,"No, Im not sure I think it works well to use the wire, it creates confusion as to how much emphasis should be put on the show vs the political science concepts","dr"
97338,"I would but with caveats. I think there are two reasons to take the class. First, The Wire is an incredible show, and it's a great opportunity to watch it and analyze it in detail and second, I think the topics related to the realities of the American city are really interesting and important. That being said, watching the entirety of The Wire in one semester is a crazy time commitment, so you have to be ready for it. Watching TV as homework is obviously nice, but be prepared to watch an average of 5 hours a week and do try to take it with at least one friend you can watch the episodes with. Also, I think the atmosphere in the classroom at times felt dry. I'm not even sure if that's Professor Harris's fault, if it was the lecture space, or if it's the result of the collective attitudes of the students in the class, but it's something to keep in mind.","neu"
97338,"Yes, I strongly recommend this course to any political science student who is interested in learning about the politics of a major city, especially through the lens of The Wire.","r"
97338,"Yes! If youre able to find a good TF and commit to actually watching the show its great.","r"
97338,"Probably not. The course is a very interesting concept but engagement was very low.","dr"
97338,"I would not recommend this course for someone who has taken many political science classes or classes on segregation, the war on drugs, policing, or other issues. As someone who already had background and interest in these topics, I found the lectures quite dull-- they are really introductory, and not aimed at someone wanting a deep dive. Also, if you're interested in dissecting the show and understanding the ways in which its depictions are accurate or not so much, I would prepare to be disappointed. The class content is really just an introduction to social science-- it doesn't engage meaningfully with the show. Overall, I would only recommend this class if you are interested in watching a good show and not really getting much out of the rest of the class.","dr"
97338,"Unless you enjoy spending 6+ hours a week watching one TV show, on top of mandatory readings and podcast episodes, I would ABSOLUTELY NOT recommend you take this class. The sheer time commitment for this class is ridiculous.   Furthermore, I will say that I have learned very little. We cover very few actual political science topics. We spend TWO CLASSES covering how we might prove causality. I feel like I spent most of the class completely zoned out- there is very, very little substance in every actual lecture. We only covered the readings in lecture that were assigned, and her statements and slides had no citations, so you just have to take her at her word about the truth of her lessons.  The assignments are also often nonsensical or hardly related to the class. The final essay is TERRIBLE, as we did literally did not cover enough topics in class to even consider writing a good essay. We also had to cite her lectures in or essay- even though there was hardly anything to cite, as her powerpoints had very little on them and her lectures did not have much to add to them. There are POP QUIZZES/ASSIGNMENTS that are worth a SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF YOUR GRADE and they BARELY FEEL RELEVANT TO THE CLASS.   The exam was also extremely unfair towards some students. There were at least two versions of the exam, and the amount of time and effort that it took to answer the questions on one of the exams was FAR GREATER than the other, after chatting with other students about what questions they had.   I have taken TV show-related courses before in the past and absolutely loved them. This was not one of them. We should not have watched ALL FIVE SEASONS OF THE WIRE IN ONE SEMESTER. Two seasons or three seasons would have made this a much better, more focused class. We even could have watched summarized seasons on Youtube or had assigned summaries or SOMETHING for what seasons or episodes we would miss. Watching all five seasons made this class incredibly disjointed and made the workload much larger than it needed to be. Was the work hard? No. However, it was SO MUCH WORK.   Unless you absolutely love The Wire and feel like learning absolutely nothing and doing nonsense assignments sounds fun to you, do not take this class. Don't even take it as a GUT. Not worth it.","dr"
97338,"Yes! It has a light course load. The material is engaging and it's a good show.","r"
97338,"I was excited to take this course due to its description but was somewhat disappointed after taking it. While the class' concept is interesting, learning about the Baltimore drug scene and the politics of an American city by watching The Wire, I felt like lectures were not as engaging and interesting as they could have been. Nonetheless, it is a good elective course for the PoliSci major (as well as many others), but you may want to choose a smaller seminar if you wish to have more in-class engagement. However, the readings were interesting and it was clear that Professor Harris was very informed and passionate about the subjects discussed.","neu"
97338,"I would certainly recommend this course. The show is great, and thinking about it in terms of social science ideas is a fun way to get into it.","r"
97338,"I have recommended this course to another student already! How many times will I have to take courses where its required to watch a whole tv show? It can get exhausting, but it is still a fun element that contributes to this courses uniqueness.","r"
97338,"I would recommend this course because I learned a lot about how The Wire is not only a great show but can be used as a microscope in a scientific sense to study American cities.","r"
97338,"Id recommend the show, not the course","neu"
97338,"Yes but just make sure to keep up with the show and skim readings","r"
97338,"Yes!!! The show was very interesting, and the lectures were straight-forward.","r"
97338,"I think it's a great chance to learn more about the show and is good if you want an intro to social science that is fun. But if you're serious about the material, it can be frustrating.","neu"
97338,"Yes, easy social science class if you're naturally good at social science. I'm not sure that I would recommend this course to someone who's not good at social sciences unless they're really interested in the show.","r"
97338,"Yes if you want a class that has no work but a few larger assignments.","r"
97338,"Yes, interesting and good course","r"
97338,"Absolutely, it is fun and challenging and necessary to understand human society.","r"
97338,"Watch The Wire before taking the class and see if you like it. If you think it's interesting, go for it. If you don't, then you'll probably want to skip this course, it's not as easy as you might anticipate it to be.","neu"
97351,"Yes, absolutely!","r"
97351,"10000%","r"
97351,"Definitely. I learned a ton and feel better able to articulate both what exactly racism is and how it intersects with health.","r"
97351,"Very strongly, yes. Absolutely everybody at this university should take this class before they graduate.","r"
97351,"100% yes. Everyone should take this course no matter what discipline they are studying because it positions you to be self-aware and incorporate anti-racism in your lifestyle and thinking. The class is taught in a way that is super engaging, comfortable, and full of compassion. It will change the way you think about progress, creating change, and the medical system.","r"
97351,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student.","r"
97351,"Yes. 100%. Every Yale college student should take this course.","r"
97351,"Absolutely. This is a class that everyone should take regardless of your identity. For starters, Professor Roberts is an incredible lecturer and extremely caring individual. The information in this class is also important and something everyone should take into their futures, regardless of whether they are entering a healthcare-related field or not.","r"
97351,"yes, interesting content","r"
97351,"Yes","r"
97351,"A million times yes. Every student at Yale need to take this class. If you are pre-med/pre-health, this course is an absolute necessity.","r"
97351,"yes, professor roberts is the best","r"
97351,"Absolutely no questions asked take this course if you get the chance to!!","r"
97351,"YES!","r"
97351,"Yes, I would recommend any course that is taught by Professor Roberts. I also think that the issues taught in this course are extremely relevant and important for everyone to learn about.","r"
97351,"Yes definitely. should be a required class at yale, especially for pre-meds.","r"
97351,"Yes! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale","r"
97351,"Yes. This is such a important history to learn.","r"
97351,"100%","r"
97351,"10000% recommend it, this is a MUST-take course!! Dr.Roberts is just amazing and her lectures are extremely engaging","r"
97351,"YES - best class at Yale.","r"
97351,"Yes, absolutely. This is the best course I have taken at Yale and would recommend it to literally every single member of the student body.","r"
97351,"yes i really would as i think the content is good to know for everyone in their life","r"
97351,"YES, super important and helpful if you are at all considering a career in healthcare. every pre-med student should take this class.","r"
97351,"Yes, this was by far my favorite class I've taken so far at Yale. Professor Roberts is an incredible professor.","r"
97351,"ABSOLUTELY please take this class. But make sure you actually go to lecture, do the reading, and engage in section. the material is so important. please don't take this class if you are not going to truly listen and learn about the material being taught. The class fills up quickly so if you don't plan on being engaged please let someone else have your seat so they can learn from the amazing Prof Roberts","r"
97351,"Yes; the content is so relevant, and so important to all of us today and right now. If you only get to choose one more course to take at Yale, this should be it. Not all courses can so distinctly show you how to be a better person/make the world a better place.","r"
97351,"I would absolutely recommend this course. It should be mandatory for pre-medical students.","r"
97351,"I would recommend this class to every person that can take it. It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, if not the best. Professor Roberts is one of the most talented, engaging lecturers I have ever had. Every class was extremely meaningful and powerful.","r"
97351,"ABSOLUTELY! THIS IS THE ONE COURSE AT YALE YOU MUST TAKE BEFORE GRADUATING! Everything about this epitomizes what learning should be about---the lectures, the professors, the content, the TFs, the students it attracts---it all made for such a fantastic learning experience. Everyone, EVERYONE, should learn about this topic.","r"
97351,"I would 100% recommend this course to another student, no matter their major. Professor Roberts and her teaching staff are clearly passionate about the subject matter and are experts in their fields. The way they organized class maximized my learning and made me excited to come to class. Professor Roberts' passion for the material is palpable, and any student is lucky to be able to learn from her. This course material is extremely important, and every Yale undergrad ought to take this course to be a better human.","r"
97351,"Yes! Yes!! Yes!!! Do not leave Yale without having taken this class. You will regret it.","r"
97351,"Absolutely! This course is a must for anyone here!","r"
97351,"I would recommend this course not only to another student but to literally anyone who I walk past on the street. If Yale ever loses Professor Roberts to another institution, it will be a very dark day for this university and its students. She is a star, and the university should throw all of its support behind her. If you have no engagement with other HSHM, this one is the best introduction to how the history of science and medicine matters and how race is implicated in every inch of American medicine. I do not understand how a course could be more relevant to our lives as American residents.","r"
97351,"Yes, of course. This course is great for many reasons, but most of all, it is simply vital information to know to live and work in the United States, especially in any health/biomedical related field. Professor Roberts teaches in an incredibly thoughtful and captivating way and she is a joy to learn from and with.","r"
97351,"YES!!! a 1,000 times yes!!!! This was my absolute favorite class this year and during my entire time at Yale. I am so so grateful for this class and for professor Roberts. I think about the information we learned about African American history every day and it literally has made me see the world in an entirely different way. I was so sad when this class came to an end. I believe that every single student at Yale, especially those going into the medical field, should take this class. It was like I was listening to an inspirational Ted Talk every single lecture.","r"
97351,"Every student at Yale needs to take this courseespecially pre-meds. It will change your life.","r"
97351,"Definitely. This is probably my favorite class Ive taken at Yale so far! Professor Roberts is so amazing and kind.","r"
97351,"Yes!! Amazing class, accessible to non-History/AFAM/PLSC/HSHM majors, but also interesting and important for those majors. Everyone will tell you Prof. Roberts is amazing, and she is!!!","r"
97351,"YES!!! This is an essential part of Yale!!","r"
97351,"This is the easiest course review Ive ever written.  There is a reason why AFAM 170 is the most popular course at Yale and it starts and ends with medical historian and scientist, Dr. Carolyn Roberts. Ive been incredibly fortunate to have had more than my fair number of fantastic teachers - but Ive never experienced a more positive, enthusiastic, thoughtful, and deeply caring teacher than Dr. Roberts. To say she is encouraging, supportive and accessible would be an understatement of epic proportion. Dr. Roberts care, respect for and support of her students is an integral part of what makes this course so important and powerful she is the ultimate, most qualified guide to take students through a 400-year journey into a very messy, painful past (i.e. Sickness and Health in African American History). Her noble objective is that the course and the discussions and thinking that it provokes stimulate all of us to come together, as a learning community, to imagine a different kind of future. Dr. Roberts is a great lecturer and she goes out of her way to bring in expert guests who share their perspectives and voice with the entire class. Grading is beyond fair and straightforward and students are provided with tremendous flexibility and options when it comes to major grade components. Not only is Dr. Roberts truly awesome, but she has thoughtfully put together a team of TFs that are deeply invested in the courses mission as well as in the students in their discussionss success and well being. This past semester (Spring 23), I was super fortunate to have Charlie Tran as our section leader hes in his final year of his MPH @ the Yale School of Public Health after receiving his Yale BA in History of Science, Medicine and Public Health. Charlie was beyond awesome - facilitating and encouraging meaningful discussions, deeper dives on course material and always, providing helpful and actionable feedback on submitted assignments. He felt like the best kind of coach which feels in line with Dr. Roberts overall course ethos.   So again, this is easy: AFAM 170 is a critically important, topical and powerful course that every Yale student - no matter their major could and should benefit from taking. IMHO, its also a course that should be ***required*** for any and every student interested in pursuing a career in healthcare - either clinically or at an administrative or policy level.   I am beyond grateful that I was lucky enough to score a seat in this semester's course -- and have had the opportunity to learn so much from Dr. Roberts, her guest lecturers, her TFs and the course material. Im 100% confident that Ill carry and use the learnings and insights I've gained from AFAM 170 with me for the remainder of my life.","r"
97351,"Yes, it was by far the most interesting and the most different course that I have ever taken at Yale. I would recommend every Yale student to take this course, the content is fascinating and Professor Roberts is amazing.","r"
97351,"Everyone at Yale should take this course. If more professors actually taught material that is genuinely needed for the bettering of society today, we would be in a very different place right now. I say this with regards to Yale alumni who have become world leaders and the trend that shows a lack of empathy, understanding, and care. We need more Professor Roberts. Point Blank Period.","r"
97351,"Yes! Any pre-med should take this course especially.","r"
97351,"Absolutely! A must-take at Yale.","r"
97351,"I would absolutely reccommend. Professor Roberts is amazing! and the TFs are awesome","r"
97351,"I definitely would, especially coming from a STEM background, this course was very eye opening and interesting.","r"
97351,"Yes, everyone especially STEM students should take it.","r"
97351,"1000000% THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE IT SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT. I'm a stem major and still this has been my favorite class at Yale. Professor Roberts is the best lecturer I've ever had and the content of the class is genuinely so important. I can't say enough good things about this class. It lives up to the hype and more. It's also very low stress and Professor Roberts is so nice and accommodating. Take this class if you can get in, there is no way you'll regret it.","r"
97351,"Yes! Prof. Roberts and her team are great for authentic leading and they care for their students. Everyone should learn what Prof. Roberts is teaching.","r"
97351,"absolutely. this is my favorite class i've taken at yale -- not only is the format engaging and informative, but professor roberts is kind and loving. it is the perfect combination of gravity and celebration. i wish more classes were like this.","r"
97351,"Yes. You learn a lot of valuable information in a very low-stakes and caring environment.","r"
97351,"Yes. Best class at yale","r"
97351,"Yes, especially if you have future interests in technology, medicine, or public health. The time, energy, and commitment put into this course is quite evident.","r"
97351,"I definitely would, Professor Roberts is an amazing professor. The best at Yale to be honest!","r"
97351,"Absolutely. This course was unlike any other class I've ever taken at Yale. It inspired me to learn. Professor Roberts truly created a model of education that is founded on the basis of love, support, trust, and community.","r"
97351,"Yes!!! Absolutely my most favorite course at yale. Professor Roberts and the TFs see us as more than students, they see us as people first.","r"
97351,"Yes!","r"
97351,"Yes! The best course I took at Yale.","r"
97351,"Absolutely, best class you will ever take!","r"
97351,"YES! This course really opens your eyes to the dark side of healthcare and its historical roots.","r"
97351,"Yes! This is the best course Ive ever taken at Yale.","r"
97351,"This was by far the most deeply impactful course I've taken at Yale. It taught me to think critically about instances that I encounter each and every day. Clear examples of racism in medicine are discussed.","r"
97351,"Yes definitely. This course is a must take at Yale.","r"
97351,"Yes! I think this is a course that all Yale students should take.","r"
97351,"I wouldand already have100% recommend this course to anyone I know! This is a perfect class for anyone, regardless of your background in STEM or Black history. In fact, I would recommend this course especially for folks who are not well-versed in Black history and/or who are pre-med! Yes, this class is a guaranteed A if you do the work, but the material is absolutely worth learning. The lessons taught in this course are so important to know just as a citizen of this world, and while they ring especially true in medicine, they are useful regardless of what you want to do with your life. Professor Roberts is the sweetest professor I have come across at Yale, and she made a huge lecture feel personal. Please please please take this class; you will not regret it!","r"
97351,"Yes, yes, yes, without a single doubt. If there's one single course at Yale that you should be taking, it's this one. From the course content, which is incredibly important, to Dr. Roberts, who is kind and sweet and simply amazing, you need to take this course.","r"
97351,"Absolutely! It really helped change my perspective on medicine and science and how their histories are structure are embedded with racial science and how this impacts the present outcomes of medicine and science. And I really liked how this class also invited us to think about what are the implications and ways we can change this!","r"
97351,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches crucial lessons that everyone must be aware of.","r"
97351,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as it has provided a new course experience focused on helping the students learn, rather than obsess over grades.","r"
97351,"Absolutely! This is one of the greatest classes offered and taking it is a must for everyone.","r"
97351,"Absolutely, I strongly recommend this course to any student. This course is one that must absolutely be taken, it's too important not too. The course content and life lessons will impact all students, no matter their area of study.","r"
97351,"Absolutely! Changed me and educated me on a topic I was previously unfamiliar with.","r"
97351,"TAKE THIS COURSE!! I literally can not recommend it enough and believe everyone should take this class.","r"
97351,"I would 100% RECOMMEND THIS! IT WAS MY FAVORITE COURSE AT YALE.","r"
97351,"TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS","r"
97351,"I would, but with some caveats. I feel like the class was tailored to certain sensitivities and wasnt pushing the envelope strong enough.","neu"
97351,"Yes. Every human being should take this class. It changed the course of my life and my outlook on the world forever.","r"
97351,"Absolutely","r"
97351,"Yes, provides important life lesson and interesting history.","r"
97351,"yes, absolutely, especially if you have any interest at all in going to medicine or a medicine-adjacent profession. It is critical for all future medical professions to reckon with and digest the racism of the past (and reckon with how history influences implicit-- and sometimes explicit-- biases today) to learn how to use our platforms as vehicles for dismantling structural racism and avoid perpetuating the same inequities and racist disparities in quality of treatment that exist today. In addition, I think that the information presented in this class is essential for all Americans to have a truly comprehensive grasp on American history.","r"
97351,"Yes! I would 100% recommend this to someone else.","r"
97351,"Yes! There is a focus on student health which we don't see often in many Yale courses.","r"
97351,"YES TAKE THIS CLASS - such a caring community and professor, and content that everyone should know","r"
97351,"yes!! an essential course to take for everyone in understanding how our past still perpetuates violence today in medical systems and beyond.","r"
97351,"I would absolutely recommend this course to every Yale student. This course material is crucial for every member of the Yale community to understand.","r"
97351,"Yes -- the course is very accessible (low workload) but gives a really thorough and important look into medical racism in the United States. Professor Roberts is a great lecturer, and I learned a lot of incredibly important history I was unfamiliar with.","r"
97351,"Yess!! The best course I've taken at Yale!","r"
97351,"Yes, I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. This course touches on difficult, but very necessary subject material that any student, regardless of whether or not they're going into the medical field, should be aware of.","r"
97351,"Absolutely! Any chance you can be in the presence of Caroyln Roberts is a gift. I would absolutely recommend this course.","r"
97351,"Yes, every student regardless of your major should take this course. You will learn so much about some of the practices of this country and to be taught by Prof. Roberts is a blessing in itself.","r"
97351,"Probably not. I think the content is very important but you could have a similar experience by reading some of the sources on the syllabus without taking it. I feel a lot of time was spent on self-care instead of learning the course material. Im sure there are people that benefited from that, but for me it was unnecessary, felt a bit patronizing, and got in the way of learning the really important content.","dr"
97351,"Yes! Please take the course if you can. Professor Roberts is somebody whose class you do not want to miss. Not only is she a brilliant academic and lecturer, who puts her students first (which is very uncommon among most Yale professors), but she is also one of the kindest, most caring, and inspiring people I have ever encountered in my lifetime. The course material will be interesting to merely everybody who has even the littlest interest in the world around them.","r"
97351,"I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the history of medicine outside of what is readily available in the thousands of standardized textbooks out there. Dr. Roberts digs deep into the roots of racism within the medical field and draws connections between different practices that persist today and their unsavory origins. It's an essential course in my opinion. Dr. Roberts' approach to grading and coursework was also a breath of fresh air in an academic setting that can sometimes be too cut throat.","r"
97351,"Yes, course is designed not to get a grade but for you to learn.","r"
97351,"Yes!!!!","r"
97351,"Phenomenal class","r"
97351,"Yes! Great class and Professor Roberts is super interesting and engaging. The guest lecturers are awesome too.","r"
97351,"YES! Great class for pre-med students, but also a great class for anyone interested in learning more about racism and ""how we got here."" I like to say that the class treats medicine and health as a case study for racism in America, and there is so much you can learn about other systems of racism (government, economics, law, etc.) from this class.","r"
97351,"Yes, I think for all pre-med students this course should be required. Generally, all students should understand the roots of the healthcare systems and how groups have been oppressed within the system if we can ever achieve change in interpersonal interaction and our medical institutions.","r"
97351,"I would (and have) recommend this course to any and all students. I honestly think this course should be required to graduate from Yale. The topics covered are so important and this class is truly amazing.","r"
97351,"I 100% would recommend this course to another student as the topic, the intersection of medicine and race, is very important to learn about. Also, the way that the course reimagined college courses was amazing. Assignments were scattered throughout the semester and provided room for students to engage with the parts of the class that resonated with them most. It was never stressful, and I felt like I could truly learn, whereas in other college courses sometimes I am forced to prioritize cramming and memorizing rather than the process of learning.","r"
97351,"Yes. The class forces you to interact with difficult and sensitive material but gives you the flexibility in assignments to seek closure/ further knowledge on a way that best suits your needs.","r"
97351,"Very much! This class gives a good insight into slavery and racism against black people in the US. The class teaches you about the various injustices in the healthcare system and empowers you to be cautious of it","r"
97351,"Yes everyone needs to take it","r"
97351,"Yes, to literally anyone. This course was the best class I have taken at Yale.","r"
97351,"I would recommend because it is super interesting and you really dont have to spend time with material that you arent interested in. This course lets you focus on what you are passionate about.","r"
97351,"YES. Take this class!! Especially if you're pre-med, you NEED to be equipped with the info we were taught in this course. If you're not even interested in medicine, this is a GREAT class to take to learn about a lot of things that have been left out of most historical conversations.","r"
97351,"Yes, everyone should take this course, especially if you are pre-med. This course sheds light on how pseudoscience regarding race continues to affect Black Americans today, and also addresses common stereotypes we believe today.","r"
97351,"YES! This was probably one of the best, most important classes I've taken at Yale -- I wish it was required. If you have a chance, TAKE IT!","r"
97351,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to everyone. Even if it is not a field you normally study, the knowledge is incredibly important and eye-opening to the reality of our society and country. It has changed how I look at a variety of issues and the professor and TFs were incredible people to learn from and about.","r"
97351,"Yes, this is an incredible course.","r"
97351,"Yes! I think everyone should have to take this course to get a better understanding of history explained extremely well by Professor Roberts.","r"
97351,"I could not recommend this class more strongly. This class reaffirmed my desire to go into healthcare professionally, especially when Ive been struggling with the monotony and unnecessarily punitive and dehumanizing pre med curriculum. The course material was fascinating and sobering, and Dr. Roberts is a truly gifted educator.","r"
97351,"Yes, the lectures were amazing and really made me think about health issues in America in a different way","r"
97351,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course exposes acts of racism that are rarely discussed in medical school, and any student who is pre-med or interested in public health should absolutely take this course. For example, this course exposes the ways in which medical schools continue to perpetuate a belief that Black patients experience less pain. Students will also leave with a new perspective toward cadaver labs.","r"
97351,"This class might actually change your life - it is so important to take it. It is the best class I have taken in four years at Yale.","r"
97351,"Yes--incredibly unique experience you don't get often.","r"
97351,"Yes!!! A thousand times yes. Please take this course while you still have the opportunity to do so at Yale. There is no other course available like this one in its structure, support, and community. Professor Roberts and TAs are invested in YOUR success, in whatever terms that means to you and will do anything to support you to achieve that success. To make the most out of the course, I would recommend being proactive with the readings to get the most out of lecture. Lecture flies by so quickly due to Professor Robert's engaging way of presenting information and is a time for you to listen and just be present in that lecture.","r"
97351,"Yes! A great class, low-stress, very interesting.","r"
97351,"I would recommend this course because it is very important for people to be aware of the struggles Black people have faced and continue to face in this country.","r"
97351,"YES! Everyone should take this class. I left each lecture feeling like I needed to go out that very day and start working against the problems we had learned about. It is inspiring, heartbreaking, and deeply important. Prof. Roberts is a joy and you should take advantage of this class.","r"
97351,"Absolutely. This is one of the most influential and important classes I have taken at Yale thus far.","r"
97351,"YESSSS!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough. This is the best class I have aver taken at Yale. It was refreshing to see a professor care so much about us and our learning.","r"
97351,"YES! Take this course! Please the information is valuable for any future career.","r"
97351,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but I would give them a heads up that the topics discussed are quite heavy, heartbreaking, and often difficult ot deal with. However, if you're able to find ways to stay optimistic for the future, I would definitely recommend this class. I thought the readings were challenging (definitely not a ""gut class"" if you actually do them) and found the assignments to be unique and exciting. The weekly sections were also conducive to good discussion, and were a key part of this class experience.","r"
97351,"Absolutely, 1000%","r"
97351,"Absolutely! Such vital information to understand how America is structured socially and racially.","r"
97351,"I can't recommend this course enough! It is not a lot of work, but the lectures are amazing and thought provoking. The material is also extremely important for everyone to know, so that the world can become a safer and more welcoming place for everyone.","r"
97351,"Yes! Everyone should take this course no matter what field or interests","r"
97351,"I would definitely recommend this course to other students because the course content is so important and the professor allows you to engage with the material in a way that is conducive to your learning.","r"
97351,"I would. It was interesting and you got out of this class as much as you put in.","r"
97351,"Yes. This class should be mandatory","r"
97351,"Yes, important topics for everyone to learn about plus lots of opportunities to engage with the content in an individualized way","r"
97351,"Yes, definitely recommend!! The course was incredibly well-organized with very intentional assignments that facilitated learning and exploring. Every lecture was super engaging and definitely learned lots! I have also never had such a passionate and caring professor or teaching staff. This was by far the best Yale class I have taken!","r"
97351,"Yes, it was amazing to learn about all the material. I would especially recommend it to premed students, as it will be very relevant to your futures as physicians.","r"
97351,"absolutely! this course was life-changing and anyone who wishes to pursue a career in healthcare needs to take this course","r"
97351,"I would recommend this course to every student at Yale because it makes you reevaluate your knowledge on systematic racism and the healthcare system in America.","r"
97351,"Yes, I learned so much and the material was so intriguing.","r"
97351,"Just take it.","r"
97351,"PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Roberts creates an engaging environment and I think that the information in this course is so important for every person to know.","r"
97351,"Absolutely. Everyone should take this. Highly rewarding course.","r"
97351,"Yes! Favorite class at Yale so far","r"
97351,"I would recommend this class be taken 100 times if i could. I think because it starts with science, it legitimizes harmful stereotypes that are perceived as myths. There is so much love and beauty that comes from both outrage and hope. That is the classroom environment I felt in the 500 person lecture hall and in the small 18 person discussion section.","r"
97351,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is the most important class Ive taken at this school. It teaches the history that is hidden from many during primary and secondary school, and its important that everyone get a chance to learn this history.","r"
97351,"absolutely! One of the best courses offered at Yale.","r"
97351,"Yes! The professor is great and the course allows you to learn a lot without the burden of too much coursework.","r"
97351,"I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Roberts lectures are brilliant, taking you through each time period as if you were someone being treated in a hospital. You walk out of the lecture hall after every class thinking about the implications of medical racism, making you want to enact change in your life and others. The course really allows you to reflect on your life and your contribution to others as well.","r"
97351,"Yes! One of my favorite classes at Yale, and should be required for any student of medicine, history, American studies, public health, or ER&M.","r"
97351,"Yes. Every Yale student, especially pre-health professional students, should be required to take this class.","r"
97351,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student as it contributed to completely altering my view of the world. While I have become disillusioned in regard to the current health system, I believe that the material taught in this course has helped me better understand that the healthcare system must be rectified to become effective for the members most harmed by it. I would have never learned this material in school, and after attending lectures and reading the readings, I have realized that school systems must be changed to teach history effectively and relevant to children.","r"
97351,"Yes, 100%!!! This is one of my favorite if not my favorite course I have taken at Yale. The topics we cover, and the way in which it is taught, deemphasize grades and assessing how you are doing in a stressful environment, and instead invite us to an experience of learning in which we genuinely want to engage with the material and each take creative ways to do so. This is the type of grading mantra every professor should utilize where engagement with the material is emphasized.","r"
97351,"1000x yes!!!! Must take.","r"
97351,"Yes. Honestly believe it is necessary for people to take.","r"
97351,"This course is a MUST! Prof Roberts is amazing and you will learn SO much. Any prospective pre-meds should absolutely take this course.","r"
97351,"I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. I think this knowledge is critical for all Yale students to learn about.","r"
97351,"Yes absolutely, the content in this course is so important and necessary for every student.","r"
97351,"Absolutely--this is a class of a lifetime and Professor Roberts is hands down the most compassionate professor ever","r"
97351,"YES TAKE THIS COURSE","r"
97351,"YES! If you have the chance to take this course, you are lucky. By far one of the most impactful and important courses I will ever take. Opened my eyes to so much important history and tied it back to medical practice today. Professor Roberts is one of a kind. A top course at Yale.","r"
97351,"I would recommend this class to everyone!","r"
97351,"YES. EVERYONE should take across all majors. Hands down best most engaging class at Yale. Loved it.","r"
97351,"Yes, I also thought the final project was very thought provoking because you had your own opportunity to choose a topic and the format of the topic so you had a lot of flexibility.","r"
97351,"Yes, every student should learn about this history, and Professor Roberts explains it well in her course.","r"
97351,"Yes, but more as an easy class.","r"
97351,"Yes! I think everyone should take this course because you learn so much about history that wasn't taught to most of us.","r"
97351,"I would highly recommend this course to any student. There are so many different entry points to this course content wise, and so much for every person to gain from engaging with the historical roots of medical racism and the afterlives of slavery.","r"
97351,"Yes absolutely","r"
97351,"Yes! This was an amazing course, and I'm so glad I took it. I learned so much about the history of modern medicine that I never knew before. I loved that the class allowed for us to follow our specific interests too through assignments like the sample syllabus and lesson plan, as well as our final projects.","r"
97351,"YES! This is a really interesting course, and Professor Roberts is really, really kind and just makes the class so warm. I learned so much and think that this history is really important.","r"
97351,"Take this class!","r"
97351,"Yes, yes, YES! Especially if you are pre-med you NEED to take this class because it is so easy to get swept up by the (conscious and unconscious) flow of racism in the medical field.","r"
97351,"Yes! This course was a amazing.","r"
97351,"I think every student at yale should take this class, it is applicable to everyone.","r"
97351,"I recommend this course to anyone who wants to approach their careers and life through a critical and empathetic lens.","r"
97351,"This is the best class I have ever taken at the school. You learn so much and get the chance to really discuss the material and the ways that you want to interact the material going forward.","r"
97351,"100000%","r"
97351,"For a class like this, it's not about whether I think you should take the course (I do! wholeheartedly), it's about whether you will take this course for the right reasons. Professor Roberts is a gem; she is warm and kind and brilliant and passionate and there for all her students. Do not take advantage of that. Quite frankly, I was in a class with a lot of white people who seemed to be in the class for an ""easy A"". Those people are racist. I watched as they ignored Professor Robert's lectures in favor of whispering amongst themselves, they laughed when we discussed the disproportionately high rate of maternal mortality among Black people. I cannot stress this enough, please don't enroll in this class if you are not going to pay attention, not going to honor the voices of vulnerable and hurt people who have decided to share, not going to honor Professor Roberts and Kenya who put their all into every class.   But on to the positives, this class is truly life-changing. I almost cried at the end of every lecture. The class made me a better student and classmate, a better (future) teacher, and a better friend. If you can enroll in this course knowing you will show up for yourself, the teaching staff and your classmates, then you should definitely take this class!","r"
97351,"I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is or isn't interested in healthcare. Because this is not just a class about healthcare but also about a history that still directly or indirectly affects all of us today.","r"
97351,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student. In fact, I think every Yale student should try and take it before graduating. It is all upside and no downside and incredibly eye-opening.","r"
97351,"Yes, definitely! This history is so essential to learn and I feel like I am coming out of this course as someone who understands our current climate much more deeply.","r"
97351,"Absolutely, in fact I have. This is one of my favorite classes I have ever taken.","r"
97351,"YES!!! critical for anyone who plans to go into medicine (I think it should be required for bio majors/premeds).","r"
97351,"absolutely yes. i think the whole world should get to take this class.","r"
97351,"I would absolutely recommend this course! It completely transformed my understanding of science and medicine, their entanglements with histories of violence, and the unsung heroes who fought and continue to fight for a more just, healthy world. In a course which delves deeply into histories and legacies of medical violence, abuse, and neglect, as well as resistance and resilience among Black people in the Americas, Professor Roberts teaches with such compassion and respect regarding these histories and the communities impacted by them, as well as the students who engage with them. Perhaps what I appreciate most about this course is the culture of care that is fostered as we embark on this journey of learning and unlearning. I will never forget my experience in this class.","r"
97351,"ABSOLUTELY! Not only is it very important history but it also was excellently taught for students of all different backgrounds.","r"
97351,"I would 1000% recommend this course to any other student. It's incredibly important to learn about the history of this country that is often overlooked/ unspoken because it allows us to be informed about where this country is really coming from and why things are the way they are today. But I would say to only take this class if you are willing to learn and give the content the time and attention it deserves because what we learn is important and sensitive and deserves to be treated with respect!","r"
97351,"Yes! This course is heavy, but so important. You will learn so much and probably come out a more thoughtful person.","r"
97351,"Yes; this is a course that every student, regardless of their major, should take in order to expand their perspectives on the world and think in a more critical, honest, and inclusive way.","r"
97381,"Great class, Blight is a wonderful lecturer. He is hilarious, interesting, and passionate, and is a Yale icon for a reason. There's a reason this is a must take course before you graduate! He loves teaching and loves his students so much.","r"
97381,"Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the Civil War.","r"
97381,"Absolutely! Blight is a true treasure and this class is a must take.","r"
97381,"Yes, a must for anyone on the American history track","r"
97381,"Yes, Professor Blight is the best! And the TFs (Kate!) are as well. Regardless of the high school classes you took covering the Civil War, you are bound to come away with an infinitely stronger understanding of the events. You'll also learn the historiography of the war (how its story has changed over time) and gain a genuine sense of awe for some of the people and places involved.","r"
97381,"Yep- really good survey course","r"
97381,"If you're expecting to learn a ton about the Civil War, read McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom (which he assigns) and skip taking this class. Blight is a very engaging lecture, but his lectures feel like something you'd hear at your local library or a conference -- they don't add up to a full understanding of the Civil War. That being said, even if his lectures are usually on anecdotes, they're on terrific anecdotes. He tells stories of individual people -- two escaped slaves, Yale students who fought in the Civil War, Frederick Douglass and Walt Whitman -- that are always great to hear. That being said, the lectures are mostly independent from the material you need to know to write the papers and take the final.","neu"
97381,"If they REALLY like the civil war, maybe. But even then it stays pretty surface level, so a seminar would probably be better. Of course prof Blight is also a huge reason to consider the course, but if he had a seminar Id recommend that instead.","neu"
97381,"Absolutely. This is one of those courses that all Yalies should take!","r"
97381,"Yes. You must take a course with Prof. Blight. This is the kind of humanizing storytelling and contextualized history that makes a Yale education worth it. If you are concerned about the readings and tests, I'd recommend Credit/D-ing so that you can take the course at your own pace, but there is so much American heritage and explanation here that it's worth finding a way to attend the lectures regardless of the academic value of the course.","r"
97381,"I would highly recommend this course. Professor Blight was an amazing lecturer and storyteller who was also very knowledgeable on the subject. The readings were also very helpful and presented a lot of great, interesting perspectives on the historical period.","r"
97381,"Yes. It is a good overview of the time, and the texts are wonderful.","r"
97381,"Yes","r"
97381,"Yes, but I would caution them that theres a lot of reading, and the lectures can be hard to follow if you havent done all of it.","r"
97381,"Yes! Such a good history class about a really important period. Great professor, great readings, and my TA was great.","r"
97381,"I would definitely recommend this course to history majors or any non-majors considering taking a history class. The reading load for each week is heavy, but Professor Blight is a fascinating lecturer and I learned a significant amount about the Civil War era from taking the course. I always looked forward to going to each class. My Teaching Fellow was fantastic and gave us feedback that helped us improve our writing.","r"
97381,"Absolutely it is a wonderful course overall.","r"
97381,"Yes, I would. It was a quick but detailed look at the Civil War.","r"
97381,"Yes. Professor Blight is excellent. Be aware that the reading can be a lot (especially if you're taking this class ""on the side"") and much of it is necessary to given the style of the lectures. Blight's lectures focus more on providing interesting insight and perspective on the material than covering everything comprehensively.","r"
97381,"I would recommend this course to another student because it is important to learn the history of the civil war. I also loved Professor Blight's lectures.","r"
97381,"Yes, most definitely.","r"
97381,"i would. if you are at all interested in history/want to take a history lass, this is a typical yale class. the professor is the leading intellectual in the era (many of the books on the syllabus are his) and you will benefit tremendously from his lectures and descriptions of the decades of archival research he has done.","r"
97381,"I would, but only if you're really interested in the content. Otherwise, it's hard to stay motivated past midpoint. I took it bc my friend recommended, and overall enjoyed it, but definitely lost momentum","neu"
97381,"Yes, very informative and captivatingly taught","r"
97381,"Yes! Just a great lecture and a must-take for any history major, but interesting for anyone.","r"
97381,"Yes! Everyone should learn about the Civil War, regardless of major. If you don't know much, this is a great chance to get a big picture look, and it's more focused on the politics and ideological battles behind the war (rather than the actual battle strategies). If you are familiar with the war, as I was, you'll still walk away with a lot. The lectures are interesting, the readings are good, and the papers make you think!","r"
97381,"Yes! As long as you have an interest in the subject, the course is engaging and super interesting.","r"
97381,"Absolutely, if you feel that your understanding of the Civil War is at all lacking. I was lucky enough to recieve a great US History education, and so at times found myself retreading information, but even still I gained a much greater appreciation for the nuances of this historical moment.","r"
97381,"Yes! I learned so much about the Civil War, and learned a lot of skills that I can apply to future history classes.","r"
97381,"I would with the understanding that you only get out what you put in. You could get through this course without learning much if you do the bare minimum.","r"
97381,"It depends. If you have no knowledge of the civil war and youre interested in it, then yes. Frankly, you can get a lot of info from this course thru google because discussions were rarely illuminating. Blight is a fun Professor but his lectures are often hard to follow.","neu"
97381,"I would strongly recommend this course to another student, particularly to students interested in American history and/or twentieth century history. It provides a narrative of the Civil War and Reconstruction that stretches beyond a series of events to delve into individual perspectives and the lasting historiography behind the war. The course was taught in a vary engaging manner, connecting events and effects of the Civil War to modern events and the larger discipline of history. It was a very enjoyable and rewarding course to take.","r"
97381,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This was my favorite course of the year, and it provided me with not only a rich understanding of the Civil War and Reconstruction eras but also a deeply moving reflection on the evolution and nature of the American identity and the ways in which the darkest chapters of American history are remembered. This class was a welcome intellectual challenge, a rare course that seems to have had a genuine impact on the ways in which I view American society and that has expanded my knowledge of the Civil War era far beyond what I learned in high school history class. I am not a history major, and I would readily recommend this course to anyone with the space in their schedule to take it.","r"
97381,"Professor Blight is a super entertaining lecturer and incredibly knowledgable about his field, and I would recommend taking this class just for the fun of it.","r"
97381,"I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. I feel that the content is important to know and there is no one better to teach it than Professor Blight.","r"
97381,"Take this class. I was doubtful about taking a class on the Civil War, but his class is not really about military strategy--it's about the people involved in the war and the many ideologies, conflicts, and emotions at play in it.","r"
97381,"Yes! You'll walk away with a better understanding of an important period in American history, and you'll get to experience Blight's lectures.","r"
97414,"Yes!! Great class. Great history lecture","r"
97414,"Yes! Professor Magaziner is an amazing lecturer and I learnt so much about South African history.","r"
97414,"Yes and I already have! Probably the best history lecture I've taken at Yale. Watching Prof Magaziner give a lecture is like watching a tedtalk or listening to one of those historians on TV or something, he has such a good flow. Going to lecture was one of the highlights of my week, every week. And since the workload isn't bad, there's absolutely no reason not to take this course even if you aren't a history major.","r"
97414,"Yes, if you are interested in learning about South Africa and listening to well-spoken lectures. It's harder for people who learn based on facts/dates.","r"
97414,"Yes, if interested in South African history.","r"
97414,"Yes - I definitely learnt a huge amount","r"
97414,"Definitely! Apartheid is a period in history which is talked about a lot but difficult to understand without guidance, and without learning about the previous 200 years and how it came to be. Furthermore, the course has incredibly interesting links to the Cold War, slave trade and other interesting periods and events in global history. This class is a must take in the history department and for general knowledge","r"
97414,"Yes!! If you have any interest in South Africa, please do yourself a favor and take this course","r"
97414,"Yes","r"
97414,"I would most definitely recommend this class to another student! It's honestly an amazing class and one which I would suggest for even non history majors. It was a great break from the rest of my courses and Econ major.","r"
97414,"Yes!! South African history is so interesting, even if you've never been/have no connection. There's some quote out there that's like ""South Africa is where world history converges"" and I think that's so true! The projects of colonialism, imperialism, and slavery intersect in South Africa in way that bears for everywhere else in the world","r"
97414,"DEFINITELY. Even if you aren't particularly interested in South African history but want to take a history class, take this one. I threw it in on a whim as an extra history class and it ended up being my favorite of the semester. The content is absolutely fascinating and Professor Magaziner is one of the best lecturers I have ever had. Plus only two assignments all year, both very doable. Highly recommend!","r"
97414,"I would recommend this course because Professor Magaziner is great and the material is fascinating. We only had two papers, which I guess could be a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it.","r"
97414,"Absolutely! This was a super engaging course with phenomenal lectures and interesting readings","r"
97414,"Yes! Great lecturer, fascinating history.","r"
97414,"Yes. Please take this course and do the readings.","r"
97414,"I would recommend to all who want a deep-dive of South African history. Not a course for someone casually interested in the history of the region.","r"
97414,"Yes! The content is a fantastic, and Magaziner lectures like a spoken word poet. That combination made me want to attend lecture every day.","r"
97414,"Great for history majors but otherwise difficult to engage with","r"
97414,"Absolutely. I cannot encourage other students to take this course enough. Professor Magaziner was very accommodating when I enrolled in the course during the last few days of shopping period, and he helped fit me into a section. This class taught me a lot about South Africa, but it also reframed how I viewed race relations in America and the the struggle for independence in colonial Africa.","r"
97414,"I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a critical, multidimensional survey of South African history. The lectures are extremely rich and in-depth. I also appreciated the heterogeneity of primary and secondary scholarship, including music, academic journals, novels, and manifestos.","r"
97414,"Yes!","r"
97414,"Yes! This history is so important for people to learn because much of it is still very relevant today.","r"
97414,"I would very much recommend this course to a fellow student who is looking to improve themselves and their historical background of the world.","r"
97414,"1000% yes. South African history is fascinating, and Magaziner is the best lecturer Ive had at Yale. The course was easy to follow, yet there was a great amount of information and I feel like I learned so much.","r"
97414,"If you're a history major I would definitely recommend this course to you! The lecture is really engaging, and you will be immersed in the material. However, if you are not a history major and just looking to take this class because it interests you, I would consider thinking about the workload, which is pretty hefty per week. If you're okay with dedicating a five-six extra hours a week to readings and discussion responses then take it!","r"
97414,"yes, because this course alllows you to learn about how Black South Africans resisted apartheid through collective struggle and the spectrum of voices and different philosophies that determined how the struggle was fought.","r"
97414,"yeah!","r"
97414,"I would absolutely recommend this course. It is very interesting all around. At times, the material can be emotionally heavy.","r"
97414,"Yes! It's a fantastic history lecture on a place that I find to be one of the most fascinating in the world.","r"
97414,"Id definitely recommend this course if youre interested! Lectures were really engaging and the readings while long where interesting and a change from my typical reading load.","r"
97423,"I would recommend, great introduction to African politics.","r"
97423,"I would highly recommend and encourage students to take this course! It is a unique and amazing experience","r"
97423,"Absolutely. If you are all interested about the political landscape of Africa this course is a must-take. Easy to understand concepts and interesting case studies.","r"
97423,"Yes. I think anyone who is interested in African politics should take this class, as it will give students a systematic overview of the field and trigger interests.","r"
97423,"Not really as currently structured. The course has interesting and engaging moments, but overall it lacked a strong emphasis on a particular message or takeaway that would have left me with a lasting impression.","dr"
97423,"It really depends. This course wasn't all that I was looking for, as I was hoping for more in-depth case studies. That being said, the information learned in the course was still valuable, and I feel that I did take away some new approaches for understanding the history of these countries. Basically, the course sets the student up for further learning, rather than learning in the moment. I feel that this class would be more valuable if, let's say, it was taught as a two-semester thing. The truth is, ""African Politics"" is such a broad topic that it just cannot be reduced to a one semester lecture.","neu"
97423,"I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in the topics which it discusses; the content is covered clearly and comprehensively, without too much work added on top of it, and Professor Baldwin is a fun lecturer. A student who lacks interest, however, will likely find the slow pace and the taking of attendance too much to bear.","r"
97423,"If you have zero or minimal knowledge of African politics and want a survey introduction to the topic (and want to take a pretty chill course with an extremely nice professor), I would recommend this course. Also, this class has a significant but not too heavy of a workload. Good comparative government credit for political science majors. However, if you want in-depth study of African politics, I might look elsewhere.","r"
97423,"I would absolutely recommend this course to any political science major or anyone who finds themselves interested in governance because it provides new insight into how the political economy is developing in Africa.","r"
97423,"Yes! Fantastic introduction course to African governments and politics.","r"
97423,"Yes, it is truly a really nice class. It is gut-y (but you need to go to class and actually listen to do well on exams)","r"
97423,"Absolutely.","r"
97423,"I would strongly recommend this course to any person who has an interest in politics in Africa, how African countries have developed, and what current-day politics look like. I would preface it with the fact that ther is not enough time to go into all countries, and there is a focus on particular periods and countries in time but overall i tis a lovely course. Iwould also recommend it to people who haven't taken a political science class before and are looking for a relatively low stress interesting course.","r"
97423,"I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of political science. The course material is extremely engaging and digestible for non-majors and students in the political science major.","r"
97423,"Definitely take this class if you want to get a beginner's analytical view of politics in Africa. The workload is pretty light and mainly concentrated in the first half of the semester, meaning you get done with it earlier on","r"
97423,"If they're interested in politics in sub-saharan Africa then yes, but I don't think the material was particularly challenging and I don't think the feedback was reflective of the project descriptions.","neu"
97423,"Definitely take this class! It was super interesting as someone who had no background knowledge of African politics, and I feel like I learned a lot in a short amount of time. The class is also very well structured and I felt well supported as a student throughout the way. I liked how even though its a lecture, there are opportunities for students to be more engaged in class and in section to their comfort level. I really enjoyed this class and would definitely recommend it to others.","r"
97443,"I definitely would, it filled in the cultural gaps between historical events I'd studied in IB History of the Americas, and I loved the creativity and personal interest allowed in the options given on exams and essay prompts.","r"
97443,"I would if it was more structured because the subject matter was interesting but not well taught","neu"
97443,"NO. Do not take this course so long as Prof. Nyong'o is teaching it. It had such great promise to be a good course and it honestly really missed the mark. I found myself constantly frustrated because the class was not structured and was so confusing. The only saving grace was my TF who was quite frankly a better lecturer than Prof. Nyong'o. This class lacked structure and engagement and I really wish I hadn't taken this course because I feel like I got nothing out of it. This class needs to be majorly restructured if it has any hope of being a good class.","dr"
97443,"No. I think the topics are interesting and the syllabus has good reads but Prof. Nyong'o wasn't an engaging lecturer and I felt like the point of the course was confusing. Sometimes it focused on what formed American culture (be it neoliberalism, Jim Crow politics or the expansion of new technology) but other times it just felt like a basic overview of cultural/social movements or just a thin 20th century U.S. history course or an attempt to introduce us to the field of American studies.","dr"
97443,"If you are fine with doing a lot of learning yourself through a lot of reading and discussing instead of lecture, and are willing to be confused a lot of the time and are really passionate about cultural analysis then you should take it. Otherwise I would avoid taking this course, I spent most of my time just confused and puzzled, which made it hard to complete the papers or do the exams or know if I was doing anything in the course right.","neu"
97443,"Not unless the organization is improved.","dr"
97443,"Sure! I think I learned a lot, and the readings were interesting. I also liked that we had four different dates where we could turn in the essaysit meant that I could adapt my workload so that it was manageable and didn't conflict with other classes.","r"
97443,"I would recommend this course as the content is quite interesting and fun to learn about. The texts we read are also less traditional and they made for fun reads. The course was structured in such a way that it was not too much to handle, as the course load was not too much. Professor Nyong'o was very passionate about the content throughout the semester, which transferred to helping us learn the material.","r"
97443,"Honestly, no. I really wish I could. It was underwhelming, despite being a great topic. I will say that I loved being exposed to important thinkers/authors of the 20th century through the readings. But overall, it felt like there were some important holes in teaching style and also material covered (e.g. baby boom impact, more discussion on the export of American culture to the world need, as well as the role of suburbia, more about WW2 impacts on society/culture, more interrogation of social movements of the 60s and 70s)","dr"
97443,"The class had high ratings, so I must assume that it was a good class in years prior. But I would not recommend this years course to another student. The professor was disorganized, the material was disconnected, and I didnt feel that I learned much.","dr"
97443,"Under no circumstance would I recommend this class as is. There is simply no value in taking this as a class rather than doing one or two readings due to poor teaching and organization. Even then, any interest in American history, political or sociocultural, would be better served by one of many other classes at the college.","dr"
97443,"No. I don't think that the lectures were especially well done.","dr"
97443,"I would reccomend as an easy class, but I can't think of any other reason for someone to take this class.","r"
97443,"I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in going into American Studies, but only if the class was reorganized. I think the intent of the class - to teach about the discipline of American Studies - is sound but right now the class is not structured in an effective way to give a true glimpse into the major.","neu"
97443,"Yes, mainly for the parts outside of the lecture hall, like the readings and personal research.","r"
97443,"No, it was a disorganized, boring course","dr"
97443,"No I wouldnt. I didnt particularly enjoy this lectures, even though I did like my section.","dr"
97443,"There are other AMST / American history courses that you should take instead of this one the lectures are boring and super disorganized (skipping all over the place in time period and thematic sections) and the course isnt really well facilitated for learning and engagement","dr"
97443,"Compared to other history classes that I have taken here, I found that this course was disorganized and difficult to follow. The material itself was fascinating, but the structure of the course was not conducive to my learning.","dr"
97443,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It teaches you both about the development of American culture and the history of how we have thought about this development, allowing deeper thinking. The readings and papers are engaging without being overwhelming. The professor and teaching fellows are intelligent and helpful.","r"
97443,"I would recommend this course to another student interested in US History and culture.","r"
97443,"It depends on the person. If they are interested in the period and material, maybe. The readings and assignments were thought provoking and worthwhile. If they are looking for a course to fill a requirement or an intro to American studies, then probably not. For someone not specifically interested in the subject, I think the lectures would not be fun and it would be difficult to feel successful in the class.","neu"
97480,"This is a good course to fulfill the QR requirement or methods requirement for global affairs.","r"
97480,"Yes, I would recommend the course as it is a relaxing and not-too-stressful way to learn the structure, science, and math behind networks.","r"
97480,"I would recommend this course to a student looking for an easy QR or to fulfill a requirement for their major.","r"
97480,"Yes - good class if you want to refresh basic concepts in statistics","r"
97480,"Yes, very interesting to learn about networks","r"
97480,"Great class to take, especially if you need QR--the class is really structured around student learning and the concepts are interesting and widely applicable","r"
97480,"Yes, this is a great class.","r"
97480,"If you need a math gut, this is the one for you. Just make sure you pay attention on the homework assignments.","r"
97480,"Yes! Great for a QR credit. Not super difficult material, and all of the assignments are very easy to get full credit for (ex: homework is submit until correct for full credit). Workload is not bad, less than one pset per every few weeks.","r"
97480,"absolutely","r"
97480,"Yes","r"
97480,"Yes - easy gut","r"
97480,"Yes. i thought the content taught in this class was very interesting and professor Gopal conveyed the information very interestingly.","r"
97480,"It's an easy fifth of sixth credit. However, attendance is mandatory and part of the grade, so it's a class you need to show up and participate in.","neu"
97480,"Maybe.","neu"
97480,"Not unless you need a gut.","dr"
97480,"Yes its fun","r"
97480,"It was an easy way to fulfill the QR requirement, but very boring, especially for a topic that could have been really interesting.","dr"
97480,"I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for a new math class or a quantitative reasoning credit that doesn't have a very high work load. I found this class very manageable throughout the semester. However, I would warn them that sometimes Professor Gopal can provide very direct feedback during class--especially when we gave our final project presentations. Moreover, while network structures do provide a new way of looking at data, I believe the course could go more in depth than it does currently.","r"
97481,"Yes! - really interesting topics covered","r"
97481,"Math 222 is a great linear algebra class. From what I heard about 225, it seems like a large amount of work and a lot of proofs in addition to the content of 222. Unless you're a math major or enjoy proofs, I would strongly recommend 222 over 225, especially if you are any kind of engineering major. The psets for 222 were incredibly easy, so if you would like to challenge yourself then 225 might be a better option.","r"
97481,"This course is great for someone who wants to learn linear algebra without it becoming too abstract. It is interesting and will help you understand different real-world concepts.","r"
97481,"I would 100% recommend this course to another student because I really enjoyed the material learned, the tools we are now able to use, and its emphasis on understanding/application instead of mundane theoretical ideas that don't help in future engineering/physics courses.","r"
97481,"Yes to learn about matrices and build a foundation for other disciplines.","r"
97481,"yes for sure, Brett is an awesome professor","r"
97481,"Yes","r"
97481,"Yesif you need it. The content is manageable, especially if you've had some level of experience with it in the past. I would suggest watching MIT's video lectures ahead of time, or just learning the content online entirely if you don't need the class as a prerequisite for anything.","r"
97481,"Yes, I would recommend this course for students who are interested in linear algebra and who do not want the full intensity of 225.","r"
97481,"I thought it is very important to understand matrices because they show up all over the real world.","r"
97484,"This is a nice linear algebra class. I appreciate that it is focused on practical applications rather than crazy theoretical stuff, which is the whole point of the class. Anyone who is not a math major who needs to take linear algebra should take this one.","r"
97484,"I recommend this course if you have not taken linear algebra - the course offers useful theories and applications.","r"
97484,"Yes! The course is taught well, you learn a lot, and it's enjoyable. I found it helpful for my E&EB research.","r"
97484,"Yes. It is very useful for any stem major (even for computer science majors). The classes are very organized and the workload is extremely reasonable.","r"
97484,"Yes, I think linear algebra is a useful skill to have.","r"
97484,"I would definitely recommend this course Professor Barnes remade the class into a palatable explanation of matrices and linear algebra.","r"
97484,"Yes if you want to see how linear math can be applied in a multitude of fields, such as CS and engineering.","r"
97484,"Yes! A good class for getting linear algebra exposure, even if its not a requirement for your major.","r"
97484,"This class is a waste of time. You can learn everything the course covers in 2-3 weeks reading a textbook, the pace of the class is glacial. There is also not much time spent learning 1) why what you're learning is useful and 2) the intuition for linear algebra. We spent the first half of the class covering up to matrix multiplication. Take this class only if you have to, don't do what I did.","dr"
97484,"If you want to learn linear def take it and if possible with Professor Barnes. Has no proofs at all though so if that is something that interests you take the non application version","r"
97484,"its a major requirement","neu"
97484,"Not necessarily. I think Math 225 might be more engaging if you are willing to do proofs. It is a very chill class without too much work, though.","dr"
97488,"No, I would not recommend this class. Students do not learn computational tools for data science, work with data very little, and walk away with little understanding of any skills. The course is very unorganized and there is a lack of clear materials for students to follow and learn from. The homework is very time consuming because it does not align with what is done in class. In addition to homework, lengthy classwork was 'assigned' if it wasn't completed as a class due to mismanagement of time.","dr"
97488,"100%! Roy is an awesome instructor and the concepts you were help learn computer science and applying statistics to this.","r"
97488,"I don't know. I guess you do learn how to use some technical tools for data scientists, but the fact that there is quite a significant focus on theory as well and linear algebra, I don't know if this is the best class to gain technical expertise. I like Roy's philosophy of not giving exams because in reality you will always be able to look things up, but the homework assignments he does give have quite a lot of errors which makes it very confusing. If he polishes up the assignments it would go very far in making this course better.  Additionally, I think that the theoretical stuff that appears on the homework needs to be covered more in lecture. The tutorials on Python can be done on our own time, whereas reviewing linear algebra many of us haven't seen in a while is significantly harder.","neu"
97488,"No, I wouldn't. This does fulfill some requirements of some majors, but I believe there are better options out there. It's not very difficult or stressful, but attendance is mandatory and lectures are supremely boring. Roy is a great guy and professor and I wanted to be more engaged with the class, but the way it is structured made that very difficult.","dr"
97488,"Honestly, no. The problem sets don't really reflect what's learned in class (especially the first pset, you essentially had to self-learn the entirety of it with the readings and through other online resources). There's mistakes and typos in the psets that make the questions feel hastily done, and the vague wording of some of the problems make these psets a bit frustrating because I'd often have to go back to change my answers based on a GitHub Issues answer, when it should've just been clear from the start. Most of the lectures were just walkthroughs of Jupyter Notebooks, so it was hard to stay engaged sometimes.","dr"
97488,"This course was not exactly my favorite. Roy is clearly passionate about the material, and this was the best part of the class. The assignments, though, were unclear at times and the grading process was not very up front. Much of the material, though useful!, was pretty dry.","dr"
97488,"Only to complete certain requirements, like for the data science certificate","neu"
97488,"I would recommend this course with certain caveats. If you are pursuing a Data Science certificate or have a strong interest in the subject, this course could be beneficial. It offers valuable insights into different aspects of data analysis and covers a wide range of topics. However, it is important to note that the course has some weaknesses, such as the expectation of prior knowledge from the start and the grading system that focuses more on code errors rather than overall understanding. If you are prepared to overcome these challenges and are committed to acquiring knowledge in data analysis, then this course can be a valuable addition to your learning journey.","r"
97488,"neutral. I would recommend it to students who are great at linear algebra and love to dig into math","neu"
97489,"Yes","r"
97489,"Yes! I think it's increasingly important to have an understanding of basic statistics, and this class teaches very practical skills relating to data exploration and regressions","r"
97489,"Yes. If the student wants to learn real-world industry techniques then this is the course to take","r"
97489,"Yes, good S&DS elective for sure.","r"
97489,"Yes, this feels like a natural extension of S&DS 230, although I wish it could've been more organized (as at times it felt like it lacked direction, but it was also the first time the professor taught it), so we could have covered more content. Obviously, come in with strong R experience, since it is a high-level R course. I really enjoyed Brian's industry perspective, and the many practical skills he taught (prep for interviews, important libraries in R, insight into the sports analytics industry). I feel confident applying many of the models he taught. However, I feel like a final project would have been better than a final exam, since the class was more focused on R than theory, per se. I think the scatter plots on the exams were a great assessment/opportunity to learn when to use each model. The exams often had questions straight from the HW, to make sure we actually learned the content and didn't just copy from other ppl/TAs/etc. You should take alongside/after S&DS 242 though, as you won't appreciate the theory as in-depth otherwise. For exams, be sure to attend TA Shinpei or Brian's office hours. I feel like in class, we sometimes breezed through some content which made exam topics seem scary, but Brian and Shinpei did an excellent job of (re)-teaching the content in an understandable manner. Brian is also very accommodating to class/students' requests.","r"
97489,"Yes! If want to develop a general understanding and skillset for data analysis.","r"
97489,"Not really, it was boring, topics are covered better in other better classes, didn't feel like I learned much since no theory was used.","dr"
97489,"I think if it's taught the way it was in prior years, then yes I would recommend this class. Students who have taken this class in prior years have told me that this class was the most useful class they have taken, as it was well-taught and went over a lot of common data science topics. This year, this class had some of the most annoying psets I have ever had to do.","neu"
97489,"Yes! U learn a lot. PSETs are challenging at times, but I learned some much more R and I thought I was already pretty good at it.","r"
97489,"Yes, if you want to work in industry this is the course for you; Brian is a great teacher and the course is very applied.","r"
97489,"I would definitely recommend this class! The amount you learn in it sneaks up on you and you will be surprised by the end of the semester, because it is presented so well.","r"
97489,"Great if you have an interest in sports and data analysis","r"
97489,"I would definitely recommend this class to any student who wants to strengthen their skills in R and data analysis in general. I think the skills obtained from this class can be applied to a wide variety of disciplines.","r"
97489,"Definitely! I would probably take a couple of other statistics classes before or alongside it (230, 241, 242, etc.), but you'd probably do fine without it. I'd also make sure you pay attention in lecture and really understand all the coding that you're doing on problem sets, and you should be Ok!","r"
97489,"Yes, once the class gets more standardized, I see this being one of the better Stats courses in the certificate and major.","r"
97489,"Eh. Not too hard but didn't learn that much.","neu"
97489,"I would recommend it for a good practical class to follow up from S&DS 230. I think that everyone serious about data science should either take this one or S&DS 363. I think both are good classes. This one focuses more on effective data visualizations and generalized linear models, and I think is probably a little bit less work.","r"
97489,"Yes. If you like the coding aspect of stats like myself, then I definitely recommend that you take it. It helps you learn and realize how much more you can do with R. I have always used R for psets and completing pre-written markdowns. But working with different cases as well as shiny apps in this course showed me that I can do so much more with the stats knowledge that I have. I am looking forward to expanding on this and working on personal projects based on the shiny platform.","r"
97489,"For sure, definitely take this not only if you're a stat major but also if you're doing the cert. If MacDonald is teaching it again, even better. He's a great prof.","r"
97489,"I would recommend this course to another student because of the more practical aspects of the course.","r"
97489,"no, didn't learn much could learn everything more easily independently","dr"
97489,"Yes, I was looking for a class to take after 230 to keep practicing with R and I liked it a lot.","r"
97489,"Absolutely! One of the easier courses in the major, and Brian is absolutely one of the kindest and easygoing people in the faculty.","r"
97489,"I would if they were an S&DS major or if they were interested in doing data analytics. This course should only really be for students who have already had exposure to R and know how to program in it.","r"
97489,"Yes, amazing for analyzing data","r"
97489,"Yes. Data exploration is something I have used in my career very frequently.","r"
97489,"Yes, I do think this course is worthwhile for a student in a similar position to me. I think the methods of data analysis learned in this course are very useful especially for a student interested in working with real world data. I know I will be using the topics learned in this course as part of future studies and analysis.","r"
97489,"Sure, the material is interesting, but I only learned it all when I studied for the final, because Macdonald didn't teach us too much. Also, the first midterm had like a 98 average and then a bunch of people bombed the second one because he put some random stuff that he mentioned briefly in class on the test. So if you do take it, pay attention to everything he says in class.","r"
97489,"Yes for hands on experience in R","r"
97489,"I would, although with the preference there is little theory and a lot of coding","r"
97489,"Without restructuring, I would not recommend this class to another student. The DUS strongly recommended this class, but I assume this is because the of the course and the syllabus look promising (as I thought, too). However, students looking for thorough explanations of the concepts and methods they'll be exposed to in the class should look elsewhere. Of the Spring 300-level S&DS courses, I might recommend Multivariate Stats, isntead. The lack of project/application-based classes in this department is unfortunately scarce.","dr"
97489,"yes","r"
97489,"Yes, especially those looking to go into data science and statistical analysis areas. This class helps develop lots of essential skills.","r"
97489,"I would recommend it concurrently with S&DS 242 (theory of statistics), but maybe not if you've already taken another class that covers similar topics (such as S&DS 265/365 machine learning).","r"
97489,"Yes. Taking this course from someone who worked in the industry was awesome. The applications felt relevant and real, and In feel better prepared to utilize my data analysis and visualization skills out in the real world","r"
97489,"professor is nice","r"
97489,"If you are looking for a relatively easy and chill S&DS elective, definitely take 361. The psets aren't very difficult and don't take very long, the material is relatively easy to learn and understand. If you are looking for a more theory-heavy class, then you are not going to be learning much of it in 361: the class material is very much tied into learning data visualization and regression analysis in R.","r"
97494,"I probably wouldn't, especially if they were really seeking a firm base upon which to build more complex understandings of cultural Anthropology theories. If you don't care about anthropology as a field, and instead want a course where you can learn some ways to think about culture, sure take it. But if you are hoping to learn the principal ideas of the field, this is not the right course.","dr"
97494,"Yes, if you are interested in the origins of the subfield.","r"
97494,"Yes. I took this class just for fun and really enjoyed it. You should know that the reading load is somewhat heavy, though.","r"
97494,"I would recommend this as a course to any anthro major, as well as a ""fun"" social sciences credit to students looking for one. The course does not have any pre-reqs, the assignments were fun to do and engaging, and the methods we learned could be useful outside of the field of anthropology.","r"
97494,"Yes. Take this course if you'd like to do engaging assingments that make you think about different socio-cultural things about the Yale student body","r"
97494,"Take this class! It introduces you to the discipline but isn't too broad -- you still learn about specific cultures and learn about theories/critiques in depth. The class strikes a great balance of learning theory so you have an intellectual foundation, but not too much so it doesn't get boring. You read a lot of ethnographies and learn about all the different ways people can see the world! And you yourself will see things differently after this class.","r"
97494,"I would recommend this course if students are interested in human behavior and this side of anthropology.","r"
97494,"Absolutely! I think that learning to see the world through an anthropological lens can be incredibly helpful and useful in other disciplines as well. I feel like I am much more insightful about the spaces and environments that I occupy and visit.","r"
97494,"I would recommend this course to other students regardless of their major because it provides a very interesting lens through which we can analyze the social environments that we navigate in our everyday lives. The content of the course is very interesting but not too challenging, so it is a good course to learn applicable information in a low pressure environment.","r"
97494,"Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed this course. So much so, that I am considering taking another class in anthropology next semester.","r"
97494,"Yes, particularly to first years and sophomores. This is an excellent intro to anthropology and an engaging lecture for students of any major. For juniors and seniors in humanities majors some of the material is review and the course is not as challenging as one might want.","r"
97494,"I would recommend this course to any student interested in anthropology. It is a good introductory course that shows the history of the discipline and how it evolved over the course of the last century to address new questions. I find this course to be useful for thinking about and being aware of culture while also seeing its application across other disciplines.","r"
97494,"Definitely, specially to students who want to get out of their comfort zone, because anthropology challenges many of the conventional views that many students hold regarding their careers, the economic system, the culture of the united states, and more.","r"
97494,"I would strongly, strongly recommend! For some reason, lots of Yale students tend to avoid intro lectures as if they're not interesting enough or unlikely to be taught well. That may be the case for some, but it's certainly not for this one. Prof. Harms is amazing, and the course is simultaneously a comprehensive-feeling introduction to its field, while also prompting and allowing a lot of space for deeper/critical thought that you might not assume you'd get in an intro class.","r"
97501,"Yes!! Super interesting and fun!","r"
97501,"Yes. I enjoyed it and the topics.","r"
97501,"Yes! Take this class! You do not need to be an ANTH major to realize the value of the materials learned here. Plus, prof. Lombard was an amazing instructor who always managed to engage us in her lectures. Plus, each class starts with a fun video/song/article that is loosely related to the content of the day. Take this class.","r"
97501,"I would recommend this course, but I would let the other student know that the workload is somewhat hefty and the midterm and the final count for a lot which can become a problem when assessing say to day standing in this course.","r"
97501,"Yes! I would recommend this class. I love how Prof. Lombard weaved different disciplinary readings into our course and lecture was extremely interesting and engaging. Readings can be heavy/dense, but you honestly don't need to complete them all fully.","r"
97501,"Yes I would. You learn a lot and it is very interesting, as well as a manageable workload.","r"
97501,"yes!","r"
97501,"Yes, I would. Professor Lombard is a great lecturer and is dedicated to the success of her students. I would just make sure that you ask for very specific instructions from your TF regarding the final project, because the instructions are a bit vague. Besides that, I highly recommend.","r"
97501,"I would recommend this course to another student! I learned so many different things, and the assignments were fascinating.","r"
97502,"Yes, it's an interesting course to take, especially if anthropology is not your major!","r"
97502,"Yes if they have any interest in primates","r"
97502,"If you're looking for a class about primates because you're genuinely interested in them, then you'll probably enjoy this course a lot. But you need a lot of intrinsic motivation. It's very easy to just never go to the lectures (or even watch them) and do well in this class, since all the assignments are take-home. If you know that you're the kind of person who would do this, you might want to look for a class that would hold you more accountable.","neu"
97502,"I would recommend this course to anyone interested in primate behavior, but I think otherwise it could get a bit boring.","r"
97502,"Yes. I think this class approaches many topics concerning conservation and ecology in a very sensitive and understanding manner.","r"
97502,"I would recommend this course to people that are very interested in this subject.","r"
97502,"I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. It was really interesting if you are interested in animals, especially non-human primates. You get to learn a lot about human behavior too along the way!","r"
97502,"I personally would not recommend this course. The professor grades way too harshly and it's hard to do well in the course without prior knowledge of primates. A few slip-ups with terminology here and there in your essays will cost you dearly, and he's generally not forgiving of these mistakes.","dr"
97503,"Yes, I think it was very interesting and brought new insights to unfamiliar topics about primates.","r"
97503,"Yes it is extremely interesting.","r"
97503,"I would recommend this to a student interested in ecology and conservation. This is also a very accessible course if you aren't very familiar with the topic and just want to learn a little bit more about primates and conservation in general.","r"
97503,"I would recommend this course if you want a chill class with actually interesting content. The lectures are recorded on zoom and the section meetings are low-stakes. I didn't feel stressed doing the assignments. Anyone who has the chance should take the class.","r"
97503,"Yes, very interesting course to take for all majors.","r"
97503,"Yes! I learned so much about the complicity of conservation efforts and how the lines of morality can be hard to draw with an interconnected world. Professor watts was very understanding and easy-going. I always enjoyed going to lectures and discussion sections.","r"
97503,"N/a","neu"
97503,"Absolutely! Prof Watts is an absolute gem of a human being. He cares so much about primates, conservation, human rights, teaching, and his students. The workload is really manageable. And you get to see cute photos of primates!","r"
97503,"Would you like an easier social science credit that might accidentally pique your interest in something you've never even thought of (particularly of the primate variety)? Take the class. The professor has a bit of a shell, but he is wonderfully engaging and insightful once you're through.","r"
97503,"Yes if they care about primate conservation or want a gut class.","r"
97503,"I would as a good 5th class. Reading and papers are interesting. Professor Watts is kind and knowledgeable.","r"
97503,"YES YES YES. This class changed how I viewed conservation!","r"
97503,"Would definitely recommend this class! It's super interesting and the environment is very easygoing and conducive to learning.","r"
97503,"Definitely! I think classes like this where you have the opportunity to learn about something totally different from an expert in the field are exactly why I love Yale.","r"
97503,"Yes. It was a great class and intro to any social science.","r"
97503,"Yes. You will learn alot","r"
97503,"Yes, this course is interesting and a great way to get a social credit. The workload is low and the professor is very nice.","r"
97503,"Yes. It was a great course that brought to light a large scale problem and what efforts and being put into solving conservation issues.","r"
97503,"Yes. If you are looking for a more relaxed class that will expose you to issues of primate conservation and help bring light to the forces at play, this course is worth taking. Watts is a great professor and he shares some really interesting stories/perspectives on his time in the field.","r"
97503,"Yes! This class is amazing and will teach you more than just primate conservation.","r"
97503,"Yes, it was a great introduction to conservation biology.","r"
97503,"Definitely recommend, great opportunity to learn about conservation as a whole (trust me, Discovery Channel documentaries are nowhere near sufficient). You'll definitely get the most out of this course if you put your best into it. Professor Watts has great lectures and I suggest going to all of them; they are a great way to learn so many interesting things about primate conservation without having the stress of remembering every little detail in the lecture.","r"
97503,"I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in conservation, indigenous rights, or primates. This course does teach you about these topics and you leave the course having a more well-rounded understanding of the challenges that face conservation worldwide, and how these challenges intersect with indigineous and local communities.","r"
97551,"This is one of the best survey science courses for non-science students. Incredibly informative, relevant, useful, and filled with expert perspectives.","r"
97551,"Yes; Professor Prober's lectures are very interesting and he has great insights into the field of energy and public policy. He explains how innovations and policy initiatives show promise while also being critical of greenwashing and fake solutions. The guest lectures are also interesting and the lecturers are very impressive. I enjoyed learning about a range of topics but felt that the material could be organized better. The p-sets are pretty straightforward, and the project was a good way to take a deeper dive into a subject, but I think it would be helpful if we discussed the project deliverables before deadlines come up. If you're interested in energy, this class is great.","r"
97551,"If they need a science credit.","r"
97551,"I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in energy or is completing Energy Studies Certificate. It is a great introduction to a broad range of topics in energy and you get to meet many distinguished professionals in the field through Professor Prober's guest lectures!","r"
97551,"Yes! I am a hardcore humanities major, and I really really really love this class. The workload is gutty, but the courses are actually super interesting. The course covers a lot of topical issues about energy and environment issues around the world, the scientific knowledge behind it, and potential solutions to the issues. It is both scientific and policy wise practical. Professor Prober is passionate, humorous, and always brings tools for cute demonstrations. Overall, I really loved this course.","r"
97551,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially to a humanities person such as myself. The way in which environmental and energy related issues are examined from a scientific as well as political and economic perspective is highly engaging. For those looking for a science or QR credit, this course is actually very engaging to the politically-minded. You will receive appropriately detailed scientific knowledge that informs public policy in relation to energy and the environment.","r"
97551,"Yes, I would. If you are a humanities student who wants to understand the basics of energy and energy policy (and needs a science credit), this is the course for you.","r"
97551,"I would recommend this course to students who would like an introduction to energy units, conversion, and understanding of domestic energy supply lines.","r"
97552,"Yes! The professor was super engaging and the material was super interesting.","r"
97552,"Yes, I do recommend this course as your science credit for someone with or without a physics background. Everyone can learn something given the broad scope of this class and how knowledgeable the professor is.","r"
97552,"This is an incredible class. I think every student should learn the physics behind machines and their functions. It's remarkable how light the physics is in this course and how much Professor Miller can explain without crazy equations and computation. This class is exceptionally entertaining and educational.","r"
97552,"I would recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and challenging, but in a good way.","r"
97552,"It seems like most people in this class had a fine time with it, so I may be an outlier; regardless, these are my thoughts: I took AP Physics 1 and self-studied AP Physics C in high school and found this class incredibly challenging. I didn't miss a single lecture yet was in office hours every week to complete the Psets. I did quantitatively poor on both midterms (though there is a curve). This class definitely was not a gut for me and I hope I'm not alone when I say that. I don't think this is the easiest SC/QR credit you can take and would not recommend it unless conceptual/theoretical physics is interesting to you. As someone with more of a math background/math-y brain, I found this class and the concepts we covered really hard to grasp and truly understand.","dr"
97552,"Yes! I absolutely loved this class and think anyone who is interested in physics, chemistry, or technology should take it.","r"
97552,"Yes! As a non-STEM major, it's a class that is easily accessible but one that I feel like I learned a lot from.","r"
97552,"Yes, only if they are ready for a challenge and like physics. It is a very rewarding course but requires a lot of attention.","r"
97552,"Would recommend if you need a second science credit and are willing to put time in for both exams","r"
97552,"yes -- difficult exams, but pretty rewarding class","r"
97552,"Yes! I think it's a good science credit if you're looking for a class that won't be too stressful and still provides some level of practical knowledge","r"
97552,"No, only if you need a science credit. Felt like I was wasting my time.","dr"
97552,"Based on the information provided, I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in physics and is willing to put in the effort required to succeed. However, I would also advise the student to be aware of the workload and early class time (I'm sorry, I'm a night owl so you can't blame me, for not being awake by then), as well as the challenging grading on the problem sets and exams. If the student is prepared to attend every lecture, complete weekly problem sets, and study consistently for the midterms, then they could benefit from the practical applications of physics covered in this class. Ultimately, it depends on the individual student's interests, goals, and preferences, but overall, I believe this course could be a valuable learning experience for those willing to put in the effort.","r"
97552,"I would as you get to learn a lot new concepts in physics!","r"
97552,"Yes, pretty chill class to learn about physics.","r"
97552,"yes, you learn about some cool technologies","r"
97552,"I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in learning more about everyday technology and the physics behind it. As someone who has studied physics up to a decently high level throughout high school, I still left the course having learned new things. It is not gut, you will have to put in the work with PSETS and exams but it is totally manageable especially if you have previous experience with some form of Physics in high school. It's also a great way to get your science credit out of the way.","r"
97552,"Yes, definitely. If you are interested in technology at all, it is an awesome course. You will come away from it with a whole new appreciation for the physics that makes modern life possible.","r"
97552,"I would recommend this to someone who doesn't want to take a gut science but wants a science from non-STEM people.","r"
97552,"If you have taken physics in high school this will be a gut. Most of the concepts will be a review to you.","r"
97552,"Yes, good science credit for non-scientists. You will have to work, but not excessively. You will learn lots.","r"
97552,"It's an interesting gut class you'll learn a lot in. Not a cakewalk, but not a humungous struggle, and you'll take away a lot of really interesting information.","r"
97552,"I would recommend to anyone who wants to refresh their high school/ AP physics while diving into how the theories connect to real world technology.","r"
97552,"I would definitely recommend this course! It's not a gut by any measure, but it's the first time I've taken a physics course and really enjoyed it. We learned about how some really cool modern technology works, like phones, credit cards, fiber optics, and cryptography among others. The physics was not really too difficult, although you did have to follow along in lectures and do the summarizing technique that he recommends. Midterms took a couple hours of good study but the curve and questions were very fair. Super well taught -- Prof. Miller is funny, sardonic, and a true gem of Yale that cares about communicating science in a way that people understand. If you're a non-physics STEM major (CS, stats, etc) that's looking for a science credit that will help you learn more about the world and get you excited for science again, this is it. Just don't expect to glide through the class -- show up, and you'll do well.","r"
97552,"YES yes yes! As a non-STEM person, I loved how accessible and genuinely interesting the course content was. Such a well-structured and streamlined class made me grateful that Yale forced me to take a QR class (lol), as I would have never taken the class otherwise. I now have more respect for physics and for my fellow engineers!","r"
97552,"Yes, but be cautious and ready for the work. This is not a gut science credit.","r"
97552,"No, I would recommend a course that lays more foundational groundwork.","dr"
97552,"No, not at all. Biggest regret I made in my Yale career was to take my science credit my second semester senior year. Thankfully I have plans for the next year that weren't contingent on my success in this course, but if I could do it over again I would have taken a different course. In theory, this should have been perfect for me. But my apparent previous science preparation was not adequate, and the challenge of the course was off the charts. I will admit that some of my struggles were probably my own misguided attempts at trying to understand the content, and maybe I could've spent more time with the material to really digest it. But the fact of the matter is that this course is intended for people exactly like me: a humanities student who had done decently well in science and math courses in the past, and wants to actually learn something novel about the latter, rather than take a gut and waste my money. I literally took ASTR 160, Frontiers and Controversies in Astrophysics, and got an A in the class. Clearly I can understand physics to a certain degree. But not in this class. I asked actual physics majors for some help with the p-sets, and they were floored and shocked that we were talking about flux and E/M in the first few weeks of an introductory course, as the knowledge required to even wrap your head around the material is insufficient at our level. So please, unless you really know physics, are willing to not get good grades, or like struggling, don't take this course for your science credit. Choose something else, it's not worth it.","dr"
97552,"No, not engaging and not worth the QR or SC","dr"
97552,"Yes!","r"
97552,"it's not much of a gut. i found this course to be very difficult. i only got through it because i had someone i could consistently rely on for outside help. i would not have survived the course on my own. it's interesting but it was not for me. if physics is not intuitively your thing, the concepts in this class can be super hard to grasp.","neu"
97552,"Not really. This course is NOT a gut, and while you will learn some interesting things about some pieces of technology in our world, I don't think I learned enough to justify the stress that came with preparing for the ridiculously difficult exams and fairly uninteresting nature of the lectures.","dr"
97552,"Yes, but it is definitely a commitment","r"
97552,"Yes, definitely","r"
97552,"YES YES YES!!!! I learned so much and it was so accessible for a Humanities major","r"
97552,"Yes. Good intro physics class","r"
97552,"Yes. Its a great course for those maybe interested in Physics or who are just curious about the world.","r"
97552,"Yes, wholeheartedly. This class was at the perfect level for someone who wishes to learn broadly about different technologies.","r"
97552,"Yes! The material was challenging, but the course was well-structured and I walked away with a better understanding of the technologies we use everyday.","r"
97552,"I would definitely recommend this course to other students at Yale - especially those looking to fulfill distributional requirements. Don't get me wrong, the exams are sneaky hard and a lot more conceptual than the psets. You can grind through the psets with the help of Google and a TF, but you will struggle on exams if you do not understand the ""bigger picture"" concepts. Even so, you can do well in the class and find the material interesting even if you aren't a STEM person.","r"
97552,"Yes, it's a great QR credit for people who aren't confident in math.","r"
97552,"Yes. I wouldn't consider this class a ""gut"" because you need to attend lecture to have any idea what's going on. If you attend lecture, you'll probably need 1-2 hours a week to do the problem sets and will do well in the class.","r"
97552,"Yes, if they are interested in the topics presented in this course. It takes a lot of time and effort to understand the concepts, so it should not be taken if you are looking for an easy class.","r"
97552,"Surprised I learned something from my science credit! This is a good class but not an easy A as many would assume. That being said, you will do well if you just actually do the work!","r"
97552,"Yes. I would highly recommend this class to students who might be interested in physics. The class is very interesting as you learn about real world applications of physics rather than just an intro physics class where you would just solve a bunch of physics equations.","r"
97552,"Yes! I loved it. I had a slight background in physics (from high school) and I that definitely helped even though it had been like 3 years since then. If youre comfortable with math and science then this course should be a breeze and rather enjoyable. And if not, it should still be doable and enjoyable if you put in the time to attend all the lectures and go to office hours weekly!","r"
97552,"Yes if interested in the material. It was definitely cool to learn about the science behind things we use in everyday life, but this course requires significant time, effort, and engagement in order to succeed. So, if you are not invested in learning about the topics covered, it is probably not the best use of your time.","r"
97552,"No, its way too hard for what its worth and assumes background knowledge","dr"
97552,"Yes great course","r"
97552,"Yes, it is an intriguing course intermingled with fun physics.","r"
97552,"Yes, if you're looking for an easy science class and have some sort of physics background. If you hate math, physics, and numbers, this probably isn't the class for you. If you took AP Physics C (especially E&M) in high school, this will be pretty straightforward.","r"
97552,"This course served my purpose well, which was to get a science or QR credit without too much hassle. It's not the guttiest gut, but it's manageable and its' interesting because it's relevant to tech we use in daily life.","neu"
97553,"recommend over MATH 120, but only if you have prof puri","neu"
97553,"Yes, especially for non-math majors who need multivariable calculus to satisfy prerequisites. It is a much easier option than Math 120.","r"
97553,"Honestly, no. Professor Puri is a wonderful person, but the class is not well taught. Hard to follow along, confusing, etc. I don't blame her because she's brand new to teaching, but honestly could've been a lot better. Grading was very lax if you paid attention though.","dr"
97553,"I would recommend this class to students who have to take multivariable or are interested in the topic. I think that this course highlights the applications of multivariable calculus in a way that MATH 120 may not.","r"
97553,"I absolutely would. This a great alternative to MATH 120; the concepts were reasonable and understandable and the instruction was very well done as well","r"
97553,"I think I appreciated how this course was more application based rather than theory based which was helpful for me because math isn't one of my strong suits. That being said, I think taking Math 120 or some other equivalent might have helped me develop a stronger understanding of the material.","neu"
97553,"Yes. Take this course instead of Math 120","r"
97553,"I would for an engineering or math major, if not, then probably not.","neu"
97553,"Yes, I would.","r"
97553,"Yes, the Professor is good and the material is very important","r"
97553,"Yes it is very interesting","r"
97553,"Yes, this class was good at giving me the skills in multivariable calculus without unnecessary stress.","r"
97553,"Yes its a great way to learn multi in a more applicable way than mat 120","r"
97553,"if you need to take multivariable for your major, i would take this over math 120.","neu"
97553,"I would recommend it for someone that has to take it for their major, but dont come into it wanting to learn more math.","r"
97553,"yes if it is required and if it is with shruti puri","r"
97553,"It can definitely be an interesting course, but it all depends on the professor","neu"
97554,"Yes if you want to learn this content, this class is for you.","r"
97554,"This course focuses on straightforward content; however, Professor Sohrab's Psets do not translate to the type of questions he presents on the exams. PSets are very mechanical and long and sometimes contain applications-based/theoretical questions. Questions on exams can require an in-depth conceptual understanding of the content that is not presented in lecture or on PSets. I would only take if it is required for your major.","neu"
97554,"Yes if you take it on a credit D fail basis. I enjoyed taking this class and learned a lot from it. The exams and grading curve is very difficult and thus if possible I'd say it is a fun way to learn about differential equations and is taught phenomenally, but the grading is incredibly difficult with exams and having a small error at the start of a problem getting all subsequent parts wrong so take on a credit D fail basis to enjoy it more.","r"
97554,"No. Do not take with this professor","dr"
97554,"I would recommend other students to make sure the professor that is teaching this course is the right one for them. This class is fairly difficult, and becomes more difficult without the right professor. It's probably a major requirement, but don't make the same mistake I did and take it as soon as possible but rather wait for a better professor to come around.","neu"
97554,"No. Not with this professor. You will just end up learning from the book, which makes actually taking the course a waste of time.","dr"
97554,"Yes, if Sohrab is teaching it.","r"
97554,"I would simply take it if you have to for your major.","neu"
97554,"Challenging course, unless you have serious time to devote to doing lots of extra study outside of class and the psets do not expect to get a very good grade. The workload and difficulty definitely ramps up towards the end of the course","dr"
97554,"Absolutely not. The only people that should take this course are engineering majors that absolutely have to. It was not a good math class as it was too fast and didn't walk us through all of the logic. Most math classes don't teach both partial and ordinary differential equations in the same semester. It also was't a good engineering class because most of the problems, with only a few exceptions, weren't applicable to anything real and is something I will probably never use as an engineer. Some of the problems were relevant, and they were the coolest part of the class. All of the proofs and random unbased equations I could've gone without.","dr"
97554,"not unless you have to take it, this class is hard","dr"
97554,"Dont take it for din, but if you need it, its not bad its just difficult.","neu"
97554,"No, please do not take this course unless it is required by your major.","dr"
97554,"Probably not unless major requirement but I would recommend the professor","dr"
97554,"Yes if it is required for their major.","r"
97554,"Yes! If you are interested in science or engineering, this is absolutely relevant to your field of study! It was really interesting for me to see equations I had seen in other classes and had blindly the solutions for, and actually learn how to solve them.","r"
97554,"yes to anyone who needs it. I'm not sure why you would take DiffEQ otherwise but if you do, I definitely recommend taking it with Sohrab!","r"
97554,"No but unfortunately it is a pre rec for the engineering major.","dr"
97554,"Only if you need it. I think its incredibly useful though. Ive already seen applications of what Ive learned here in many of my other classes.","neu"
97554,"If you have to take it take it. If you dont have to take it and youve never seen differential equations before and have a huge course load, just make sure you take it with a different professor.","neu"
97554,"Absolutely not. If your here you probably have to take it. If so dont make the mistake I made. Try to find the best Professor you cant take it with definelty not with sohrab. You will learn nothing in class be stressed and just have a really negative experience with a very beautiful and important topic.","dr"
97554,"Only as a requirement - it's a lot of work.","neu"
97554,"If you do not need to take this course for your major then please do yourself one of the biggest favors of your college career and do not take this class. Unless you have an innate passion for solving differential equations, this class will suck the joy out of your semester while also doing significant damage to your GPA. There's nothing too exciting about the course that I would think somebody should use one of their ""spare"" credits on this. It's just a lot of long and tedious algebra on the problem sets combined with the most horrific exams you will ever take in your life.","dr"
97554,"Yes, if taught by Sohrab. It's an essential course for physics and engineering, and well-taught in my experience.","r"
97554,"Only take this course if you have to or if you know that you have a really strong interest in applied differential equations, it is a hard enough course that it shouldn't simply be shopped for a QR credit. If you have to take it though, it's hard but taught well and organized enough where it will be fine.","neu"
97554,"You likely are taking it as a requirement for your major if youre engineering. The best advice I can give is to always follow up on lectures with the textbook so that you can keep on top of the material. And make sure to start the PSets as early as possible because some can get very long.","neu"
97554,"I would not reccomend this course to another student. It demands an extemely high level of work in order to be adequately prepared for the exams which for some reason always tend to have questions that are much more difficult than the problem set questions. You are expected to know the material so thoroughly that you can adapt and basically learn new things during the exam period when presented with a question that you've never seen before. One could say that is ideally the goal of any course, however, the amount of material covered makes it nearly impossible to learn everything to this extent especially if you have other time committments which most of us do. Lectures are difficult to follow, your time is better spent going more slowly though the slides and reading the textbook. Extra help is hard to come by, there is only one study hall a week with one TF present, the peer tutors often cancel their hours, and other office hours are inconveniently timed. Unfortunately, this class is required for many like myself and they don't have the option not to take it.","dr"
97554,"Its required for most people who take it, but also yes. It has the capacity to be interesting and is very important for further math courses. I just didn't have the best time myself.","r"
97554,"No, but this is still one of the better taught versions of the course out there. Sohrab is very smart and knows his way around the material, but his psets and exams are a genuine intellectual challenge and getting an A is not possible unless youve studied differential equations before. Be warned!","dr"
97554,"Yes if you want a solid understanding of diff eqs broadly, and their applications. Appreciated the connections made to mechanical and electrical systems. Does not really go into theory/very fast-paced so if interested in pure math, take the math one. If you do not need diff-eqs for your major/already a full semester, maybe rethink taking it, because it is high difficulty, high workload","r"
97554,"Do not take this course unless you have to, and based on what I've heard, you should try to take it with Prof. Bennett if you can. I really wish I listened to that advice when I got it.","dr"
97554,"Yes I think this course is a really good course for learning an introduction to differential equations.","r"
97571,"If you want a basic art history course and an excuse to handle objects from the YUAG, yes. But if you're someone who will easily start blowing off lectures once they get a little boring, you might not get much out of it past the midterm","neu"
97571,"Yes, if theyre looking for a general survey of decorative arts.","r"
97571,"Yes, especially if you are into arts and crafts.","r"
97571,"I would highly recommend this course to other students. The best way to describe this course would be fun. Few will every have the opportunity to touch objects from a museum while having enough information to properly analyze them.","r"
97571,"Yes, definitely! This course changed how I see the world. I never realized how surrounded we are by objects, and this course made me see these objects in a whole new light. Now, when I see a chair in my dorm or a dining hall mug, I can't help but think of the materials and process that went into making those things. This is such a cool class, and it's a truly one-of-a-kind opportunity to be able to take it. I'm a senior, and this was one of my favorite classes in my entire Yale experience. So yes, definitely take this class!!","r"
97571,"Yes!","r"
97571,"Yes, if you are interested in decorative objects or art history specifically about ceramics, textiles, metal work or wood work. Otherwise, the material may seem boring or dense.","neu"
97571,"If you're looking for an intro art history credit (or are hoping to get a taste for the major), look elsewhere! It's fine, but I regret using one of my precious few slots for classes on this course. More engaging and applicable courses elsewhere.","dr"
97571,"I think it was very interesting and I learned information I never would have learned otherwise.","r"
97571,"I would recommend this course to someone looking for a solid Art History intro course. That said, the content is pretty different from other HSAR courses at Yale, and I would make sure you are at least semi-interested in learning about the kinds of objects discussed in the course (textiles, furniture, ceramics, etc).","r"
97571,"Definitely! The lectures felt a bit dry for my taste, especially towards the end of the semester, but the heart of this course is really the sections. Section gives you the opportunity to physically handle the objects that you're studying in lecture, which not many other art history courses let you do. This hands-on component is truly unparalleled, and also gives you the opportunity to explore the YUAG which is in and of itself a hallmark of Yale that everyone should explore.","r"
97571,"Yes absolutely! I had never taken an art history class before and this course was an incredible introduction to their distinct style and workload.","r"
97571,"Yes! This course was incredibly interesting and Professor Cooke was very engaging. All of the lectures were easy to follow and Professor Cooke explained things in a clear way. Section really built on the material from lecture and helped to cement the concepts and materials from lecture.","r"
97571,"Yes, there are many unique opportunities explored in this course involving the Yale Art Gallery","r"
97571,"YES, such a fun and amazing class. Lecture can be a bit dry a times however. Make sure you take this with Soffia if you can!","r"
97571,"Yes! Very unique class that is chill and engaging.","r"
97571,"Yes, Professor Cooke and his teaching team are top-notch. This was a really, really fun class that I loved and looked forward to. It was a refreshing change of pace from pure visual analysis.","r"
97571,"Yes I defiantly would recommend this class, well taught and very interesting!","r"
97571,"I would definitely recommend this course to other students especially for the lecturing by Professor Cooke","r"
97571,"Yes!!! Primarily for the chance to experience section in the YUAG object study room!","r"
97571,"Yes!! This has been one of my favorite courses :) if you are at all interested in art or museum-going you HAVE to take this course. The best part is being able to hold and examine the objects that you usually see behind glass or on display at the YUAG in order to learn about them.","r"
97571,"Absolutely! This is a great course with very little work outside of class. Despite this, it is incredibly rewarding and just paying attention in class will teach you a lot about art and material culture.","r"
97571,"Its not my favorite intro HSAR class but its often the only one consistently offered professor Cooke is very very invested in the subject matter so take it if a passionate professor matters, but be prepared to go in depth with tons of objects","neu"
97571,"I'd highly recommend this course. It was really high bang for your buck; the assignments were few and super manageable, and the content was so enriching. It just made me look at the world around me differently and see objects for all parts of their history -- as things that are manufactured in certain social and cultural contexts and which take on various meanings throughout their lifetimes. Going to discussion section in the YUAG and actually handling really objects was an incredible experience and made the lecture content all the more meaningful. And I really enjoyed the label-writing assignments because it was a fun way to try to condense the themes I was learning into a very concise format. Also, Professor Cooke is just wonderful. He's so kind and willing to engage with students and answer questions both after class and in his office hours. He's a professor well worth taking a class with and just good to know in general.","r"
97571,"If you are even slightly interested in decorative art, history, or cultural interchange, I would highly recommend this course. It takes content that could easily be dry and organizes it in a way that clarifies its richer meaning at every step. The lectures, sections, and assignments are all hands-on and experience-based rather than being entirely rooted in theory.","r"
97571,"I would recommend this course to other students because I feel as though I view formal and everyday objects through a different, informed perspective now.","r"
97595,"I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for an overview of many general topics in the area and for a low workload class. I wouldn't recommend it if students dislike group work, as 60% of the grade is group work.","neu"
97595,"If you need an extremely easy credit/d then yes.","r"
97595,"No - overall just very boring. Did not find lectures engaging.","dr"
97595,"I would not recommend this course! Incredibly boring to sit in lecture, teaching is very confusing, nothing is explained simply and they use unnecessarily difficult vocabulary in lecture and section and expect you to know it. I took this as a gut and i sincerely regret it","dr"
97595,"Yes, if a student is interested in a more relaxed, but still intellectually engaging class, this is a great fit!","r"
97595,"Yes, if you are interested in how the world works based on structural systems!","r"
97595,"It is a good class to fill a distributional requirement, there was not much work at all. I would definitely recommend if someone is looking for a low commitment class.","r"
97595,"Not really","dr"
97595,"I would highly recommend that another student take Globalization Space during a future semester, even for students not studying architecture or global studies. It offers a global perspective on international policy, the flows of capital, and infrastructure development.","r"
97595,"Yes. This class is very abstract and difficult to completely follow, but its also engaging and challenges you to conceive of space organization differently.","r"
97595,"Yes, I think that the course does a good job of exposing one to a variety of different topics from geopolitics and case studies to more abstract theory. While sometimes the lectures can be confusing in how both broad and specific they are, I found the final group project to be a rewarding way of tying together the many ideas put forward in the class.","r"
97595,"Probably not. The class can be worthwhile if you are heavily engaged, but personally I found much of the material confusing and also uninteresting.","dr"
97595,"I would recommend this course to a student who has extra time on their hands/is looking for a 5th class and who is interested in global affairs. Otherwise, no.","neu"
97595,"Absolutely! Keller is very kind and her lectures are definitely meant to be absorbed. It's easy to be skeptical and dismissive of her lecturing, but it's worth trying to appreciate what she is saying and why. I found the lectures and to a lesser extent the reading to be an interesting way of presenting the problems facing the world.","r"
97595,"I feel like it varies what people get out of it. Personally, I found it relatively interesting. A group project is a large component of the work required for the course which some people enjoy.","neu"
97595,"Yes, but I would let them know you only get as much out of it as you give. If you truly do the reading and engage in meaningful conversation with your team and TF you will gain so much and the class will genuinely change your perspective about the forms and systems that surround us no matter where you are. I loved talking with my TF and built a genuine relationship with them, them alone made this class worth it.","r"
97595,"I would recommend this course to another student who enjoys architecture. This is not a gut.","r"
97595,"good class for gut and humanities credit","r"
97595,"Yes 100%","r"
97595,"I would not reccomend this course to another student. It was frustratingly ambigious. The lecture topics were unclear, the assignments were unclear, and what the course was trying to teach as a whole was unclear.","dr"
97595,"No. I find it hard to write this because I don't dislike Keller. She is very smart and understands so much about her field. But to be as honest as I can be, you will learn next to nothing in this course. You will not be engaged. You will not want to go to lecture or pay attention when you are there because when Keller opens her mouth she might as well just be saying ""gabagool"" over and over again. You would probably learn more from ""gabagool"" to be honest. This course needs some serious reframing and restructuring to accomplish anything as a vessel for education because right now, it isn't.","dr"
97595,"Not unless you have to take it. The readings are fantastic and the core idea is great, but the lectures are not well designed and are very hard to follow -- there are other classes that will do a better job teaching you to think critically about how power is embedded in infrastructure/geography. Sometimes the assignments (and lectures) felt like an exercise in academic-speak without anything meaningful behind them. Discussion section is fantastic and thought-provoking if you have a good TF, and the group project can be fun.","dr"
97662,"Yes, very exciting, and very well summarised lecture slides.","r"
97662,"It's a fun science credit, but I don't think I totally understood everything by the end which kind of bothered me personally. But for some people this isn't an issue and it's still very interesting to learn about our universe, beyond Earth.","neu"
97662,"Yes this was a great course to gain knowledge in the basics of Astronomy and to see if I wanted to continue Astro.","r"
97662,"I would only recommend this course if you genuinely have an interest in astronomy because the material could get quite dense for potential non-stem majors. If you need to fulfill a science distributional requirement, then this course is manageable if you are prepared to put in the work. Moreover, I would caution against waiting until the last minute to complete the weekly p-sets as they were long and quite difficult. However, going to TF office hours will significantly help you on your homework.","neu"
97662,"Yes if theyre looking for an interesting and challenging QR credit as a humanities person","r"
97662,"Yes! This is a great science credit for non-science majors. This class taught me a LOT but never at the expense of anxiety about grades. This class definitely feels like a QR, so if you're not a fan of calculations-based homework assignments and exams this might not be the science credit for you.","r"
97662,"Yes good science credit and overall easy class","r"
97662,"No. The psets & exams have nothing to do with what is taught in lecture. Professor Kenneys slides and teaching style was confusing, repetitive, and it was never clear what information we actually needed to know. Outside of psets, not really any opportunities to practice the QR skills that take up 50% of the final exam.","dr"
97662,"I would say it was a fine class to take, but I would say be aware that you will have to put in more work than just being active in the lectures since what you are expected to do is not necessarily taught to you through lecture.","neu"
97662,"Yes I thought the material was really interesting but it is very math based if you like that kind of thing","r"
97662,"No its not well-taught","dr"
97662,"Yeah its a quasi gut","r"
97662,"Yes, if youre interested in both the theoretical and math/physics aspects of astronomy.","r"
97663,"Yes, it's interesting and the topics covered are fun.","r"
97663,"Anyone with a passing interest in astronomy should definitely take this course.","r"
97663,"Fun science credit, 10 PSets so almost every week even when it didn't feel exactly necessary.","r"
97663,"Absolutely. This class is incredibly interesting and genuinely changed my perspective on our role in the universe. Wouldn't call it a gut but it's not difficult to succeed in the course with help from TFs and a bit of studying. Great way to fulfill your science credit, also doesn't involve very much math. Take it with Faison if you get the chance.","r"
97663,"Not really -- it's not a gut science class like it's advertised as. The professor goes on random rambles all the time, and you never learn anything much in lectures, you'd be better off watching youtube videos or reading textbooks online. The professor is very bad at keeping up with grades - so don't take this course if you're anxious about grades/need to know your grades","dr"
97663,"I would recommend this course to another student. I only took this course to satisfy my second science requirement (after Meg Urry's course Expanding Ideas of Time and Space), and by the end of it I was questioning whether or not I should continue pursuing astronomy. Although I would warn others of the mental strain of taking four-question exams, I really loved being in this introductory class and I think it has great potential of bringing people into astronomy and related majors.","r"
97663,"I would 100% recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their major or whether they need more science credit or not, just take the class. The material is very engaging and interesting. We did a very cool project where we transmitted a message towards a star to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Honestly, this is one of the most interesting class I have taken at Yale so far.","r"
97663,"not a science gut","dr"
97663,"I'd vaguely recommend this course. It's... okay, not exactly memorable, but also if you're looking for a very broad introduction to exoplanets, blackholes, and SETI, it's pretty good.","neu"
97663,"Yes I would.","r"
97663,"Absolutely! One of my favorites and arguably the least stressful class I took this semester. Enjoyed engaging with the material so much. Really glad I took this course.","r"
97663,"Yes. It is a great introduction to the development of life on Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. It is also a ""taste"" of physics for the non-STEM majors who are a little curious!","r"
97663,"Yes! If you can handle the frustration of long problem sets, I think the content is worth knowing. It's interesting, and while I did complete this class for the distributional, I was pleasantly surprised by my interest in the topic.","r"
97663,"I would if they're interested in it, but I would want to warn them about how much of the learning is self-driven and researched online as opposed to in class.","r"
97663,"Absolutely not. The professor gave brash responses when students had questions and did not know how to teach a lecture full of generally non-stem students.","dr"
97663,"No. I would tell another student that the content could be quite interesting at times, but the workload and time commitment of the problems sets were a huge burden every week and were barely ever content actually covered in lecture, almost always independent research questions. If we did not research certain aspects in our response, we would get points off for not being specific.  I would only recommend this course to a student who is not already taking on a big workload and who has a background in science and would enjoy learning about the topic of the class. If they have the time and willingness to put in the effort, they will enjoy the class, but most people I knew in the class were not expecting this level of work and had a negative experience.","dr"
97663,"Yes! Its intriguing and manageable.","r"
97663,"Yes!","r"
97663,"Yes easy class overall and good science credit","r"
97663,"I would recommend for anyone who wants an intro about astronomy and the search for life outside of earth.","r"
97663,"Even though it was my fourth class of the day, I never had any issue with focusing, and really enjoyed every minute of it. Even if you are not interested in astronomy, no one can deny how amazing some of the visuals presented during lecture can be. There is a great mix of facts, math, theorizing, and plain fun that make this a course I would recommend to anyone. Also, my experience at the Yale planetarium and observatory was a highlight of the semester, and I definitely plan on visiting again next year.","r"
97663,"No. The course content is interesting, but the same knowledge could be gained simply by reading the assigned textbook independently.","dr"
97663,"It is an easy science credit despite the number of problem sets that you will need to do in this class. Still, the class was interesting, and I learned a lot about extraterrestrial life in the universe.","r"
97663,"YES!! Really amazing course for science or non-science majors alike.","r"
97663,"Maybe not, it is not really a science gut, and it is hard to keep up with because of how it is organised","dr"
97663,"Not really. If you're interested in astronomy, learn some physics and take a real introductory astronomy course. If you're interested in extraterrestrial life, you can lear about the same content by briefly scrolling through the internet. This course sounded really good in theory and the astronomy portion of it was well-taught, but all of the other content was covered in such a simplistic manner that it really isn't worth your time. I think the interdisciplinary nature of the class is very cool and the reading list is good, but the execution was pretty poor. The p-sets are long enough and test questions random enough that it doesn't end up being much of a gut. So not a gut and not very interesting unfortunately.","dr"
97663,"I'd recommend this course only to someone who's desperate for a science credit and interested in the subject matter. It was poorly taught and organized and I've taken better intro astro classes for non-majors at Yale. But as I said, the subject matter was interesting, and out of the field of options I had for science credits this semester I still think it was the best choice for me. The drawbacks weren't so bad that they ruined the class, it was just annoying at times. I'd just recommend forming a group to work on psets together and study for exams.","dr"
97663,"Overall yes. Its not an easy science gut, you definitely have to put a lot of effort into the piece sets. But overall a good and really interesting course thats worth it if youre willing to put in the effort.","r"
97663,"Yes! A great way to earn a Science credit and an interesting topic to learn about, no matter how much you already knew about astronomy.","r"
97663,"Professor Faison is a good lecturer, and the class is very thought-provoking even if I found some of the math on the p-sets a bit of a drag. Not to feat, though, math is only a small portion of the course, and it's very interesting if science-fiction and the extraterrestrial is something you're intrigued by.","r"
97663,"Yes I would recommend it if you need a QR or science credit and don't want to work ridiculously hard. I wouldn't consider this course a gut but it is definitely easier than many intensive stem courses at Yale.","r"
97663,"Absolutely. It was so fun","r"
97663,"Sure, if youre interested.","r"
97663,"Yes very much so. It is very interesting and having an understanding of SETI and space is something everyone should have.","r"
97663,"Yes if you take it with a group of friends and work on the psets together.","r"
97663,"I would since it is a good class to take for a science requirement.","r"
97663,"I really admire the enthusiasm Michael puts into his class, but one thing I think really needs to be improved on is on-time feedback for students, and accurate reflection of grades on canvas. sometimes I would receive the grades on Gradescope, but they are not reflected accurately on canvas (which is due to the grading policy, but still I would wish for a quicker turnover to canvas). Otherwise I would totally recommend this class, learning about potential extraterrestrial life is incredible, especially sending the message in the end of the semester is really exciting. hopefully we can get a reply!","r"
97663,"It depends. I was looking for a science credit as a non-science person, and for that purpose, this class was a good fit.","neu"
97663,"Yes","r"
97663,"Absolutely 1000% yes. I highly recommend this course to all. In addition to being an amazing science credit, this course is particularly useful to humanities majors, especially those in writing intensive majors as many of the topics that are covered in this course have inspired great writers such as Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ray Bradbury, and Kim Stanley Robinson. This class is applicable to all majors, and the topics are sure to inspire anyone. They certainly have inspired me. The class itself is a low threat environment, meaning psets and tests are more than reasonable, manageable, and inclusive (you don't need to be a STEM major to excel here). Additionally, towards the end of the course Doctor Faison takes the class to the observatory for a planetarium show and an observing session, which is an incredible experience and sure to be a major highlight of your semester if you take this course!! I also strongly recommend to students Doctor Faison's other classes, such as ASTR 110 and 120, which are great compliments to this class.","r"
97663,"Not really it was disorganized which made it stressful to try to keep up. Also the grading policy seemed almost random so not knowing where you stand is also stressful.","dr"
97663,"I would recommend this course to other Humanities majors looking for a science credit, but beware that the level of explanation on the work is somewhat arbitrary and much of the content we are assessed on is not actually discussed in class nor is it explained in the readings. To complete the P-sets, you must do individual research. The same problem arose to a lesser extent on the exams, but these could be answered with deductive reasoning and logic rather than specific content discussed in lecture.","r"
97663,"I wouldnt. I enjoyed learning, but the workload was something that took me away from my other classes. I mean to say that for something I only cared about tangentially, the work took me away from my subjects too much.","dr"
97663,"If you're looking for a science credit without too much math, this could work for you (nothing too complicated, only basic algebra and trig). Psets can be tedious but are doable.","neu"
97670,"This is a good introductory course to MATLAB and its applications in cell simulation.","r"
97670,"only if its a requirement","neu"
97670,"For the BME major, this is a required course. I would recommend it, but with the caveat that this course, if not changed in any way, will be very boring (almost unbearably so) for the first half of term, and then much more rigorous and enjoyable in the second half. If a student wants a more rigorous introduction to programming in general, I would not recommend this course, as it has a very niche focus (fascinating, but niche nonetheless).","r"
97670,"This class is not the easiest I have taken but it was extremely necessary and helpful for the greater scope of biomedical engineering.","neu"
97670,"Yes. If you are a biomedical engineering student, this class integrates biology, mathematics, and computer science in a really applicable and interesting way.","r"
97670,"This is a BME requirement. I also highly recommend this course for people new to coding who are interested in applying computational skills to biology and want a light introduction.","r"
97670,"If they are a biomedical engineering student, then yes.","r"
97670,"Yes for basics in matlab and an easily and applicable intro programming class.","r"
97670,"Yes if they are a BME major or want to learn matlab.","r"
97670,"Not unless it's a major requirement","dr"
97670,"Great for engineering students and math/S&DS majors. Development of coding skills alongside modeling and statistical interpretations is useful and applicable to areas outside the course, especially if you are conducting research or taking other learning labs (e.g. physics labs, BME labs)","r"
97670,"If a student is planning to use MATLAB for biological modeling in the future, and has no experience with MATLAB, I would very much recommend it, because the course starts with the fundamentals of how MATLAB stores data, etc. I would say that it's probably best if you go into this class with some previous programming knowledge, as some of the more universal aspects of programming (for example, being able to easily understand conditional statements or logic trees, matching indices, etc.) are not addressed in enormous detail.","r"
97670,"Not really, but you dont have a choice if youre a BME major. This class was not as hard as Physio but it is very poorly taught. I struggled to pay attention in class and it didnt seem like either the Professor or TFs cared if we were struggling with the material. While its not as hard as CS50, if you dont have a background in programming you start out at a significant disadvantage. The exams are not too hard but theyre very harshly graded so always pay attention to detail when studying code. Although I gained a solid introduction to the basics of MATLAB, I dont feel qualified to write code for a research project involving real life data.","dr"
97670,"Yes","r"
97670,"I would, but only if its a major requirement. I think another computing course, like a CS class would be more fun and engaging for those genuinely interested in coding. The PSETs also take a long time each week and it is necessary to complete them with others as it is difficult to complete on ones own.","r"
97670,"No, although it is a requirement for the major","dr"
97673,"No. Only if you have to take it for BME. So difficult and time consuming","dr"
97673,"I would not rec based off of difficulty.","dr"
97673,"not if you don't have to.","dr"
97673,"Yes, BME requirement but KMJ is a good professor and the content is interesting and engaging","r"
97673,"If you want to learn about kinetics, this is an (albeit-intense) course I could recommend.","r"
97673,"I would recommend this course to another student because the content is very interesting and the course is taught in an engaging manner.","r"
97673,"I would not recommend this course to anyone who doesn't have to take it. It is too difficult to justify taking without it being a requirement. If someone wants to learn the material for their own sake, I would recommend auditing or taking it for a credit instead of a grade.","dr"
97673,"I would not recommend this class unless it is a requirement. The material is dense and complicated and uninteresting if you do not like learning about diffusion.","dr"
97673,"It was a good course but unless your a BME major the work is not worth it","neu"
97673,"This is a requirement for BME majors. I would also recommend this course to chemical engineering, biology, or biochemistry majors who are interested in gaining a broad background in biological transport phenomenon.","r"
97673,"You should only take this if you are BME. If you are another engineering major, this class is definitely more biologically oriented than other engineering classes. Would highly recommend taking this after MENG 361.","r"
97676,"Only take this course if you absolutely have to. It is very difficult and a lot of PSETs and not as engaging as I would have hoped","dr"
97676,"Yes, Staib and Duncan are great professors and the course is well organized and engaging.","r"
97676,"There are better classes to gain understanding of the same topics.","dr"
97676,"This course is well-structured and gives the impression of a course that wishes to teach the subject matter rather than a class that is trying to shove the information in.","r"
97676,"Only if you need it for BME","neu"
97676,"I would recommend this course to people who want an introduction to signals and its relation to the medical field. It doesnt take a small amount of work to succeed, but it is worth it to understand the topic.","r"
97676,"I would recommend this course to another student because the knowledge gained in the course is applicable to many different areas of medicine and the course maintains a good balance between mathematical and science concepts.","r"
97676,"Definitely don't take it if you're not BME. If you think the material might be interesting, you're probably better off learning it in a different imaging/signals class. Staib's half of the course was not engaging, contained way too much information on the powerpoints, and tested topics that we did not have enough practice with. Duncan's half of the course was more interesting and he was much more transparent about questions that would be covered on exams, but still pretty challenging. Overall, the course feels very disjointed because their styles of teaching and the material they covered were so different -- it almost felt like I was taking two classes at once. Also, don't be fooled by the exams being open note... they are some of the most challenging exams I've taken in the major.","dr"
97676,"If you are BME major, you need to take this course.","neu"
97676,"I would only recommend this if you are BME. There are a lot of concepts that are overlooked and having EENG 200 as a prerequisite is a great help as the math and concepts are similar.","neu"
97684,"Yes, this course is very interesting and it discuss many important and fundamental concepts.","r"
97684,"I would recommend this course to another student because it not only provides a strong knowledge foundation but it allows you to be up to date with scientific literature as well.","r"
97684,"Students in the biomedical engineering track would probably enjoy this course, especially compared to the other courses in their major. For non-STEM majors, this class is pretty difficult in terms of the material but not so much the workload.","r"
97684,"100% yes, manageable workload, interesting concepts, professor is very experienced and engaging","r"
97684,"unless the grading scheme for this course gets some serious overhaul, it is not worth your stress. Amazing content, just wish i could appreciate this material without having to constantly worry about random points taken off.","dr"
97684,"Yes, if youre interested in biomolecular/tissue engineering.","r"
97684,"Yes! Super cool class maybe if taking for credit.","r"
97684,"Yes","r"
97684,"Yes, even for students who have no background in biomedical engineering, this course was engaging and comprehendible. This course well provided a nice integration of the human immune system with scientific understanding.","r"
97684,"I would not recommend this course to another student. It is simply not worth the pain that comes from learning about biomaterials and how the body reacts to them. The unstructured nature of the course made it difficult to know what we were learning and how it all related to each other. Furthermore, the grading made it feel as if there was a heavier emphasis on copying every word that was said rather than understanding the material.","dr"
97684,"Yes it was so cool","r"
97684,"Yes, because you learn a lot and the course material is interesting. Just be aware that you need to pay close attention to lectures in order to do well on exams.","r"
97684,"Yes, the information was great and well communicated. Appreciated no homework to allow us to focus on our research.","r"
97684,"Yes, I think the course content is super unique and cool to learn about if you have any interest in biomedical devices or pathology. This is also a low-stress course thanks to its low workload and no discussion section (you really only need to do a few assignments, attend class, and prep well for exams), so it's easier to enjoy and focus on understanding the material.","r"
97684,"Yes I definitely would. I loved the content and it really made me think about medical devices in a new light.","r"
97684,"Definitely, I recommend it to anyone in BME to fulfill their electives","r"
97684,"don't take this course","dr"
97691,"Definitely!","r"
97691,"Yes if you have a sufficient math and coding background. Biology background is least important, but of course helpful. Expect quite a bit of self teaching, and performance is very dependent on TAs.","r"
97691,"I would recommend this course to another student. The math we learn about is quite interesting on its own, and seeing how it can be applied to biology gives me a newfound appreciation for the world.","r"
97691,"Yes! The course is divided into three sections (one per prof), so it's likely that there's something for everyone's interests while being able to explore other fields.","r"
97691,"I would suggest this course to my peers, but only to those that are interested in modeling in biology, know some coding languages, and have a strong physical and mathematical background","r"
97691,"Yeah. Very responsible lecturers!","r"
97691,"I would recommend this course if you have a strong interest in either neurological models or models of bacterial chemotaxis, as these subjects are explored in rigorous detail. However, if you're uninterested in those subjects, you may not enjoy a full two-thirds of the course, and the mathematical content of the first third could likely be obtained elsewhere.","r"
97691,"Helpful for getting grounded in performing simulations and modeling in matlab as it applies to biological systems.","neu"
97691,"For students interested in system biology and physical modeling to biological system. This is a terrific course.","r"
97766,"Yes, but you should be interested in linguistics or cognitive science. The content gets kind of dense in certain parts of the course.","r"
97766,"I would! This course is different than anything else Ive taken at Yale, and Ive enjoyed learning the material. Although the workload is very reasonable, it is a bit sporadic and exams were stressful.","r"
97766,"Yes, if you're interested in linguistics or language and cognitive science.","r"
97766,"If you like linguistics then sure. I didn't know if I would or not so I took the course and discovered that I don't really. I kind of regret taking the class but also it wasn't that bad and I can understand how others would find it interesting.","neu"
97766,"No. If you need a linguistics course, there are probably better ones. This class did not live up to its name well. And if it did, it was too poorly structured and organized for me to understand anything.","dr"
97766,"Yes, definitely. Professor Frank is articulate, kind, and funny. He makes lectures very engaging.","r"
97766,"If you truly love linguistics or you are planning to credit D the course, yes. If you're not fully interested in the content or linguistics does not come naturally to you, it's hard to stay engaged and keep up, as some of the content is very technical.","neu"
97766,"I would recommend this course to another student if they are really interested in linguistics.","r"
97766,"Yes definitely. Learned a lot of interesting stuff.","r"
97766,"Only if you think you will be engaged in learning about linguistic structures and experiments every week. It is easy to lose motivation and cease to get much out of the class. Prof. Frank is very nice and actually does a good job making lectures as interesting/engaging as possible, but it is still tough to stay focused if you're not too interested in the topic. The workload is low, though dates for homework assignments are not decided ahead of time, but you always have several days to complete them. The midterm and final were maybe the most creative exams I have taken here; they required application beyond memorization and were somewhat difficult but curved.","neu"
97766,"Again, I would only recommend this to Linguistics majors, this is not a class for first-time linguistics learners.","r"
97766,"No. Only if you have background in linguistics. I have background in cognitive science and found it very difficult.","dr"
97766,"Yes especially if you love the subject","r"
97766,"Yes, if you are interested in linguistics specifically. I took the course as a way to better understand cognition and LLMs, and think I probably could have done without some of the depth in certain areas. Overall a great introduction to an interesting field; would recommend.","r"
97766,"I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning about linguistics.","r"
97766,"Absolutely.","r"
97766,"If you are interested in cognitive science or linguistics, then absolutely. Or honestly, even if you aren't, this class offers a good introduction to both and Bob Frank is an incredible lecturer, so if it sounds interesting, take it!","r"
97766,"Yes, it's a very interesting course for anyone, no background required.","r"
97766,"I would recommend this course to another student. The workload is manageable, but you come away having taken in clear takeaways about the nature of cognition and language which you can apply to future linguistics or cognitive science classes.","r"
97766,"The exams are hard but if you are interested in linguistics this might be an interesting course.","neu"
97766,"I don't think so. Lectures had some engaging material, but were largely repetitive and rushed. While there was not a substantial amount of homework, it was challenging as it often covered a topic that we barely touched on in lecture","dr"
97766,"I would recommend the course to students who are interested in cognitive science AND linguistics. Despite this being an intro course, it's not easy and the grading is on the harsher side. Aside from the exams, the class is very enjoyable.","r"
97766,"for cognitive science prerequisites, yes","r"
97766,"I would recommend this class but it definitely has some challenging concepts so as long as they are okay with that then yes I would recommend this course.","r"
97766,"If you are very interested in linguistics, then yes.","r"
97766,"I would recommend for someone who is interested in the topic","r"
97766,"As someone with prior experience with linguistics and who wanted to take this course to expand and deepen that knowledge, I greatly enjoyed this class. However, I could understand how someone primarily interested in cognitive science would struggle with what we covered or find it boring. It mainly applied linguistic ideas in a cognitive framework, and sometimes we would learn certain linguistic ideas without the cognition aspect, or it wouldn't be incorporated for a while. In my opinion, I felt like there was a good mix of topics that excited me and those that I could have done without. Still, I do feel like I had an understanding of why we were learning everything that we did. It was also a class where I did not have to devote a huge amount of energy to understanding what I learned and perform well on assignments. I really only needed to do work leading up to the exams. So I would recommend if you are remotely interested in linguistics, its relation to cognitive science, and want a relatively low work course.","neu"
97766,"Only if you are interested in linguistics, do NOT take this as a psychology course.","dr"
97806,"Yes, if they are interested in chemistry and if it is a prerequisite requirement.","r"
97806,"Unless they absolutely need a science credit or must take this course as a requirement for the major, I would not","dr"
97806,"I would recommend this to anyone who needs to take the course as a prerequisite/foundational course but also anyone looking for a science credit who is interested in learning about chemistry.","r"
97806,"I would recommend taking general chemistry with Professor Cooper if you get the chance.","r"
97806,"I would not recommend this course to anyone who is not majoring in a science based major.","dr"
97806,"If your major requires this course.","neu"
97806,"Yes but be prepared to put in the work that's necessary","r"
97806,"If you are taking it as a prerequisite, you dont really have another choice. Good luck. While the material is interesting, the tests are too short on time to think through appropriately, and the homework is quite a time commitment every week. That being said, Cooper is an incredibly sweet teacher, and he will explain everything to you if you ask. But he isnt the one at discussion section, making it hard to get a hold of him since youd have to either ask in class or make an appointment. I would only take it if you need to, its not worth it if you simply are taking it for fun.","neu"
97806,"I would definitely recommend this course, especially with this professor, to any Science majors or people looking for a practical Science class for the credit.","r"
97806,"no unless you have to","dr"
97806,"Yes especially if you have less background in Chemistry and you will need to take higher level chemistry","r"
97806,"I would recommend it if you need it for a prerequisite. Otherwise, you really dont have to take this class. There are better and more stimulating classes to take for a science credit.","neu"
97806,"I would reccomend this coulrde only to those preparing to major in a stem-related major. It has many crucial fundumentalds.","r"
97806,"I would recommend this course to another student only if it is required the workload can be tough if trying to manage with other PSET heavy courses/essays.","neu"
97806,"I wouldnt really recommend because the lectures werent engaging and I kinda just learned everything while doing the homeworks last minute.","dr"
97806,"Depends on why- if you are generally interested or a STEM major looking to understand why things work the way they do at a basic level, this course is a must in developing a fundamental understanding of the physical world.","neu"
97806,"yes if it is taught by paul cooper","r"
97806,"Yes, most definitely!","r"
97806,"Yes! It is easy to succeed in this class, if you use the resources correctly! It is easy to fall behind, but the key is to just make sure you study for the exams and you should be alright! They drop a few of the lowest scores on certain things too!","r"
97811,"Yes, this was an interesting chemistry class and I found it more interesting than Gen Chem I actually.","r"
97811,"Yes; basic class","r"
97811,"No - not if you don't need it for a prerequisite. Maybe if you need it for a Science credit.","dr"
97811,"Yes I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in entering science fields or taking a premedical route.","r"
97811,"Yes. Make sure you read the textbook since the exam content comes more from the textbook than the lectures.","r"
97811,"Only if you have to, but even then I would try to avoid it. This course was one of the reasons I quit pre-med. I used to like chemistry but I found the way this course was taught to be incredibly boring and unhelpful. I often only understood the content when I used outside resources.","dr"
97811,"I would urge students considering taking this course (either as a prerequisite, as a distribution requirement, or for fun) to look at the ratings of the professor who will be teaching. The quality of the professor will be what determines whether your time in this class will be worthwhile or awful","neu"
97811,"I would recommend this course to another student only if they need a prerequisite. Not something just to take to take.","r"
97811,"Yes, I did learn a lot. The TAs were great and I may be biased, but I enjoy chemistry and think others should learn more about it.","r"
97811,"Only if required for your major or pre-med.","neu"
97811,"Yes, if you are pre-med as it is a requirement.","r"
97811,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It was very manageable.","r"
97811,"Yes, it is a necessary course for anyone interested in pursuing STEM fields.","r"
97811,"I would recommend this course for students entering STEM related fields as this is almost necessary to fully understand the general chemistry material. It sets a good foundation for the future and it is especially important if you are going to organic chemistry in the following semesters.","r"
97811,"No. By far one of the worst taught classes I have taken at Yale","dr"
97811,"Necessary for major otherwise no","dr"
97811,"I would recommend this course because it is an important course to build foundational concepts in chemistry.","r"
97811,"no, unless if you absolutely must take this class and even then, take it with another professor","dr"
97811,"I would never recommend this course to another student, because even if you are very smart and study a lot, it seems like a total dice roll to get an A because others will cheat and get extremely high scores on the exam, making the curve extremely difficult for those who do not.","dr"
97811,"No, I would definitely not recommend this class unless the student needs it as a pre-requisite or for pre-med requirements.","dr"
97811,"I would, Dr. Parr is great.","r"
97811,"If youre going to take this course, its probably because its a requirement, so yes if you are committed to your major and it requires this course then take it. Definitely not a class youd simply take for fun though. The course is doable.","neu"
97811,"Yes, I think that the material of this course is important to learn, especially for students pursuing the medical path.","r"
97811,"No I think this class was not well taught and we could use more clear instructions to understand the concepts.","dr"
97811,"Definitely not. Obviously, you are not just taking this course just for fun, so if you have to take it, take a deep breath and get ready to self-teach the class to yourself the whole semester.","dr"
97811,"Depends on who is teaching CHEM 165. If it is Jonathan Parr, then no, I would not recommend.","dr"
97811,"Yes, it can be frustrating but it is designed for students to succeed.","r"
97811,"I would not recommend this course to another student unless they were required to take it for their major or postgraduate study. This course is NOT a gut due to the current format of the exams. This course was incredibly stressful and every lecture was a struggle to get through. There were some demonstrations; however, for the most part, Prof. Parr would ramble for some twenty minutes at a time. It was hard to focus and remain engaged in class. Almost no one asked questions during a lecture or participated as they were most likely lost on the topic being explained. Sometimes, it felt that Prof. Parr expected us to intuitively know certain concepts despite us learning them for the first time. If you take this course, make sure you go to Office Hours every week and do lots of practice problems ahead of the exams!","dr"
97811,"Yes if needed for major requirement or otherwise","r"
97811,"if required for their major","neu"
97811,"Only if you need it for your major. If you can, I would try to place out of Gen Chem and start with Organic Chemistry, as Gen Chem is not very applicable to anything necessary in your STEM career.","neu"
97811,"No I would not recommend. Difficult topic.","dr"
97811,"Given the disorganization, poor teaching, and strange exam format, I would not recommend this course to another student. However, I understand that it is simply a requirement that many students will have to take regardless.","dr"
97811,"No unless it is a requirement","dr"
97811,"I would recommend this course to another student as a good way of developing crucial STEM skills.","r"
97811,"Probably not. I liked the content okay, but it is an intro class that you're taking just to get through it. If you have to take it, then take it.","dr"
97811,"Not unless you have to take it. Its doable if you do, so dont be intimidated, but this will not be a fun intellectually challenging class to add. Especially if Dr. Parr is teaching.","dr"
97811,"Yes. Well, I mean, if you are a STEM major then you have no choice LOLZ.","r"
97811,"Yes! Gives you a good foundation of general chemistry","r"
97811,"Absolutely not. This was the worst class I have taken in my entire life. I understand that it is necessary for a lot of majors' requirements, but I would really try to avoid it if you can. I showed up to every single lecture and I came out understanding nothing. I only began to understand things thanks to my wonderful TA and the psets. The lectures were genuinely so unhelpful, and I honestly think my performance would have been better if I did the psets during lecture time instead of paying attention to the lecture.","dr"
97811,"Absolutely not. There are many issues with both the teaching and assessment style of this course, and if you must take it for a prerequisite, I would not do so until these have been fixed.","dr"
97811,"I would not recommend this course to another student if it is taught by Professor Parr. His teaching style made it difficult to learn and there was little opportunity to receive help.","dr"
97811,"Yes, I would. Although this course can be challenging and a lot of work, the knowledge you gain is critical for the sciences and especially pre-med requirements.","r"
97811,"I might recommend the course with a different professor.","neu"
97811,"Yes, I learned so much more about chemistry and it applications in the real world.","r"
97811,"Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in chemistry, medicine, or science in general. Although it is a general chemistry course, it presents several applications to medical and biological industries. For example, we learned about different biological macromolecule structures and how they are targeted by commercial drugs. We also discussed how many forms of medical imaging use nuclear chemistry to produce highly-complex images of internal structures.","r"
97811,"I would only recommend if they have to take it for their major.","neu"
97811,"Only if you have to take it.","neu"
97811,"Yes!","r"
97811,"Yes. Gen Chem 2 is a good class for you to further explore your possible interest in the field of chemistry and be exposed to challenging new ideas.","r"
97811,"I would recommend this course to another student because it is foundational to later chemistry courses.","r"
97811,"Not a chance. I know a lot of people have to take this course, but it was unnecessarily difficult for no reason.","dr"
97811,"I would recommend this course to another Yale student. It advances the foundational knowledge of the chemical world and ensures that students are successful for more advanced chemistry courses.","r"
97811,"Yes, because it is required.","r"
97811,"Yes, this course was highly interesting and informative.","r"
97811,"I would recommend the course if the student is interested in chemistry and is self sufficient in learning content on their own.","r"
97811,"Yes this class is important to understanding the basics of chemistry.","r"
97811,"N/a","neu"
97811,"I would recommend this course to another student as this course is a nice introduction and preparation for chemistry courses at Yale. It is also a good continuation to CHEM 161 as it builds upon the material learned in the previous class.","r"
97811,"I would recommend this course to another student that is interested in chemistry and biology and also enjoyed CHEM 161.","r"
97811,"If you have to take this for a requirement, it has some interesting content and will be doable. The organic chemistry in the end is interesting, and equilibrium is a foundational part of biology. In case you are looking for a class to get exposed to chemistry or take a bit of a dive, it would probably be more helpful to take a class thats more accessible and applied to the field youre interested in. This course was pretty poorly formatted, with lectures being hard to follow and a slightly combative professor-student relationship. Tests were hour long, 7-question, open-book Canvas pages that were online with very little work shown, though the lowest-score midterm drop was helpful. Overall, unless youre passionate about chemistry, there is a lot not to like about this class, though some content is interesting and you will learn a good bit if you personally apply yourself well beyond what happens in class.","neu"
97811,"I would recommend this course to another student although I would advise that review some of the organic chemistry material early as that is rushed through a little bit near the end","r"
97811,"Yes. There are so many resources this course offers that it's somehow possible to use none of them and do well in the class and use all of them and do well in the class. I felt that the amount of information given in Chem 165 is much more easily digestible than Chem 161.","r"
97811,"I wouldn't unless necessary. I found it unnecessarily stressful and frustrating and that took away from learning the material.","dr"
97811,"All bio/chem students have to take this course, so it would be great if chem 165 could be improved! This course would have been better if we had a more understanding and welcoming instructor.","neu"
97811,"I would recommend this course to other students who look to further their foundational knowledge in chemistry as well as STEM fields. As well as for those looking to take a course with a professor who looks at more than just the textbook to teach the material.","r"
97811,"This course is a stepping stone for most stem students either way. Take it if you love chemistry. If not, make sure to attend lectures, go to discussion sections, and read the textbook.","neu"
97811,"I would recommend this class for a student who is very interested in the subject and is willing to put a lot of independent work into the class.","r"
97811,"No. Only take it if absolutely necessary.","dr"
97811,"If they are in STEM and need an introductory course to chemistry, definitely! I certainly learned about many different topics of chemistry, ranging from electrochemistry to aqueous solutions. While I do not think all the material will be helpful for those taking the MCAT, it is very useful if you need to fulfill more chemistry requirements in the future.","r"
97811,"I might recommend it because it fulfills a requirement for some science majors, but if you are intending to be serious about chemistry or prefer a more in-depth education I would recommend Advanced General Chemistry more than this.","neu"
97811,"no, i would not recommend this class unless you absolutely have to take it because the instructor is not supportive of student learning, the exams do not reflect the course material, and it is overall not engaging or intellectually stimulating","dr"
97811,"I would only recommend this course to another student if it is required for either pre-med requirements or for their specific major. This course is a rather challenging and intense introductory lecture, and it is not a great choice for students simply looking to complete a science requirement who may not be completely interested or engaged with the material to begin with.","neu"
97811,"I would recommend this course to a student who is serious about entering a career in the medical field or in Chemistry, but otherwise I would not recommend this course if a student is not considering a career in STEM.","neu"
97811,"Yes, it is interesting.","r"
97811,"No unless it was required.","dr"
97811,"I would recommend this course to another student. The recorded lectures allows you to take the course at your own pace and the discussion section teachers all help greatly in processing the information. Professor Parr is very generous with his grading and is easily approachable if you have any problems.","r"
97811,"if you need to take general chemistry, I wouldn't worry too much about the class. it feels a lot different than Chem 161, mainly because of the different teaching styles between the two classes. that was difficult because I came into the class with an expectation that it would resemble the first semester of general chemistry, and when it didn't, it took me a while to adapt. However, if you consistently study and keep up with lectures, I think it is very possible to succeed in this class","neu"
97835,"Absolutely, especially if they want an in-depth discussion of thermodynamics.","r"
97835,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a more fulfilling version of general chemistry or who is looking to get a very good introduction to thermodynamics.","r"
97835,"Yes, I would.","r"
97835,"Yes. Some lectures may be difficult, but MJ does a great job answering questions in class and emails to address any confusion. Ultimately its the pace that drives the difficulty because its a lot of information at once but reading Oxtoby prior to or following the lectures is great.","r"
97835,"Yes. I would take this course taught by Dr. Johnson over the regular general chemistry 2 course. This course seemed to have a more interesting curriculum. The smaller size of the course allows for a closer relationship between students and both the professor and TFs.","r"
97835,"I would absolutely recommend this course. It was incredibly interesting and the right amount of challenging. I feel like I have a much stronger grasp of chemistry and am even interested in majoring in it now!","r"
97835,"I would only recommend this course if you really like chemistry and are actually good at otherwise it is much smarter to just take Chem 165 because it is so much easier to do well in that course.","neu"
97835,"No because the stress was disproportionately spaced in the course","dr"
97835,"Yes. It is a great course.","r"
97835,"Yes! From what I've heard about 165, I honestly think this course is easier (this was a very pleasant surprise after finishing 163!). The workload is very manageable, exams are fair, grading policy is very generous (don't have to finish entire exam, one is dropped, PSets graded for completion). If you took AP chemistry, you're very well-prepared.","r"
97835,"Yes but be prepared to do more work than is needed to get the chemistry credit","r"
97835,"Yes, because I think that it helped build a good foundation of chemistry that even if not applicable to other fields, at least made sense and was cool to understand.","r"
97835,"Yes I would recommend this course to other students. It was very beneficial to me in developing my understanding of chemistry and reshaping how I think about science in general.","r"
97844,"It's challenging.","neu"
97844,"Yes! I think that the course is extremely well-taught and organized. Scott Miller is a fantastic professor who actually makes me want to take other organic chemistry courses, even though they are not required for me. Being in such a small class in this first-year version is fantastic in that I get to meet and know people with academic interests similar to mine. Taking a full-year course like this has really brought us all closer together in an amazing way.","r"
97844,"Yes, absolutely. If you have a chance to take this course as a first year student you should.","r"
97844,"It's required for most students who are taking it. Regardless, I would recommend it because Miller is an incredibly prof who is clearly very passionate about what he does. The TAs are also great. Just know that you will have to put in a lot of time to study for the exams.","r"
97844,"Yes. It's awesome. Professor Miller is awesome. It's a low-workload course outside of tests, so you can dedicate most of your time in this course to studying the material how you like. If you are a first-year who needs to take organic chemistry anyways, I think that CHEM 175 with Professor Miller is a way better move than taking CHEM 220/221.","r"
97844,"I loved this course so I would recommend it. I love chemistry in general so I loved everything in the class.","r"
97844,"I would, but perhaps CHEM 174 instead of CHEM 175.","neu"
97844,"Yes, especially if Professor Miller is teaching!!!","r"
97844,"Its hard, not for the faint of heart","dr"
97844,"Definitely. Its a great way to test yourself intellectually and learn to think in a new way.","r"
97844,"For any people interested in chemistry, this course is great.","r"
97844,"Yes. I would not have the same level of appreciation for organic chemistry if not for this course.","r"
97844,"I definitely would recommend this class to anyone in their premed journey. While this class is difficult, it will teach you the necessary skills to succeed in harder courses that you will take later on. Also Miller is great lecturer that will make organic chemistry interesting (and not just bland mechanisms). He relates each lecture to some Nobel prize research and gives examples of when each reaction is used in medicinal chemistry.","r"
97844,"I would recommend this course to students who have an interest in organic chemistry. This class is not super easy and you have to be willing to attend office hours and review sessions to do well on the exams.","r"
97844,"100%. The people (TAs and prof and classmates) made this one of the best parts of my first year at Yale. I had no idea that I had any interest in chemistry before taking this class and it has inspired me to pursue higher level courses in chemistry that relate to my primary interest in bio. It is so well supported and there is nothing like the camaraderie that emerged from this tight-knit class. I also found my best friends here!","r"
97844,"I would if you are premed or need this course otherwise but it is a lot of work for an exploratory course.","r"
97844,"I would recommend this course to anyone interested in organic chemistry! It is very well-taught and made to be exciting. However, the exams are quite difficult so you need to really make sure you have a strong grasp of the material.","r"
97844,"If you need orgo 2 or like chem","neu"
97844,"If required or very interested in the material","neu"
97844,"Yes, second semester organic chemistry gives you the knowledge to identify how many modern medicines function, and it would be valuable for pre-med students, students studying chemistry or related science, and any student that would like to understand the basics of medicine synthesis.","r"
97844,"I would, as Professor Miller is a great professor and the first year environment makes learning very fun","r"
97844,"Yes it was fun","r"
97844,"I would absolutely recommend this course. I appreciate there being a separate course for first-year students studying orgo because I felt very close to the other students in the class and appreciated the smaller lecture.","r"
97844,"Only to chem majors","neu"
97844,"If you are interested at all, do take it. First-Year Organic Chemistry is not a chance to miss.","r"
97844,"Yes, probably. I think that this is a very interesting course, where you learn a lot of chemistry that's very relavent and modern. However, it's biggest pitfall is that the tests are WAY too hard, and you are never told what the curve will be. This creates a lot of unnecessary stress. If you're prepared for that, and okay with never knowing your grade, then I would definitely recommend this class.","r"
97844,"I would recommend this class to anyone who is premed and/or an MB&B major. Apart from that, I probably would not recommend because there are way easier science classes than this.","neu"
97844,"Definitely, I think the class was very well taught and I feel much more comfortable doing organic problems. I also really liked how we saw what we're learning be applied to modern work, like atropisomerism in a cancer drug.","r"
97844,"I would recommend this class to another student but I would say that coming into this class you must have a strong grasp on the material covered in first semester orgo and must be willing to dedicate time to reading the textbook, working through practice problems, and understanding concepts. The exams are difficult, and if your class consists of many chemistry majors as mine did, it will often feel like you are behind. However, I learned a lot from this class as someone who really does enjoy organic chemistry.","r"
97844,"Yes, it was very informative for my knowledge of chemistry","r"
97844,"I feel like this course is rite of passage for most students going into med school or chemistry, but unlike my first semester of organic chemistry, this semester is much harder. This could have been due to the combination of teachers we had (Herzon who made his class a little easier and then Miller whos exams are very difficult) or it could have just been","neu"
97844,"I'm very biased toward recommending organic chemistry to other students because I love it so much, but I think it's particularly enjoyable for students who enjoy the more qualitative, creative side of science like me. Sometimes when we focus too much on raw computation, the elegance and interconnectedness of a field can get obscured.","neu"
97844,"I would, as organic chemistry is an important and interesting subject and CHEM 175 is a great way to learn more about the topic.","r"
97844,"Yes, I thought it was super interesting and really enjoyed having taken it, also taught really well, however need a strong foundation in CHEM 174 and it is a lot of time to review notes/practice/etc so make sure you have the time to give it","r"
97856,"I would recommend this course to another student especially if they are pre-med. I think this is a great course to take after organic chemistry 1 and before biochemistry. It covers topics that will be needed for the MCAT and will always prepare you for biochemistry. I felt as though the end of this course was a linkage between organic chemistry and biochemistry.","r"
97856,"Only for their major","neu"
97856,"I would! It builds upon Organic Chemistry 1 knowledge, and I believe that the content goes much more in-depth. The amount of biochemistry was also helpful, because I believe it helped me prepare for Biochemistry next year.","r"
97856,"I would recommend this course if one is really interested in chemical biology, and if of course it is needed as a premed or other school requirement. I found the material really interesting but it could be a lot for one who doesn't have strong background in general chemistry topics.","r"
97856,"its probably a req, so not much choice","neu"
97856,"If you don't have to take the course, i would not recommend it If you do have to take the course, it's better than orgo 1 and, though requires a lot of work, is mostly interesting content","dr"
97856,"You're probably taking Orgo 2 for a requirement, so if you're taking it you're going to take it. STUDY for the exams, keep up on content as the semester goes and ask for practice problems anytime you can.","neu"
97856,"Yes if you plan on taking bio chem in future, this is a good Segway. Very engaging and you actually enjoy what you're learning","r"
97856,"I would only recommend this course to students who are interested in organic chemistry and who are ready to put in the work to practice the content that is being taught in class rigorously outside of class, attend office hours, and build a strong understanding of the content.","r"
97856,"Yes - you likely need to take it for premed/chem major requirements, but I enjoyed the class and I thought the material was interesting. The teaching staff is excellent","r"
97856,"If youre interested in organic chemistry then yes!","r"
97856,"It's not a bad class. Jason is great at explaining concepts and much of what you learn is really interesting. The class would be much better if the grading structure was changed, but it is not bad overall. Especially take this class if Aaron Clark is co-teaching. He is an amazing teacher and cares deeply about his students.","neu"
97856,"Yes, if you are interested in chemistry or need it as a requirement.","r"
97856,"Probably a requirement. If you are interested in biology, take OCHEM II with Crafword. If not, like me, you should probably consider taking it with Scott Miller instead since he talks about topics more relevent to real chemistry.","neu"
97856,"If you dont have to, dont take this course","dr"
97856,"Yes! This class is so cool!","r"
97856,"I would if you have to take it or are premed. I think a lot of what I actually learned is very helpful to future things that align w my interests in medicine.","r"
97856,"I would recommend this course only if it's required by a major or post-grad goals. It's one of the hardest classes at Yale, so I would advise students to proceed with caution.","dr"
97856,"I would if it is required","r"
97856,"I would recommend this course to someone who is looking for a deeper dive into organic chemistry, however I would not recommend it to someone who is simply looking for a science credit.","r"
97856,"I do not recommend this course. I honestly enjoyed first semester orgo and thought that second semester orgo would be the same experience but alas it's definitely NOT. First of all, a third of the course was biochemistry, which although helpful, could be streamlined to be taught way more effectively. What made first year orgo bearable was that we were given reaction, their mechanisms, and problems that we could apply them to. However, second semester ergo is very unorganized and sometimes you learn through examples before even knowing what is the purpose/general idea of what is being taught. Overall, that made it very frustrating when trying to review for exams. My biggest piece of advice would be to read ""Organic Chemistry as a Second Language."" I'm begging you PLEASE READ IT!! I learned more in that book than I did in lecture and it was more than enough for the tests that they administered (except for the third exam which covers chemical biology).","dr"
97856,"Only take this course if it is for your major or you need to do it for premed. Although if you're premed, honestly just skip this class and take biochem instead. There are only like 10-15 med schools that require orgo 2. Save yourself the struggle.","neu"
97856,"Probably not, but most people take this as a requirement anyways. I wish there had been more correlation between what was taught in class and what was tested on the exams, especially the last one. It didnt help that the lectures were done by one person and the exams were written by someone else.","dr"
97856,"No. There is no reason to take this class and struggle on your own if you are not an MB&B major with specifically the Medicine concentration. Credit/D/Fail the class. Even when you may feel that you have learned a lot, it is frustrating to see your scores not reflect that it is quite hard on your mental health. I have felt some of my lowest in my confidence and performance in this class and I have really enjoyed organic chemistry as a topic. The organization of the course is just absurd and I have performed very well in ORGO 1. ORGO 2 is not worth your time and effort and wellbeing.","dr"
97856,"A very well-organized class","r"
97856,"I would not recommend this class to another student unless they are a chem major. While I learned a lot, it felt very disheartening to see that not translate into exams, and as a pre-med student whose strength is not chemistry, I found this class highly challenging.","dr"
97856,"Yes! I really enjoyed it! Especially compared to first semester orgo, the workload felt very manageable.","r"
97856,"Yes, if you need to take it. If you don't have to take it, there really isn't much point in taking this class, as it is just memorization of tons of reactions and mechanisms (though some are definitely interesting).","r"
97856,"Yes! If you liked Orgo I and are interested in how chemistry and biology are related, definitely take this course.","r"
97856,"I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about chemistry from a biological standpoint. The content is challenging but it builds upon each other making this more of a marathon of a class. Content wise the reactions are very intriguing, and I believe learning the mechanisms enabled me to really want to know WHY eat molecule behaves the way it does for the first time.","r"
97856,"Yes for requirements, yes if youre interested in chemistry of biological molecules you do learn a lot about that","r"
97856,"Unless you need it for a major, I would not recommend. This course is run very differently to other chemistry courses. There are no shoe in points in this class. You learn a ton of information, but there are no homework assignments meaning the exams are the entire grade.","dr"
97856,"If you have to take it... you should take it. But I would not recommend taking it for fun.","dr"
97856,"Yes if necessary for pre-med requirements.","r"
97856,"I enjoyed this class a lot more than CHEM 220, but I wouldn't recommend it if it's not needed.","dr"
97856,"I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoyed orgo one and wants to develop their organic chemistry intuition a lot more and see orgo applied to biology.","r"
97856,"Most students take this course as a requirement so it is hard to answer this question. However, i do really enjoy the course's content and have taken organic chemistry courses before in HS and really loved it. However, this particular class I would not recommend to anyone because of how it was structured.","neu"
97856,"If youre taking this course, you probably dont have a choice. Still, Id recommend you take it at another school and get the credit transferred or take it post-bacc.","neu"
97856,"If you really enjoyed orgo 1, then you will be fine in this course. Otherwise... be prepared for a lot of studying and frustration.","neu"
97981,"Definitely useful for humanities/social science majors who need to code, and anyone interested in data science.","r"
97981,"No, there are better CS options","dr"
97981,"I would only take this course if you have previous coding experience. I think the intersection between humanities and social science majors with computer science was lost at times. The professor is amazing; but, the course itself is very difficult and I often had to rely on office hours or discussion section to explain the material.","neu"
97981,"I would recommend this course but you must go to the discussion sections to aid your learning.","r"
97981,"I would recommend this class to students looking to engage with computer science without being in an environment they're totally unfamiliar with--most of your peers in this class are humanities and social science majors, meaning everyone is coming in with similar levels of experience and interest.","r"
97981,"Yes, great intro to python and data science","r"
97981,"Yes, this course provided exactly what I was looking for. It was an introduction to python programming for people that will not become computer scientists. It was accessible, accommodating, and beginner friendly. The course felt approachable but also left me with a satisfactory level of programming skills.","r"
97981,"I recommend this course to students who are interested in Python and data analytics, especially who are budgeting 10+ hours a week joining TA sessions and doing homework.","r"
97981,"Yes! This is a very well-organized course that makes computer programming and python very accessible for those coming from non-STEM backgrounds. You learn an extremely large amount of content in the span of a semester.","r"
97981,"Absolutely not unless you have programming experience. This was the worst class I have taken at Yale.","dr"
97981,"If you're interested in this topic and/or need a QR credit, my opinion is that you should just take a statistics class or YData. I feel like this class has the potential to become really great if changed to a seminar format, but in it's current state I felt pretty disappointed by the strange organization of the class, and the fact that I felt like I never really learned how to code.","neu"
97981,"If you want to learn python, yes!!! It is a great way to learn python at Yale. The class isn't intimidating and is filled with non-stem majors, and the professor knows that. I would highly recommend it as an introduction to python, so long as you are willing to put in the work especially at the beginning of the semester. It's a steep learning curve until after the first midterm, but the second half of the semester is super chill.","r"
97981,"If you are looking for an easier QR as a humanities major, do NOT take this unless you have the ability to spend hours outside of lecture-- 4-5 hours at office hours and perhaps 2 more to understand the material-- on PSETs and other material in order to overcome the high learning curve. Although there are many opportunities and resources to pass, it was a class that required you to prioritize almost every week. If you are willing to also put some of your other class materials on the backburner then take it. Personally, I was on the cusp of CR/D/F-ing the class until the very last minute, so if this is to fulfill the QR credit then I don't suggest it. Also as of now, there is NO CURVE for the class.","dr"
97981,"Yes, as it's probably the easiest beginning class for computer science at Yale, nonetheless, still difficult, so only if you actually want to learn how to code.","r"
97981,"yes it is a good QR for non-stem people in which you actually learn something about computer science and python. big caveat is that it is hard this is not an easy QR if thats what you're looking for. you cannot do well in this class unless you go to office hours and discussion sections A LOT","r"
97981,"Yes! Python is such a useful skill and Professor Park is the most kind woman ever.","r"
97981,"If you are a non-CS major looking for an approachable class to start learning some CS, this is definitely the one. Manageable but you learn a lot.","r"
97981,"No if you don't have the time in your schedule to give this class all of your time.","dr"
97981,"absolutely not. this course pretends to be intro CS for humanities majors but it moves way too fast for it to be tailored to someone with 0 coding experience. I was constantly behind in this class and while I learned some skills that might end up being valuable the stress and workload was not worth it for me.","dr"
97981,"Yes, this class has very interesting content and great student engagement","r"
97981,"Yes! For anyone who wants a general understanding of Python and data, while this isn't an easy course, it's very supportive and fun and a good place to start for those who have the time and energy to fully invest in learning it all in just one semester.","r"
97981,"Kind of. The subject was interesting and its a QR. but I do not think it was actually curated to humanities majors, and the pace is much to fast for people who arent used to quantitive analysis.","neu"
97981,"If you are interested in becoming comfortable with basic Python programming, yes!! Also, you have the opportunity to develop a cool data science project. Additionally, this course does not have the same crazy workload as CS50/CPSC100, which makes it way better if you are more of a slow learner like me lol","r"
97981,"Do not take this course if you're looking for a very basic coding class geared toward Humanities / Social Science students.","dr"
97981,"Probably not. Personally I disliked it, but this is probably as much a function of my own disposition as anything inherent in the class.   For the first few weeks I quite enjoyed learning about and solving problems with Python - it was a new way of thinking and writing that was often interesting. But when we started the data science unit, I completely checked out. Everything about it was obscure and absurd to me. Perhaps someone with a better understanding of the underlying math can see the value in the kind of analysis we conducted (though I have my doubts even about that), but for the level of understanding that students in the class had (this is a course oriented for students in the humanities/social sciences, remember), it just seemed a bunch of utterly pointless hand waving. The final project in particular was one of the most excruciating experiences of my academic life, and singlehandedly made me swear off any kind of data science class at any point in the future.  That being said, getting a good grade in this class is pretty doable. Of course, if a grade is what you're after, there are better classes for you (THIS IS NOT A GUT, HOWEVER THE COURSE NAME MIGHT MAKE IT SOUND), so you should only take it if you think the contents will interest you. And that's a question you should consider carefully.","dr"
97981,"I would probably recommend an entry level stats class rather than this one.","dr"
97981,"Yes","r"
97981,"If you are able to grasp concepts quickly and have an interest in computer science as a humanities or social sciences student, I would recommend this course. However, if you find that you need more time to understand material and don't have the time to prepare before lectures to be able to keep up, I would not recommend this course. Moreover, unless you have the time to go to office hours and/or discussion section, this class can very easily make you feel like you're drowning in work and far behind.","neu"
97983,"It's a fine class, but take CS50 instead.","dr"
97983,"Yes, if they want to learn computer science but have no background.","r"
97983,"YES! I seriously think more people at Yale should be taking Computer Science. It gets a bad reputation but it is such a valuable skill set for anyone. I think the course does a great job at having examples that relate to the arts / non-STEM areas which is really great to see. I wish more people took this course!  Do not be intimidated by the workload or what others say. As an upperclassmen in this course (lol), I think the high workload rating is because first-years (who are the majority of course participants) are not used to more rigorous courses where going to office hours / section is really helpful and almost necessary. I have definitely taken courses that are much more difficult with more work in non STEM departments. I also found the work to generally be very interesting -- CS is just problem solving!","r"
97983,"Yes -- it's somewhat required for the major but it's also just a really helpful class. I'd take this and CS50 if you have the time/energy","r"
97983,"I would not recommend. I think depending on your experience level the problem sets can take a tremendous amount of time and the resources available for the class are not structured in a good manner so it can be difficult to learn more about a concept you are struggling with.","dr"
97983,"I would recommend it if you have no other classes that will need a lot of attention. I went to office hours about 14 hrs every week, and still worked on my psets outside of that time. Only take this class if you feel you're able to apply new concepts very easily and quickly.","r"
97983,"Yes I would. I enjoyed the problem sets and feel like I have gained a valuable skillset that I will take with me.","r"
97983,"I absolutely would recommend -- it was a lot of fun, and I think understanding how programming works is good knowledge to have regardless of where your career path takes you. Taking this course, though, has definitely made me seriously consider going into some sort of computing-related major.","r"
97983,"Absolutely! It's not very difficult and it's so important to know how to program in today's world. This is probably the most useful class I have taken at Yale thus far.","r"
97983,"I'm not sure if I would entirely recommend it. Some people find the class easy but I found it unnecessarily difficult. Maybe if this is their only tough class.","dr"
97983,"Never in a million years. Stay away from this class. Trust me.","dr"
97983,"Yes, if the student is interested in programming or a potential major in computer science. It introduces a lot of great concepts that can be applied in other fields but the real goal is to turn you into a programmer. If you don't think you'd want to use programming in your life or be a computer science major, it might be better to take a different programming course tailored to another discipline (e.g. programming for engineers, arts, etc.)","r"
97983,"Yes! I came into this course with no coding experience whatsoever, and I'm leaving this course with an excellent understanding of how to build programs with confidence. The prof, course manager, and ULAs were always encouraging. The psets always had an interesting focus across disciplines (music, natural language processing, animation, etc) which made them more fun to complete given how many hours you put into them. The workload of this class may seem scary, but by starting psets EARLY and going to office hours OFTEN, you can minimize the stress and actually enjoy this class! If you put your best effort into psets, the rest of the class (midterm, final projects, attendance) will be smooth. The final project gives you a great opportunity to be creative and explore CS more.","r"
97983,"Genuinely, no. This course is not worth it and is very poorly taught compared to other courses at Yale. I'm not even saying this because I got a bad grade. It just genuinely was not a good course. Please learn computer science in any other way. The PSET's will take you way too long and you will not be prepared by the lectures to complete them. You will basically be teaching yourself how to do a lot of stuff, so you may as well teach yourself in a lower-stakes environment. If I did not have a natural inclination for science-y stuff I do not know how I would have done this course.","dr"
97983,"Yes, its better than cpsc100.","r"
97983,"No, bad introduction for little payoff. Would recommend higher level or not doing computer science at yale","dr"
97983,"I would recommend this course to anyone interested in programming or getting a start in computer science.","r"
97983,"Don't take it for a QR--way too much work--but take it if you want to learn basic computer science. The way of thinking is more useful than the actual language/syntax, and I feel like I grasp both now.","neu"
97983,"I would recommend it if they were looking for a challenging introduction to CS, but would likely not recommend it as a supplemental class to take for fun.","neu"
97983,"Someone in CS or that wants to learn Java","neu"
97983,"I thought this course was fantastic, but only if you are really able to commit to spending lots of time on the problem sets. They are very rewarding, but I think would be quite unenjoyable and overwhelming if one was not ready to devote many hours a week to them. If you make this class a priority, it is a great and interesting way to learn how to code. I came in with minimal coding experience, and by the end of the class I was able to code an entire game from start to finish in Java.","r"
97983,"yes if you are interested in learning code somewhat.","r"
97988,"I enjoyed it for a QR!","r"
97988,"Yes. Good way to tell if you're interested in data science, and even if you end up not liking data science, you'll come out of the course with plenty of useful skills for whatever your field is.","r"
97988,"I think it offers a decent intro to coding in python, but it's a bit convoluted with trying to do both the Python and the stats. The stats at the end especially felt pretty rushed. I would recommend if you've already taken statistics / if you have a decent background","r"
97988,"I would recommend this course to anyone who's looking to learn Python under a specific context. However, if you don't have a strong background in data science and statistics, there are probably other courses that better teach you these concepts.","neu"
97988,"Yes, but only if they are very self-disciplined. A lot of the learning happens outside of the classroom, and students need to be willing to commit to that.","r"
97988,"I would only recommend to someone who has zero programming and stats experience. If you have some programming background and would only take this class to learn python (that was me), I wouldn't do it. It is not very interesting and you could probably learn python through online websites/courses quicker.","r"
97988,"Yes, if you want to learn python at a relatively easy pace but are scared of heavy CS courses this is the way to go.","r"
97988,"If you want an intro to python, this is a great course to get started!","r"
97988,"Yes. Very helpful","r"
97988,"I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn the basics of Python.","r"
97988,"Yes. I was worried about taking a coding class for the first time, even though the course says it was designed for beginners, because Yale courses rarely are. However, this course is actually true to that. It does a very good job of getting everyone up to speed, even if you've never coded before. I think it is a great opportunity to get more familiar with these skills in a relatively low-pressure environment, and with very interesting applications.","r"
97988,"Yes! The professor is excellent and I learned a lot of useful and interesting coding techniques from the course.","r"
97988,"I would recommend this course for what it is, an introduction to Python. The class prioritized practicing the code to ensure that all students had time to actually work through what was being taught in real time, not just on psets after class. The work load is not too stressful and the knowledge I have now is much more than I came in with.","r"
97988,"Yes, if you want a basic learning of pandas, seaborn, so on. But honestly the course was kind of wack in my opinion, especially because of the exams. The material that is on the exams, though covers the same topics as the psets, was just brought up in an entirely different way that made everything seem extremely overcomplicated.","r"
97988,"Sure","r"
97988,"Yes","r"
97988,"Yes, good way to learn coding in python and data science.","r"
97988,"yes","r"
97988,"I think it is a good intro stats and intro coding class","r"
97988,"No. Do not take this class. The prof's voice is kind of annoying (not a deal breaker, but something to consider) and the class is difficult for people who have not coded before. The exams are handwritten, which is very difficult because you do not get to run your code and figure out if you have any errors.","dr"
97988,"yes, it is a great introduction to data science and coding in Python and is a pretty manageable courses, although you will definitely need to prepare for the exams.","r"
97988,"Yes! If you're interested in data science it's a great introductory course.","r"
97988,"If you are interested in learning python, this is a good class to facilitate that.","r"
97988,"I would because it taught me a lot of useful skills that I could see myself using in further classes or in a career. It wasn't very difficult on a week-to-week basis.","r"
97988,"Yes, I learned a lot from this course and think it is a very cool class to take if you are even remotely considering S&DS major or certificate.","r"
97988,"Yes!","r"
97988,"If you are interested in having a python background to approach data analysis then yes. But if you are more interested in data that applies to other fields then no.","neu"
97988,"Yes definitely","r"
97988,"Yes I would - it is very clearly taught.","r"
97988,"Great class","r"
97988,"Yes, I would. This is a good course for someone who wants to take an advanced statistics class or someone who wants to get a base knowledge of coding without having to take CS50. This course was great for someone with absolutely no knowledge of coding like me.","r"
97988,"Yes, if you are interested in an interesting but manageable QR credit or in picking up coding for the first time.","r"
97988,"Bravo","r"
97988,"If you are a social science major looking for a QR or background in data science, yes. It's a great class to teach you skills you might need in final papers. I realized that Python could have made my final project for a Political Science class in the previous semester much easieryou can do things in 5 minutes on Python that would take 30 on Excel. There is a difference between Statistics and Data Science, so make sure to choose the one that you are looking for.","r"
97988,"Yes, with the caveat that I slacked off more than I should've. That's on me; if you pay attention and do the work you'll do fine.","r"
97988,"Yes and no. If you have background with coding then yes, this class is pretty fun to learn about the various ways you can use python. The professor explains things vaguely and sometimes it is difficult to understand the material.","neu"
97988,"Yes, very insightful in terms of programming applications","r"
97988,"If wanting to get into cs and if required, yes.","r"
97988,"If you want to learn to use Python to visualize data then sure, although these skills could likely be picked up through self-study. The exams are somewhat hard and the project can be time-consuming, so don't think of it as an easy 5th. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have a specific desire to gain this skillset. Also, the class moves really fast through background of coding in Python, so some prior coding experience would be helpful.","neu"
97988,"I would recommend this class to a student if they are looking for a relatively straightforward QR credit, or if it is required for their major. At times the course can be difficult but generally, the grading is lenient and the TAs are great with students","r"
97988,"Yes- great class","r"
97988,"For a student new to programming and who wishes to also dip into basic statistics principles, this course is a perfect fit.","r"
97988,"Maybe if strong interest in the content","neu"
97988,"Yes, it's a good intro to Python but keep up with the work.","r"
97988,"Not if you dont already have coding experience","dr"
97988,"I would not recommend this course to other students. I think it needs to be significantly better organized and the syllabus should be restructured to make for a better experience for students of all backgrounds in CS/S&DS.","dr"
97988,"Yes, if you have never coded before and are interested in it.","r"
97988,"I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in stats","r"
97988,"For neuroscience majors looking to fulfill the computational requirement, I feel like this is a far better course than CS50. If that doesnt apply to you, then this is a great course to take credit/D. Regardless, you definitely learn a lot of practical coding skills!","r"
97988,"If you are interested in developing skills with one of the most important coding languages practiced today, I highly recommend this course.","r"
97988,"Yes. This is a great entry to python course.","r"
97988,"Yes, I would. It made learning Python more accessible for those who, like myself, had little to no prior coding experience.","r"
97988,"Yes, it is important to know basics of coding","r"
97988,"yes for people who are trying to get basic understanding of python computing","r"
97988,"only if you have to for your major","neu"
97988,"Yes! If you are looking for an intro to python that has a focus, this is it. This course felt like primarily an intro to python, as only a few lectures were actually about statistics and thus ""data science"" but there was always a sense that it was going to be used for a particular purpose, and then when it came time for the final project, the application of the code to data science was clearer. Therefore, this course will not give a very in-depth perspective on data science and statistics, but it will provide you with the skills to begin using python to organize and present data in an informative and productive manner.","r"
97988,"I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning more about Statistics and Data Science. I think that this is a good introductory course, and is also accesible to those who are not as engaged in data science.","r"
97988,"I would recommend this course because as a STEM major, being able to analyze data in an efficient manor is very helpful. I think this applies for many other career paths as well.","r"
97988,"Absolutely! Great course, where you start simple but quickly move on to interesting topics and techniques. This course made me interested in further studying and learning data science and participating in Kaggle competitions.","r"
97988,"Its a solid qr and its helpful to learn the basics of python. I ended up credit/ding the class and it became very chill and very helpful for learning a lot, but I think if I still took it for a grade I wouldve been way more stressed about the class. If you want a peek into how to code I would recommend the class, but give yourself the option to credit d it if you are brand new at coding.","r"
97988,"yes, it is applicable to all majors and can be insightful on the intersection between technology and humanities.","r"
97988,"Yes. It teaches you basic skills in python","r"
97991,"Yes - recursion is SO fundamental in programming!","r"
97991,"Yes, I believe this course is fundamental to any students learning.","r"
97991,"Yes. This course is great if you want to learn about recursion and if you want to get started in Computer Science and Yale.","r"
97991,"Yes. I think you learn a lot of interesting things and it would be fun even if one wasnt a computer science major","r"
97991,"Yes. This course is my favorite course this semester. I think it is underrated. It is definitely a worth-taking course if finding a job in Google ASAP is not your only priority in life. It is more worth-taking if you are a beginner in cs who wants to develop a passion or a curiosity to further your pursuit. Slade is an amazing educator.","r"
97991,"I would only really recommend this course if you needed it for the major or for the certificate. I do think the content can be interesting like at times but the class is way too theoretical for a CS class if you're not interesting in the major or the certificate.","neu"
97991,"Yes, it is a great intro course","r"
97991,"Yes! I learned that I really like computer science, not just programming. Racket is weird, but not terrible, and recursion is fun. You'll learn a lot in this class, at the very least whether or not you want to take more CS.","r"
97991,"Yes. This was the first CS class I had ever taken and the ULAs were really accessible and helpful. Don't fall behind.","r"
97991,"Maybe, I don't regret taking it because it definitely gave me a stronger foundation with which to succeed in 223, but the argument of just skipping 201 and going straight to 223 is still valid","neu"
97991,"I would recommend this course to anyone in the CS major, or to anyone who wants a niche understanding of computer systems. It is a bit too niche to be generally recommended to anyone interested in CS though.","r"
97991,"Not if they didn't need it for a major","dr"
97991,"Yeah I do but not strongly. Skip it if you can.","r"
97991,"Yes for anyone looking to get a good introduction to computer science.","r"
97991,"Yes, if they are a beginner coder and want to understand more foundational computer and coding concepts. Professor Slade is also very kind and wants you to succeed. He gives a generous curve and emphasizes that this is not a weeder class. However, most of the things we learn, given that Racket is not widely used, are not very useful for industry careers. If you have more coding experience then skip this class.","r"
97991,"Not unless required or you are really interested in the more theoretical side of CS. I took this to fulfill a requirement for the Cognitive Science major and I personally thought the topics were kind of meh except for the strings pset which I really enjoyed. Exams are very fair, but the hand-writing code takes some getting used to. Slade is a nice, funny guy but not an engaging lecturer. Definitely a huge downgrade from CS50.","dr"
97991,"I think this is a great class for students who plan to pursue more computer classes in the future. The content is not very applicable to students who are not very interested in computer science, and for that reason, a more programming oriented course would be more suited for them. Otherwise, this course introduces many topics that are important to the field of computer science and are built on in later courses.","r"
97991,"Yes if they are interested in theory.","r"
97991,"Yes very useful skills","r"
97991,"If you want to learn recursion from the basics and are curious about the workings of computers, its a good introduction course. Itll take time to get used to racket but once you get comfortable, it gets far better.","r"
97991,"Only if u have to take it","neu"
97991,"I surprisingly really like this course. The course work, grading, and exams were fair. While the professor was a little dry at times, I enjoyed the actual content we were learning about.","r"
97991,"Only if you need it; there are many other CS courses that will give a better overview/introduction","neu"
97991,"No, only if required for major.","dr"
97991,"Yes! If you know how to manage your time, youll do extremely well in the class. Also, Professor Slade is an amazing teacher who really cares about his students. Youll learn a lot and be in a very cool environment in doing so.","r"
97991,"If you are interested in majoring in Computer Science, take the course.","r"
97991,"Yes, really changed how I understand computation.","r"
97991,"No. Skip it, even if you have limited programming experience.","dr"
97991,"Yes, if you haven't done much programming and want a solid base to continue with programming.","r"
97991,"Yes I would, it is a very interesting course.","r"
97991,"No you learn superficially","dr"
97991,"No.","dr"
97991,"yes, I believe this class helped me understand recursion and other topics that should help me with other classes.","r"
97991,"I think I would. It's tough, but you'll learn a lot if you aren't familiar with CS already. That being said, I don't know how practical some of the topics are and how much you really need to know them in the future.","neu"
97991,"I would only recommend it if you have taken CS50 or another introductory CS class. If this is your first CS class, even if you are capable of doing math/science/other QR courses, it is rather difficult to keep up, and will end up consuming far more time than you are willing to give. Even if you are experienced in QR, CS201 as a first CS class will end up making you sacrifice more than you want.","neu"
97991,"Yes! It really made me think and improved my logical skills.","r"
97991,"I would recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot in this course, and the course was very doable (even for someone like me, who hadn't previous taken a CS course at Yale) and was designed to facilitate our learning.","r"
97991,"yes","r"
97991,"Yes, if they want to learn about recursion, computer architecture, and Boolean expressions.","r"
97991,"Yes! It is a great way to get into the field of CS and it demonstrates the wide range of possibilities.","r"
97991,"Not particularly. Just soooo much work for concepts that you could easily practice on your own and a lot of specialized language for just CS201. However, the course is a great opportunity to hone in recursion skills and learn basic science of computers if you dont have an ability to learn it yourself, or typically learn.","dr"
97991,"Yes if they are interested in computer science","r"
97991,"Yes if youre interested in computers","r"
97991,"I actually liked 201 as someone who has taken APCSA and APCS Principles. The course does cover some concepts you likely will never use again, but the experience you get sitting with concepts and problem-solving/troubleshooting is good practice in my opinion. It will get frustrating sometimes, but it is rewarding in the end if you keep trying. It did give me a very strong foundation in coding recursion and learning a completely new language. Racket is really not all that bad. The TAs are a little hit-or-miss, but go to office hours anyways if you are struggling. You will find a good one eventually. Or make 201 friends! As for the lectures, they are long and boring, no lie. But sometimes they are worth watching on 2x.","r"
97991,"Yes, cause it opens your mind to different ways of writing computer programs to address the same issue","r"
97991,"Only if you are pursuing the CS major or certificate or have a strong dual interest in CS unless you have an extensive background in CS, there is some benefit to taking this before 223 and 323. Dont take this course just for fun or to try out CS though, there are better courses for that! Lectures are entertaining but not necessarily that helpful for your learning, but the course material was interesting. Some people spent 20-25+ hours on later p-sets, so be prepared to be devote time to this course. Midterms werent too difficult if you know what to expect; the final was more challenging.","neu"
97991,"Yes, if you're a CS major or deeply interested in the theoretical components of computer science. If do not have to take it or are not naturally drawn to computation, there are better courses to take.","r"
97991,"I would only recommend this course to another student if they are planning to declare the Computer Science major! If you want to learn programming, I would reccomend taking CSPC 100 (aka CS 50), CSPC 112, or CSPC 110 instead. This is not a class that teaches you about programming (even though we do learn Racket), but more so core concepts in computer science theory (such as the runtime of programs). However, half of students in this class do get grades of A and A!","neu"
97991,"If you are a computer science student who wants to learn more about computer science, then yes! This class wasn't my absolute favorite, but I enjoyed it! I think you do need to have some coding/programming experience before taking 201, or else you would feel very lost. The course is very manageable and I did learn some applicable skills to improve as a cs student (recursion!). I debated moving straight to 223 instead of 201, and I'm glad I took 201 to learn some of these more basic elements of programming before moving to 223.","r"
97991,"If you are doing Computer Science, I would recommend taking this course for obvious reasons. Otherwise, I really would not recommend doing this course if you only have passing interest in Computer Science or want to take an intro CPSC course. What it teaches is helpful for computer science majors only for the most part.","neu"
97991,"Yes. Take this course because it teaches you a lot about the fundamentals of computer science.","r"
97992,"I would not recommend this course to another student due to its boring and repetitive nature. I do not agree that it should be a requirement for the CS BS/BA degree because it forces students to take a repetitive class that covers material they already know.","dr"
97992,"No. It might be better to take the Discrete Math for Math majors course instead.","dr"
97992,"Yes, especially if they want to get a solid introduction to discrete math and proofs.","r"
97992,"I would recommend this course to any CPSC majors looking to fulfill the discrete mathematics requirement for the CPSC major. While challenging, this course is both more relevant to CS and more manageable than MATH 244, the only other option. I would not necessarily recommend this course to those interested in the CPSC certificate, as this course is not directly required for the certificate (only as a prerequisite for some certificate electives). It is not a course that you want to take on a whim, and is only really relevant to those studying CPSC at the major (or possibly certificate) level.","r"
97992,"Yes. Its required for the CS major, but its a fun class even for non majors like me. It contains a good introduction to proofs. I dont recommend if you care about grades..","r"
97992,"Yes, it is useful to understand discrete math.","r"
97992,"I believe it is a useful course if you want to take more CS courses in the future, although you should probably not take it with Glenn.","neu"
97992,"Yes, I felt like this was a good introduction to proof-based math.","r"
97992,"Yes. I think it was a really interesting but challenging course to take.","r"
97992,"Not really. It needs to be a bit easier, Glenn is not an easy professor. If we are putting in this much work you should just take Math 240.","dr"
97992,"No, at least not with Prof Glenn. Although I enjoyed learning discrete math and Glenn is great at cracking jokes in class, the second half of the semester was extremely more difficult, lectures did not thoroughly explain concepts that were included on psets, and there was a lack of support for students. Many of my peers withdrew from this class. Discrete math is an incredibly interesting topic, but I would recommend taking it with a different professor.","dr"
97992,"I absolutely would not. Take this course with anyone but James Glenn and maybe it will be okay.","dr"
97992,"I would only recommend this course to a student who was extremely interested in learning more about discrete math from a computer science angle. The class was quite difficult at times and it doesn't feel like there is enough support. Certain concepts did not ""click"" for me; especially when writing proofs, certain steps were simply not intuitive.","neu"
97992,"Yes. It is a great class if you want to learn more about discrete math.","r"
97992,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think this course was an outstanding introduction to proof writing, and it was very much manageable. I think the course is definitely more fun with Dr. Glenn teaching as the lectures were very engaging. The course material itself is actually pretty interesting. There are great resources to get help when you do not know what is going on with the course material. I learned a lot, and the grading was fair. This was an outstanding course.","r"
97992,"i would","r"
97992,"If you're a CS major, you just have to take it, so it's not really about recommending. Just don't take it with Glenn.","neu"
97992,"It depends on who's teaching it. This semester, 25% of the class scored a D- or worse in the final exam. 50% scored a C- or worse. And at least ~15 of the points in the final were simple Yes/No questions. This is not supposed to be a difficult course; it's meant to be the easier counterpart to MATH 244. Yet, I wish I had taken MATH 244.","neu"
97992,"I would recommend if it is a prerequisite for another class you're interested in or if you're pursuing CS.","r"
97992,"Only if you need it for your major. If you're looking for a discrete math class, I think just taking discrete math is a better bet.","neu"
97992,"Not really, but no one is taking this if they don't have to. I would maybe recommend with a different professor though.","dr"
97992,"not unless it is required by your major. try to take it with a professor other than glenn.","dr"
97992,"Later psets in particular were quite difficult, but at least psets constituted 50% of the grade. Material was interesting, although we spent a significant portion of the first half of the course on logic, and I would probably recommend this over discrete math (244) if you are a CS major and want to see the applicability of course topics to CS.","neu"
97992,"Absolutely. Obviously it's necessary for the CS major, but it's interesting and Prof. Glenn explains mathematical concepts in a way that makes them feel intuitive.","r"
97992,"I would definitely recommend this course to others in the CS major that need to meet the discrete math requirement.","r"
97992,"If you are a CS major, then yes","r"
97992,"This was the first time Prof Glenn taught this course, and as his notorious reputation goes, it was much harder than the previous years. The psets took longer to solve and the exams were much tougher than expected. What was worst, though, was the fact that most psets were not corrected before the midterm and final exams leaving us in the dark to our mistakes and the ways to prove the questions. However, besides the poor organization, the course definitely teaches you how to write mathematical proofs. Do not take it with Prof Glenn unless you have to, which I dont think should ever happen.","dr"
97992,"It is essential if you want to be a computer science major, but overall good if you just want to develop basic understanding of the logic of computer science and structures behind that","r"
97992,"Look, it's a core requirement for the CS major, so ""recommend"" is a useless question. Instead, 'll answer the question ""would I recommend it over 244"", without having taken 244. I think the class offers a good enough introduction to most of the math you'll need, but to be honest, I can see why you might want to take 244. The class does lack *some* of the rigour needed in high-level classes, and misses some of the linear algebra needed in high level classes (though that would be covered in 225, not 244). But, for most students, the rigour is simply not needed - unless you plan on going to grad school, I don't think taking 244 is necessary. Also, if you like math, 244 might be a better fit for you.","neu"
97992,"Absolutely not with this professor","dr"
97992,"Yup, because u have to take if if you are a CS major, and the content ftom the class helped me start thinking more like a CS major!","r"
97992,"No, only take it if you need to, or just don't take it with Glenn. It should've been a straight forward class, but Glenn made exams much to difficult, and included material and proof strategies in the psets that were never discussed in class.","dr"
97992,"Yes. It is helpful, especially for understanding things like runtime and counting.","r"
97992,"I wouldn't really recommend this course unless you have an interest or need it for a major. The class isn't very interesting and doesn't really provide anything unless it has something to do with your major like CS or Math.","dr"
97992,"If its required for their major","neu"
97992,"No, but it's a requirement of the CS major. Each topic just feels very insular","dr"
97992,"I would recommend taking this course under the professor that taught it previously. According to the students that had taken it a semester prior, the class was much more organized and expectations were managed well.","neu"
97992,"No, not really. It was not a fun course, not sure how useful it was. It's a crash course on functions, proofs, statistics, and linear algebra that I didn't learn well. I almost want the CS department just to mandate us to take a stat or lin algebra course(s) instead as it would be more specialized in the math department with more tutoring resources and concepts taught more in-depth. I know I could have taken Math 244 but their syllabus is also similar in the ways many forms of discrete math are taught, in my understanding.","dr"
97992,"Yes, primarily students majoring or interested in CS and math","r"
97993,"If you have to take it for your major, then don't really dread it. Even if you're not CS or CS/something, the content is very interesting and is worth learning. Talk to people that have taken the course more recently and ask them how they feel about it. Ozan has potential. Do not take this class if Weide is co-teaching.","neu"
97993,"I would wait a couple of semesters before taking this course, so that it is better organized.","neu"
97993,"Yes, fun class with useful CS concepts.","r"
97993,"I would recommend this course to anyone -- both CS and non-CS majors. I think it is great for deepening your CS knowledge, and I think that the new professors are trying to make it super accessible. There is also a lot of support built-in to the course.","r"
97993,"Yes, especially since despite the newness of instructors/rather rough start to the semester organizationally, the improvement in instruction/organization quality has been dramatic.","r"
97993,"Yes, since it is a requirement for the CS major","r"
97993,"I'm assuming you're taking this course because it's required. If that's not the case, I wouldn't recommend it. However, for those who require 223, I would generally recommend taking it with Alan and Ozan, at least over the alternative. This semester was pretty rough, but I'm confident they'll improve it in the future.","dr"
97993,"Yes, it is helpful to understand data structures.","r"
97993,"Yes - the Professors try to make this course very accessible to newer programmers and not just a class as a prerequisite. A good way to get practice on a field that might become part of the ""Core Curriculum"" in the future.","r"
97993,"YES!!! This course is extremely useful, especially for tech interviews. I completed a tech interview for a software dev internship (which I got!) while relying heavily on the material I learned in this course. I would recommend 223 to anyone who potentially wants to go into tech after graduation.","r"
97993,"If you're a cs major you kinda have to, it's like death and taxes. However, if you're S&DS or anything other than cs but want to learn data structures, you're better off learning online. This course was extremely disorganized, but I don't really blame the professors since it's their first time running it. PSETS were made on the fly, and test cases were released either late or broken. PSETS almost always have bugs that instructor needs to fix. By the last two psets, instructors didnt even release test cases, covering up with ""well a good programmer should be able to think of their own test cases."" Exams are hard, no curve.","neu"
97993,"Would not recommend the class in its current form. Super disorganized. Did not learn all that much. There are definitely better resources online to learn all the same material without the headache.  Nevertheless, you kinda have to take the class if you're a CS major, so best of luck.","dr"
97993,"Not if the same professors are teaching and they haven't gotten better Feel like I didn't get much out of it even though it was my first comp sci class at Yale","dr"
97993,"If it's not a requirement than no, but if you have to take it then it's fine.","dr"
97993,"I can tell the class is going in a good direction compared to previous years, and I think there is a lot to gain out of this class, so yes.","r"
97993,"Yes, eventually you'd need to take it to do serious computer science.","r"
97993,"Yes, I would just tell them that the instructions can be a bit unclear at times, that there are a lot of moving, unfinished aspects of the class.","r"
97993,"In theory yes; data structures are integral to your future development of CS skills and maturity. However, this course was very poorly organized and left out much potential in learning, etc. I would not recommend the professors. Although Ozan was very enthusiastic, it just seemed like the class was not ready to be taught (frequent pset errors, exam questions improperly made, constantly changing schedule, etc.).","neu"
97993,"For CS majors, you have to. For non-CS majors, I'd recommend taking it after Alan/Ozan have had more teaching experience.","neu"
97993,"I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. I've described many of the strengths of this course, which mean that students most definitely will learn a lot. I wholeheartedly have faith in the instructors' ability to patch up the current weaknesses of the course, so those will probably be non-issues in future iterations of the course. Although future students must take care due to the high workload, I believe that they will learn a lot, and that many of the major weaknesses of this iteration will not be present in the future.","r"
97993,"I would, if it could be structured better. It was difficult to get assistance at office hours and the class was hard to navigate through due to the many structural issues with it.","r"
97993,"I mean you gotta for CS but i did not learn much and i dont feel prepared for 323","dr"
97993,"Yes, the course is very important for CS science, and I am sure after this year it will be more organized and students will better learn the material","r"
97993,"In its current format, I would only recommend this course if it is required for your major.","neu"
97993,"Yea. They were first time prof's so it will probably get better. I had a really good time.","r"
97993,"I would recommend it for the content; however, if you take it, take it with a different instructor.","r"
97993,"Not really, but if it's a requirement you have to take it. It wasn't well organized.","dr"
97993,"Take it if you have to, but most of the assignments were fun","neu"
97993,"I would. I was my first actual CS class, and with literally 0 background in data structures, I found it pretty insightful. People collectively complained a lot, and it sometimes felt hopeless and lacking in support, but overall, with good planning and readiness to actively reach out for help, the course can be enjoyable and not even that much stressful.","r"
97993,"If you have to take it, then sure. It wasn't terrible and I'm optimistic that it will be better in the coming iterations; this was the first time the course had C++ and the transition was pretty bumpy. I really appreciate their efforts to change it and I think it will definitely be a lot more worth taking in the future.","r"
97993,"i would once the course gets more organized","r"
97993,"Yes, it is a fundamental class in CS","r"
97993,"Yes, I would. It is imperative for upper level CS courses.","r"
97993,"I would recommend this class to all students looking to improve in their theoretical and practical understanding of computer science. This course will likely be very helpful in terms of real world applications as well.","r"
97993,"I would recommend this course especially to someone who has had hands-on experience with C or C++ before. I don't think I would recommend jumping straight in without taking any of the previous CS courses, like I did.","r"
97993,"Yea Id recommend, I was able to take away an understanding of data structures, memory management, and ability to write complex programs","r"
97993,"I would not recommend this course to anyone. I understand the content is very important, however, and I hope that it is significantly fixed so that students can actually learn the content.","dr"
97993,"Yes, pretty essential for CS majors.","r"
97993,"Nope. This is just about the worst course I have ever taken. It should be avoided unless required for your major","dr"
97993,"Yes, this course teaches c++ and the intricacies of different data structures, both of which are interesting and important topics. The class has recently gone through many changes, so I imagine the course will continue to change as it settles into its new form. Both the professors really care a lot about the students and were very understanding of everything.","r"
97993,"Yes if they are a cs major and need to get the requirements out of the way.","r"
97993,"Yes, if that person wants to learn data structures and is a complete beginner","r"
97993,"I would not recommend this course to another student if it were taught by the same instructors. This class does not prepare all students for a good foundation in DSA because of its lack of organization - it is a strong barrier for those who cannot afford to get past the disorganization and confusion since they have relatively less experience with programming.","dr"
97993,"No, even though I think this is important to understand for anyone who is computer science adjacent.","dr"
97993,"yes, if they have to or they enjoy learning c and/or c++","r"
97993,"Yes, because I like the content and over the course of this course I saw that the issues that occurred were fixed (at least to some degree). For example, they fixed how weird the midterm was. They also fixed the organization (still needs a bit of improvement, it became exponentially better).","r"
97993,"yes, good for learning data structures in programming","r"
97993,"No, if you don't need it for the major. It will be a great cause of stress. Extremely disorganized. Though, you can tell the professors care, it did not come through in the organization of the class nor lectures.","dr"
97993,"I would recommend it simply because the content is super interesting and it helps you get more coding reps in. But try to take it with friends. Hopefully, Ozan and Alan will make it more organized for next time but in general their lectures are a disaster.","r"
97993,"Necessary for cs","neu"
97993,"Well if you gotta take it, you gotta take it. But if not, take some other class in CS.","neu"
97993,"I do not recommend taking this class with Alan Weide and Ozan Erat. Hopefully, the professors that taught this class in the previous years will teach it again, but this was the most disorganized course I have ever taken at Yale. It was the first time that both professors were teaching this class and they also wanted to change the curriculum to add C++. Initially, I was excited about the idea, but even before entering the C++ part of the content, the class started to become a mess. Since Ed Discussion participation was rewarded with bonus points, several posts a day with repeated information were made, especially near problem-set deadlines. Not only that, but it seemed like most problem sets were not properly reviewed by the professors, given that some of them had multiple announcements with changes and updates. For example, one of the psets stated that we should not use dynamically allocated memory when that was the only way to solve it. Professor Erat later sent an announcement correcting it and provided bonus points for students that did the pset using both dynamic and static memory. Furthermore, one of the codes provided in the *exam* gave segmentation fault, showing that they could have done a better job reviewing the exam before giving it to the entire class.  Compared to students that took the class in previous semesters, I noticed how much more they learned and how much more they were satisfied with the class. I strongly encourage students to wait until someone else is teaching it. I also believe that the Computer Science department should do something about this core cs class. CS223 represents one of the main classes for the department and it was turned into a mess. One of the best things about this course was the ULAs. Many people went to their office hours for assistance and from my experience, they were incredibly helpful. I also wanted to give a huge shoutout to Ben Goldstein. My experience with the course would have been so much worse if it was not for him. Ben held a walkthrough for each problem set and exam review sessions, which were essential for me to better comprehend the contents of the class.","dr"
97993,"it's required for CS majors, and a pretty big part in coding interviews so yeah. But to anyone that is not required to take this class for their major, no.","neu"
97993,"Yes, this semester was a lot more engaging and doable than previous semesters, and I could really learn a lot from lectures and sections.","r"
97993,"I would recommend this course to students required to take this for their major","r"
97993,"In its current state, it is a disorganized and, therefore, frustrating course. But Ozan and Alan are new to the course, and the revisions they make overtime may change the course for the better.","dr"
97993,"Yes. Understanding data structures is vital to the field of computer science, and getting hands-on learning with coding/using these structures is important.","r"
97993,"Its required for the cs major and certificate, so yeah I guess. Definitely not otherwise. I have confidence the course will be improved in future semesters!","neu"
97993,"I would recommend this class to a student in a few years when the class has developed a bit more.","r"
97993,"It is pretty easy and low commitment, but if you want to learn some interesting content, just try to skip into algorithms. A good 5th/6th class if you like CS. Workload was pretty low compared to other classes (about 6-10 hours of work) every two weeks.","r"
97993,"Yes -- for anyone interested in studying computer science, it's useful in learning a number of important parts of CS. Though it was a bit disorganized this semester, it was the professors' first time teaching the class and I'm confident that it'll improve.","r"
97993,"Honestly, give it another semester if u cn if they are teaching - you don't want to be a guinea pig. However, even then, it wasn't too bad, feel free.","r"
97993,"Nope, I didn't learn from the class, only from YouTube on my own","dr"
97993,"I would definitely recommend CS223 to another student. I think the course teaches important concepts about data abstraction and algorithmic thinking, and the course instructors have devoted themselves to making the class as high-quality as possible.","r"
97993,"you can't not take this class if it is required for your major","neu"
97993,"Yeah but only if its a requirement. The topics are interesting, but you can learn them in a week on your own.","r"
97993,"This semester was as an anomaly, a period of change as they restructured the course. I still feel like I learned something though, which bodes well for future semesters of 223 once Alan and Ozan have finalized psets and exams and caught all the errors with them (and th autograder)","r"
97993,"probably a prerequisite","neu"
97993,"I would recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about programming and different data structures. The course overall was well taught, and I thought it was rather straight-forward to follow along in class.","r"
97993,"Yes, I think that this course is essential for a good base of understanding in programming and is enjoyable because of the applicable learning content.","r"
97993,"No I would not, unless they needed it for their major. The class was very poorly managed from assignments being changed up until the due date to the auto grader never working. The lectures were a lot less engaging when compared to other classes at Yale, or even other CS classes at Yale.","dr"
97993,"If you have to take it, yes.","neu"
97993,"Yes - this course covers very important fundamentals in computer science.","r"
97993,"If they make improvements to this course then absolutely yes its a great course to take. I did not feel like I learned much this semester.","r"
97993,"I would only recommend this course if it was required for their major. There are many more clear and more fulfilling ways to casually learn data structures if the class is not required.","neu"
97993,"I recommend taking it after CS50 if you have to","neu"
97993,"Yes. I believe that the effort these two instructors are putting into the course will make this course top tier within the next few years.","r"
97993,"I think that data structures are really interesting, but this course could do a better job of organizing the material so that students can focus on the topics at hand instead of stressing over deadlines and program requirements.","neu"
97993,"If you're looking to major or get a certificate in CS.","neu"
97993,"Major requirement.","neu"
97993,"This course is very accessible and interesting for students with any interest in CS that have done some programming before.","r"
97993,"not sure why people who aren't CS majors take this course. i'd definitely only recommend if you have to (aka if you're a CS major)","neu"
97993,"If they want to be a CS major, yes.","r"
97993,"Yes! If you're serious about being in Tech, this is a must-take class.","r"
97993,"If you have to take it you should. Its useful.","r"
97993,"Yes, you need it for the CS major and it's not too difficult after all the bonus points are applied. Additionally, the content is interesting and engaging.","r"
97993,"I would recommend this course to another student who is willing to put in the hours with the problem sets and start the work ahead of time. If you are not on top of the work and don't want to learn by yourself sometimes by trying and failing on PSETS do not take this course.","r"
97993,"No, only take it if you need to. It's not at all a fun class, and although the material is important for an understanding of CS, it's so boring.","dr"
97993,"Yes, I would recommend it. This course was very interesting to learn about the data structures that everyday software uses. I would take this class if interested in CS since I think it is more useful than so of the other intro CS classes and it gives a better representation of what CS is actually like.","r"
97993,"This is a good class for getting coding experience. Although may be tough, the constant practice does make you a better coder","r"
97993,"Yes, I would recommend this class to CS majors and CS-interested students. Although many students in the class are taking it as a prerequisite for majors or the Certificate in Programming, this class covers key concepts that reveal the beauty of CS to introductory students.","r"
97993,"It is required for many CS-related majors, but if it is not, I still think it is a good way to become better at programming.","r"
97993,"Yes, its good for improving your problem solving ability and definitely necessary for any tech related field","r"
97993,"Yes","r"
97993,"Absolutely not unless they need it as a major requirement.","dr"
97993,"Yes, it's necessary to learn C++ for the major, and this course is required","r"
97993,"Yes, but hopefully with the class being more organized in the future. The concepts that this class is supposed to teach are very essential to CS.","r"
97993,"Yes! The course was fun, and I think itll get much more fun and organized as the professors refine it. It was challenging to be taking the first version of the new format for the course, but Im hopeful that in the future itll be better than the old version.","r"
97993,"only if you have to take it for a major or certificate","neu"
97993,"It's a good class if it's not taught by Professor Weide, and you are planning to major in Computer Science.","neu"
97993,"I would strongly recommend this course, as learning about these data structures is fundamental to understanding future concepts in computer science.","r"
97993,"You need it for the CS Major. I think this class has much promise to be better, I just took it at a time when it was transitioning over. I think with the suggestions multiple students have made throughout the semester, it will become much better.","neu"
97993,"I would! It was interesting and a good way to learn about C, C++, and data structures.","r"
97993,"Yes I would recommend this course as it gives students a solid foundation in programming and in data structures.","r"
97994,"Definitely. Perfect to satisfy a CS elective.","r"
97994,"yes, but only another student that has a clear thought out project in mind with the dura materials","r"
97994,"I would take this course if you have an interest in both humanities and computer science, if you're just a computer science student looking for a humanities credit you will be bored by the humanities content in this class if you do not have a vested interest in Dura Europos.","r"
97994,"yes","r"
97994,"It was a very fun course!","r"
97994,"Yes","r"
97994,"Yes, absolutely. Dr. Rushmeier is the best I've had in any class and the course is a great one.","r"
97994,"Yes if you are a CS student looking for an easy humanities credit and also get a CS project out of it.","r"
97994,"This course was interesting from the perspective of a highly technical student wanting to learn about the role of tech in humanities","neu"
97994,"Yes I would. It is a huge opportunity to apply technical skills in the humanities field.","r"
97997,"to CS students with little humanities background or thoughts about CS ethics, definitely a good primer to various hot topics. to students with more humanities basis, maybe something in another department will serve you better","neu"
97997,"Hands down a must-take. Easy to follow material and two professors who were very engaged with the content.","r"
97997,"I would be hesitant to recommend this course. Although I loved the intellectual stimulation, I would only recommend this course if it gets restructured in some manner.","dr"
97997,"Interesting to think about other implications if you're interested in tech","neu"
97997,"It's a decently straightforward credit. Not too challenging or easy. I would recommend it if you want to get a good overview of political issues related to your work in CS.","r"
97997,"Yes because it is a good class that opens your eyes to new ideas around what is happening with software today.","r"
97997,"It is a pretty important topic for people to learn about, so in that regards I would recommend it. But don't do it expecting to develop new CS skills.","r"
97997,"Yes, if you are looking for an easy, low workload cs elective","r"
98001,"I would recommend this course to anyone with pretty significant programming experience who's interested in learning more about computer systems.","r"
98001,"You're probably taking this course because you're a CS major and it's part of the core. I honestly got so much out of it and am glad to have taken the course. Clear your schedule because it's definitely true that the course takes up a large chunk of time; however, it wasn't as stressful/demanding as I had anticipated. Professor Lim did a great job of making the material as approachable as possible, and I think the course will make you a better, more knowledgeable, programmer.","neu"
98001,"This course is not for the faint of heart. I don't even want to think about how many hours I spent in office hours or my own time completing the psets every week because I think that would be too depressing. However, I think that I am undeniably a better programmer than when I started this course, and it is a necessity for any CS major (literally, as the course is a requirement). I can't honestly recommend this course for anyone who isn't majoring in computer science because I don't see how this level of difficulty would be relevant or necessary. For any computer science students who are taking this course, I would recommend designing the rest of your course schedule carefully around it. Be prepared to reschedule your life around office hours.","neu"
98001,"If you need it for CS or if you really like the topic -- if you get through the first week/pset, you'll probably be fine, but keep in mind the high workload and commitment","r"
98001,"I would easily recommend this course to anyone that has the prereqs and is willing to dedicate a good bit of time to it. If you are prepared for what 323 will be (like any CS/CS-adjacent major that has spent time around similar people will be), and you have the time to dedicate to it, it is one of the most stimulating, rewarding, and interesting experiences you can have in the subject. This course has made me so much more interested in systems and makes me so excited for future courses like compilers and operating systems. I gained so much from this course and I am sure that you will too if you can healthily dedicate the 10-20 hours per week that it requires.","r"
98001,"This course is a required course for CS majors anyway. But if you are not a CS major, then taking this course has minimal benefit (unless you are interested in computer architecture and EE). But I would still recommend it. I would say this is a weed out class because it focuses more on you thinking about proficient solutions rather than coding out hard syntaxes. So as long as you understand the materials conceptually, you'll do great on the psets. However it is a weed out class in a sense that if you can't code decently, then you'll struggle a lot. But DON'T BE AFRAID to visit office hours frequently. The staffs were super nice and friendly, and these office hours are literally life savers that carried me throughout the course. So yeah, good luck with it!","neu"
98001,"I would only take this class if I had to for my major, or don't mind having a lot of extra work every two weeks.","neu"
98001,"It's required, but I would recommend anyway for how much you learn and grow - the material isn't the hard part of this class. You hear a lot of scary things about this course, but the only thing that was genuinely tough was the feeling of knowing so little in comparison to my classmates and what it felt like the course expected you to. Every lecture was like a club meeting between the professor and a bunch of overeager freshmen who set the curve. I think the course itself is quite good and interesting, except for the lack of feedback on projects, but the environment as a whole can be very discouraging. Many people work together, some more dishonestly than others, which at times made me feel left out or like I was doing the work but others were unfairly getting through the course. Some more positives are Jay's teaching, how engaging the projects are, and the extra credit opportunities. Overall, just prepare yourself to focus on your own work because comparing yourself to the other people in the class will ruin your experience.","r"
98001,"Yes definitely. It is a lot of work but not always. Some weeks are bad but the majority of the semester is enjoyable.","r"
98001,"yes! Even if you're just taking the programming certificate and don't have to take 323, if you think you might want to take the course, then you should. It's very rewarding and will probably take you up several levels in programming skill+thinking and overall understanding of compilers and OSes, no matter how experienced you think you are.   in-person ULA/TA office hours are notably useful, but to take advantage of them, you HAVE to start early  On workload: Towards the end of the semester I got burnt out and started procrastinating, and ended up pulling 3 all-nighters (one each on the last 3 projects). If you handle 323 this way, you won't feel like it's such a time-sink, but this is also Not Good for your health. You can get ~70%s on the exams and ~90-95% on the programming projects and end with a great grade (which are doable with either all-nighters or being on top of things)","r"
98001,"I would. Albeit a difficult experience, I've learned a lot from it and feel that I have grown from the experience. I'm more interested in systems now.","r"
98001,"Yes. I learned a lot from this course, and even if you don't go into computer systems in the future, the knowledge and skills you gain from this course are invaluable as a programmer. It is a lot of work, but the TAs and ULAs are there to support you, and the instructor also wants to help you succeed.","r"
98001,"If you are majoring in computer science, yes","r"
98001,"Yes, it teaches the core of what computer science is, and I think it does a pretty good job.","r"
98001,"Yes, if you want a high-level view of computer systems. I dont know if this is because the instructor has changed or because of a recent push to make the core courses easier, but I do not think this class is objectively hard. If you have a good understanding of C programming, I can guarantee that you will not have difficulty with this course. The class really does not go into any depth with the topics covered and is more of a survey of topics in systems programming. Sure, you touch on a lot of major topics like compilers, virtual memory, memory allocation, and more, but you only end up programming simple (and rather inefficient) implementations of them. Quite honestly, I wish there had been more freedom in the programming assignments because for a lot of them youre basically just given a bunch of starter code, and its pretty clear what to do from there. Its definitely more work than 223, but I genuinely think that if youre coming into the class with experience in C programming, the hardest assignments should take at most 15 to 20 hours. The exams were a time crunch and probably the most difficult part of the class, but they dont make up much of your grade anyway (at least relative to other courses). If youre genuinely interested in systems programming, I would suggest taking more related classes after 323 because ultimately, the programming projects for this class are not very intense and will cover only cover the basics. Its still a great class, however, and its pretty fascinating how different techniques, hardware, and data structures are used to make computers more efficient and faster. Professor Lim is also very knowledgable, so if you want to learn more, he has the answers to your questions.","r"
98001,"Yes, every CS major needs to understand the ground level of a computer, and CS323 gives you an in depth survey of that.","r"
98001,"Yes, one likely has to take it for the major but it's useful to gain a basic understanding of the low-level workings of a computer and the organization of Linux-like OSes.","r"
98001,"You will learn a ton. Problem sets are brutally long and I think the 20-40 hour estimates are accurate; however, they are interesting and ultimately very doable albeit time intensive. Prepare to sign away your semester to 323 but you will be rewarded.","neu"
98001,"I would recommend this course to anyone that wants a deeper understanding of why computers work and why computers are set the way they are. The class has helped me make optimizations in my code that I never would thought would do anything.","r"
98001,"Yes. Taught me to be a much better programmer overall and is a fascinating look inside the computer!","r"
98002,"Only if they want to learn coding techniques. Lectures are atrocious. Learn from the TA's and the psets. Class would be a lot better without exams.","neu"
98002,"Yes, if they want to improve their Python skills.","r"
98002,"Yes! Very useful class. I come out of it a better programmer.","r"
98002,"Yes, I felt it taught me how to program properly","r"
98002,"Absolutely. Especially if you are a CS major and aspiring to go into SWE, this is very applicable. As I said earlier, it is very relevant and probably one of the more applicable CS courses Yale offers, and I say that as a graduating senior who took 15 CS courses. Barron's lecture's can be dry at times, but he keeps you engaged by creating participation polls through pollEv which are also helpful for practicing for the exams. The PSETS give you substantial practice with OOP in Python. The exams are more than fair as well... Take this class ASAP as it will definitely help you with job/internship interviews too. I know a lot of people say that you can teach yourself this content. Sure, that may be true. However, most people won't soooo just take this class and get a relatively easy credit for CS while learning important skills. Also, I will say that having an expert like Barron who you could ask questions while learning such a core topic in SWE is pretty great. Barron is a nice guy and just wants you to learn, he's chill, organized, and isn't trying to trick you in any way (like some Yale CS professors do who I shall not name here). Overall, I regret not taking this class sooner.","r"
98002,"I would as a beneficial CS elective with a relatively low workload.","r"
98002,"Yes! It's a chill CS elective, and the concepts are interesting and also relevant if you want to go into software engineering. There were 6 psets, some of which were pretty easy, and even of the hardest ones didn't take very long. The exams need some memorization and review of the material, but aren't very conceptually difficult, either.","r"
98002,"If you havent done extensive OOP before and are looking to gain industry-ready skills, definitely! If you (like me) already know many of the topics on the syllabus, I would stay away. Yes, you will find the course easy, but is that really the best use of a Yale education? Dont make the same mistake I did","r"
98002,"Yes, you learn a lot of useful things and become an overall better programmer.","r"
98002,"Yes! Super valuable for those who want to do SWE. The programming projects aren't super hard in the same way a 323 pset is -- the focus is more on organizing and designing your code, which is super valuable and not super common in other CS courses as an explicit focus.","r"
98002,"Yes, I would recommend this class to CS majors and non-majors. For CS majors, this class will teach you good habits in writing code that will help you in later classes. For non-majors this class counts towards a certificate in programming, and this class is a great fit for that program--advanced yet approachable.","r"
98002,"I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants practical programming skills, as it teaches you how to quickly learn APIs/libraries and rapidly prototype solutions in Python applying powerful OOP design principles.","r"
98002,"OOP seems very useful so I'd recommend it.","r"
98002,"Yes, I feel like its a good class to take after 223","r"
98002,"Yes, the most useful cs class Ive taken so far","r"
98002,"If you just need to clear CS classes","neu"
98002,"Useful if you're intending on completing the programming certificate and don't want to take 323","r"
98002,"I would definitely recommend it if you're looking to code in Python for a company. The first two months of content we covered I remember using working as an intern last summer. I wish I'd taken this course before then.","r"
98002,"Yes, since you learn a tonne in the course, even if it can be a bit dry.","r"
98002,"It's a good course, but not to be taken with a lot of heavy workload courses, as the deadlines for continuous assessment may catch one unaware.","r"
98002,"No. The content is practical, but too boring and simple to justify taking a semester long class.","dr"
98003,"Definitely, it's a great course to get some hands-on experience with a unique branch of computer science.","r"
98003,"Yes, if you're a CS major who has only touched software so far (like me before this class), I think it's important to interact with hardware","r"
98003,"This was a really fun class - you learn about a lot of important topics and you get to build physical projects (which is unavailable in other CS classes). Professor Manohar is really engaging.","r"
98003,"I've taken 3 embedded classes at Yale, and I should have taken this one first. Mobile and Embedded Systems with Lin Zhong is another great class, but I would recommend taking that after this and potentially Operating Systems. Creative Embedded Systems is much more about practical embedded in the context of art, and is very fast paced/project based. This class is a good introduction to those less familiar with embedded concepts such as digital and analog signal's (GPIO), interrupt and polling based design paradigms, general principles of embedded systems, specifics of communication protocols and how to interact with various components. I would also recommend taking this after 323 if you want to grasp these concepts from a lower level.","r"
98003,"This was my favorite course of the semester and one of my favorite courses I have ever taken at Yale. I looked forward to working on our ""labs"" (problem sets), which is more than can be said of the work for almost any of my other classes.","r"
98003,"Yes, it is very useful","r"
98003,"If you are an EE student, I am sorry to tell you that this class is a requirement, and yes, unfortunately the class has many CS students who have the unfair advantage of having a great deal of C background. Your best bet is to get someone really good at coding to be your lab partner. You handle the circuits, and your CS friend can handle all the codes.","neu"
98003,"Yes!!!","r"
98003,"Yes, but maybe wait to take it after 323 or take it credit d","r"
98003,"Yes. I learned a lot and I think it is important to understand how hardware and software interact with each other. I feel as if I can pick up an arduino and make any project I want, given my experience in this course. I thought it was a good balance between making circuits/small projects and coding.","r"
98003,"Yes, I would recommend this course. The difficulty and workload is just right, the content is interesting and the professor is engaging.","r"
98003,"Yes Yes Yes. This course is one of the best CS courses offered, and do not worry about the prereqs too much. The course expects a solid understanding from students but there is plenty of room given to ""catch up"" and ask questions about parts you may be less familiar with. Conceptually, it will push you but you come out with such an improved understanding of digital systems. There are so many cool protocols and concepts covered you genuinely will be excited for lecture. Professor Manohar does not simplify the concepts too much and gets you to the place where you can understand them at a fairly high complexity. This may seem daunting at first as it may feel like things are going over your head, but if you ask questions and are consistent with the course, you will learn so much. I cannot emphasize enough how much you should take this course! Professor Manohar is also one of the best professors in the department, and Yale is lucky to have him, so take advantage of it by taking the course.","r"
98003,"Definitely, especially if you're interested in EE/CS but not planning to major in either field. The material is interesting, the professor is engaging and super knowledgeable, and the course is very well organized. After taking the class, I can look at electronic devices and ask ""what's going on in there?"" in a way I couldn't before.   I don't think I would take the class without any coding experience. I took it without first taking any other CS or EE courses (except EENG 202, which is really just a math class), but I had enough coding experience to teach myself the C and C++ I needed. Maybe you could get away with it if your lab partner who was good at coding, and willing to explain things to you. I don't think you need any circuit knowledge. All the circuits built for the labs are fairly simple, although I would expect to spend some extra time on the first few labs if you haven't seen any circuits before.","r"
98003,"Would definitely recommend, pretty fun and not too demanding. The only really challenging part of the course was the midterm, and the rest was pretty relaxed and fun. The final project also made the class worth taking.","r"
98003,"I would recommend this class if youre looking for an introduction to arduino / embedded systems. The content builds off of 323 very well. The course load isnt too overwhelming for a CS class, and there is no final which is nice (only a final project). That said, start all the projects early because they might take more time than expected.","r"
98003,"Excellent class. Even for people who have lots of experience with Arduino, this class dives into the inner workings of microcontrollers and the design of embedded electrical systems. Great for any EE CS or EECS - or anyone interested in low power / embedded design who has some background in C programming. Professor Manohar is excellent - take this if you can!","r"
98003,"Great eecs class, more cs than ee","r"
98004,"Yes if you are CPSC and ECON, try and take it with Dylan he is the best!!","r"
98004,"Yup, the content is interesting, and you don't have much of a choice if you're a CS major","r"
98004,"yeah","r"
98004,"Even if you aren't majoring in CS, I think this class teaches some interesting/useful things. If you're majoring in CS though, you have to take it.","r"
98004,"Definitely, especially if you have a slight compulsion in always doing everything efficiently :)","r"
98004,"Required if you're a CS major, so yes. If you're not, only take it if you have the right background (in terms of data structures) and interest.","r"
98004,"You have to take it as a CS major, so yes.","r"
98004,"I would recommend this course if you want to develop a strong understanding of the theoretical foundation of algorithms.","r"
98004,"Yes. Not only is it required for CS, it's a nice change of pace from coding-intensive alternatives and you do take away strong algorithms skills and familiarity with lots of different algorithms and kinds of algorithms.","r"
98004,"Probably only if you have to take this for the CS major, or just really love math.","neu"
98004,"algos are cool so yes","r"
98004,"Required for CS Majors but accessible to anyone with some background in formal mathematics/ CS 202 / MATH 244","neu"
98004,"yes if you have to take it","r"
98004,"Dylan is really good.","r"
98004,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are a cs major as it is one of the most fundamental topics as a programmer.","r"
98004,"Yes! Required for CS majors, but overall a very good course.","r"
98004,"Yes. Generally, most people are going to take this course to fulfill requirements, but I genuinely thought it was a good and useful class to learn about how to think about different problems. It likely doesn't have a lot of applicability to other fields (outside of stats, CS, econ, math, etc), but is an interesting class if you enjoy the topic.","r"
98004,"Not a crazy amount of work and the content is definitely going to be helpful for interviews but the exams were super difficult.","neu"
98004,"Yes to every student who wants to work in STEM.","r"
98004,"If you are taking this course it's because you have to. If you are interested in theoretical CS proofs and the math of this subject on more than the most basic level you should take a real course like CS 366. The only reason I took this course is because they didn't offer 366 this year and I need it for my major.","neu"
98004,"I would only recommend this course to students who need it as a major requirement. I think that the topics are covered throughout other courses in the CS and math curriculum, so there isn't a ton to gain outside of a major requirement.","neu"
98004,"Yes, it was a good algorithms course.","r"
98004,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone pursuing a career that involves programming or algorithm design. It is extremely valuable to be able to analyze algorithms for their efficiency and correctness. Even if you are not interested in theoretical computer science the though process of contracting proofs is a valuable exercise and will help you convey your ideas to others.","r"
98004,"Yes if you need it for your major or plan to have a career in CS (though you could also leetcode to study algorithms). No if you want a CS elective.","r"
98004,"yeah for a cs major, really important for understanding how algorithms work","r"
98004,"It's a major requirement, but no. If you have any standards for course quality, take intensive if it is offered again.","dr"
98004,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it represents a backbone in the CS major, developing interesting and engaging problems and discussions around fundamental, vital concepts in the field! The course developed my critical thinking and I learned skills useful in life and in many adjacent STEM fields.","r"
98004,"I don't really think I'd recommend this course to another student. I honestly feel like I didn't learn all that much (at least not that much in depth) and I wasted a lot of time reviewing material I already knew. The fact that lecture attendance dipped to 5-10% by the end of the course is pretty symbolic of the quality of information delivered.","dr"
98004,"This is a required course for CS major. But if you are a math or econ major, then this course is also of that type. There is no downside to this course. Just make sure you have some friends taking this class so when you are stuck on intuitions you can discuss with them. I highly recommend this course because algorithm is such a big part of our life, and these problem-solving strategies translate into efficient coding logic (run time is important in most applications) and solutions of real-life problems. This is basically LeetCode stuff. So yeah, I definitely recommend this class as it gives some introduction to modern day CS.","neu"
98004,"Yes, Dylan is an excellent instructor! A few hiccups since it was his first time, but overall a great course.","r"
98004,"This class is required for the CS degree, so there isn't much of a choice here, but I thought that Professor McKay's version was overall pretty good. Attending office hours was necessary for success in my opinion, and with the weekly assignments, the class did feel like a lot of work, but was overall fairly rewarding in the end. Exams were long but fair. Perhaps not as challenging as some of the other CS classes, but still demanded your attention.","neu"
98004,"I mean, you have to if you're a CS major so I guess so.","neu"
98004,"Yes, though you are probably taking it because it is required for your major","r"
98004,"If you are doing cs, it's an absolute must!","r"
98004,"Absolutely would recommend this class! Even if don't think you have any interest in theoretical CS and even if it's not a required class, you should take this class if you're evenly remotely interested in improving your problem-solving skills. This has been my favorite class at Yale so far. I didn't think I was interested in theoretical CS before taking this class, but after taking it, I've been inspired to take higher-level theoretical classes.","r"
98004,"Yes! Algos are fundamental to any computer scientist, and, beyond that, this class was also quite fun since each question is a little puzzle to solve","r"
98004,"Not unless required by your major. The workload is too high to take this class just for enjoyment, and you could easily learn this stuff online if needed. You'll also have have to compete with a lot of ambitions CS majors for a not super generous curve, and the number of problem sets is kind of crazy. They are assigned weekly and take a surprising amount of time.","dr"
98004,"I absolutely would recommend this course to anyone who wants to become a software engineer. It will make you a better programmer and allow you to think effectively about modern programming techniques.","r"
98004,"Yes","r"
98004,"Absolutely not! If you're a CS major, you don't have a choice. If you want to take this class for fun, don't even think about it.","dr"
98004,"I would for a cs major, I had a hard time understanding the best way to interview prep with leet code and wrapping my head around certain concepts. This course covers many of the concepts that come up in interview prep such as dynamic programming.","r"
98004,"Yes, serves as a good introduction to basic algorithms","r"
98004,"I mean every computer science major has to take this course but it is still really interesting! This course taught me new ways to think of problems, so I'd definitely recommend it.","r"
98004,"Yes! I enjoyed it a lot. For me, a lot of what we talked about in algorithms is what I like about coding: finding cool, creative, and clever ways to solve problems (and not having to deal with annoying debugging/actual implementation). The proofs feel, in a lot of cases, kind of dumb, but I guess it's good to know how to do. I found the first half of the course quite easy (under 5hrs/week on psets), but the second half was significantly more challenging, so maybe keep that in mind in terms of planning.","r"
98004,"Yes, but only if you are a prospective computer science major.","r"
98004,"A lot of busywork.","neu"
98004,"I would recommend taking it with Dylan! He is really an amazing professor and cares about teaching a lot! He was constantly trying to adapt the course to better help us when things did not go as planned. The homework wasn't too bad in this class and was worded in a fun way which was nice. I enjoyed the class.","r"
98004,"I would recommend for anyone interested, a solid first class on algorithms","r"
98004,"yes","r"
98004,"Yes! Especially if it is with Prof. McKay! He is a great lecturer and is very helpful in class and outside of class to student questions.","r"
98004,"The reason that this course was super enjoyable was because Professor McKay is a gem. He is an extremely accommodating professor, who cares about his students wellbeing and also is a funny lecturer! I would say that Professor McKay is an accommodating professor (he tried to offer as many office hours and discussion sections for his students & offered a generous, but dangerous, amount of late days - four for the semester).  The class was a little bit lop-sided content wise as we spent a lot of time discussing data structures (as Professor McKay wanted to make sure we had this strong foundation also partially, supplementing our lacking and heterogeneous data structure experience), but Professor McKay agreed that he would teach the structure a bit differently if he taught it another time.   Ed Discussion is a widely used resource for this class (and also something that was super helpful) in addition to the office hours. This is a great course overall and very practical!","r"
98004,"Yes. It was very helpful for a CS student and learning a variety of algorithms","r"
98004,"If you have no experience with graph theory or data structures at all, sure. Otherwise you should probably take CPSC 366. This class is better labeled as introduction to algorithms as it was a bit too easy to the point that I questioned if I was truly learning anything. Almost all of the algorithms and techniques except for maybe flow networks have been covered before if youve taken any discrete math or data structures class. It also seemed like ULAs just handed out answers at office hours, so almost everyone gets a perfect score on the problem sets. Additionally, the class assumes a low level of mathematical maturity which ultimately ends up hurting students who do have experience with many of the topics covered. Although you may see a concept as something that is trivial to prove because its become second nature to you, you will definitely be penalized for not proving it. I guess the content is good for an introductory course in algorithms if you have absolutely no experience with them, but I wish they had offered CPSC 366 this semester for people who were expecting a bit more maturity when it came to what youre expected to prove. Professor McKay is still a great professor, though, and while I disagree with the general criterion for academic performance in the course, I think he does a great job at developing students intuition for problem solving, which I think is more important than any algorithm youll ever learn. Also, the effort put into making the problem sets interesting should not go unnoticed. The problem sets typically had a storyline, and I enjoyed that there was an attempt to make you feel like you could truly apply algorithms to real world problems. In summary, if you have some experience with mathematical proofs and some basic algorithms, I would recommend taking intensive algorithms. Otherwise, this course is probably a good fit.","neu"
98004,"Take it if it's required","neu"
98004,"Yes if you did CPSC 202 or MATH 244, it is a very good class to develop algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills, but you will struggle if you don't have the prerequisites.","r"
98004,"Only if you are doing computer science","neu"
98004,"Yes, if you are a computer science major or interested in algorithms","r"
98004,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I think cs majors should be encouraged to take this course early in the major. It shifted the way that I think through creating my code. The course is also just run very well. The PSET questions are interesting and well designed. Also, the lectures were really really great. Knowledge was built piece by piece, so that it never felt like I had to work hard to understand. Instead, the understanding came naturally due to the way that the lectures were given.","r"
98004,"Yes, it is necessary for the CS major.","r"
98004,"Yes, if you need it for a major","r"
98004,"Yes, but just keep in mind that the grading is not the most fair. You will still learn a lot of important algorithms. There is some repetition from graph search algorithms if you took Discrete Math (MATH 244) previously, but still a useful course to take.","r"
98004,"I mean, it's a requirement for the major. Just don't take it with McKay.","neu"
98004,"I would recommend this course to any current or aspiring CS major. It is a prerequisite for the major, but Dylan is also a great, fun professor to take the class with.","r"
98004,"Yes. This is the first class where I felt like, ""oh, I actually learned something and this is very useful for my future!""","r"
98004,"Algorithms with Dylan is great. He really cares about the course and is an amazing teacher. He will only get better and really wants to make algos a very strong class that vies everyone a strong foundation.","r"
98005,"I would recommend this to any student with a logical mind.","r"
98005,"Yes, probably my favorite course in my first year.","r"
98005,"Take CPSC 366 because CPSC 365, at least this semester, was a mickey mouse class.","dr"
98005,"Yes. It was a great introductory course in Algorithms.","r"
98005,"It is a requirement.","neu"
98005,"This is a good course to take for anyone looking to do CS related jobs","r"
98005,"Yes! Its required for CS but if you are interested in this aspect you will not go wrong if you take it with Dylan McKay. I learned so much!","r"
98005,"You have to take it if you are cs major","neu"
98005,"Yes. For sure.","r"
98005,"Would recommend! If it's required for your major, obv, but even if it's not... Even if you don't have much programming experience! Take it, try it out, can always drop it if it's not your thing... But it's really interesting! These core CS classes, and even the elective ones, I think they really shape the way you look at the world. Data structures, algorithms, OOP, they're all frameworks, mindsets, paradigms, and they're really cool.","r"
98005,"This is a required course for computer science, but would otherwise be with taking if you are interested in solving interesting computing problems and enjoy proofs","r"
98005,"ABSOLUTELY NOT","dr"
98005,"Absolutely not. The class is very tedious and boring and the workload is very high. The psets assigned are intentionally very difficult and take a lot of time to finish. Same can be said for the two midterms. The class is only survivable with gratuitous ULA help. Unfortunately its a requirement for the CS major so anyone taking it doesnt really have a choice so sorry to you folks.","dr"
98005,"Yes, if you're interested in learning about algorithms or think you would use them for something.","r"
98005,"Definitely, as someone who isn't a comp sci major and doesn't have much comp sci background, I feel like this class has opened my mind to a whole new and different way of thinking. It was my favorite class this semester!","r"
98005,"Yes! Even if you're not a CS major, I think it's a great way to develop computational thinking skills, although some of the topics might be a bit pedantic if you're not already interested in CS. Highly recommend.","r"
98005,"If you love math, problem solving, or brain teasers, it's great!","r"
98005,"Yes. Professor McKay is great and there are a lot of office hours and student support, it is a great introduction to algorithms.","r"
98005,"If Prof. McKay is teaching algorithms, take it with him. I've tried to take this class previously and had to drop because I wasn't understanding it. Much clearer and easier to learn from Prof. McKay","r"
98005,"Good introduction to theoretical computer science. Currently required for CS majors, but I would also recommend it to anybody with a strong proof based math background as a computer science gut.","r"
98005,"Probably one of my favorite CS classes so far in that there is basically no coding but lots of training on your problem solving skills with respect to problems that you might get in research, SWE interviews, or more. There's really great TA support from review sessions to lots of OH and discussion section, and Prof McKay and the course staff are very receptive to student feedback. At least 5-8 hours on PSETs just to break down problems and write it up, but the paradigm building that you get around algorithms is incredibly useful.","r"
98005,"yea, intro to algos","r"
98005,"You're only taking it because it's required","neu"
98005,"Yes, the material is very interesting and fun","r"
98005,"Yes! Youre probably taking this for some sort of requirement, but I would recommend this course even more broadly. You dont need extensive programming experience. Just some basic background in discrete math would suffice!","r"
98005,"Yes absolutely. Since it is a required class for computer science, most students are taking it because it is required. However, I would like to specifically recommend Prof. McKay's version of the course because it is very well taught and organized. Since this is his first semester teaching the course, I expect future semesters to be even tighter.","r"
98005,"Yes honestly. I think this course teaches you a new way to think and view the world. If you have any interest in proof based math, I think it's a very cool class to take. It's aimed at CS students, but I think offers useful lessons to all.","r"
98005,"If youre taking this course, you probably have to.","neu"
98005,"Yes if they dont have prior competitive coding experience. Otherwise, Id recommend taking the more intensive version of algos (CPSC 366).","r"
98005,"I would. I believe that this course teaches one the fundamental skills necessary to be a successful programmer.","r"
98005,"It's required for the CS major! But it's also a really interesting class and helps you think about algorithm structure a lot, especially if you don't know a lot about it.","r"
98005,"Yes","r"
98005,"Yes! Good course to take if you want to land a tech job.","r"
98005,"I would recommend this course. It was one of the best computer science courses Ive taken at Yale.","r"
98005,"No.","dr"
98005,"Definitely. Mckay is a super engaging and the thorough professor. He takes his time to make the lectures digestible. Although the material can be boring, Mckay is funny and tries to make it more interesting which is really appreciated. Since this class has people from many different math/cs backgrounds, I think his accommodating teaching style and the teaching staffs commitment to discussion sections was really admirable.","r"
98005,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in computer science, since it sort of provides a new way to think of the world in terms of algorithms and finding patterns.","r"
98005,"Yes to both CS and non-CS majors. This class covers the fundamentals of algorithm design and analysis, which are both very helpful for any technical task. Also the class is well-taught so it might save you some time from self-studying.","r"
98005,"Take it if youre interested in algos. Theyre very cool and a fascinating new way of thinking. Although there are many pros and cons to the course, ultimately theres nothing that should discourage you if you are interested in the content. Be prepared for some frustrations with organization and communication, but also be prepared for fascinating lectures and content","r"
98005,"If you need to take it, yes. I wish the harder topics were taught in a way that was more engaging because Algorithms as a subject is so fascinating","r"
98005,"Yes, I really enjoyed this course and Dylan is fantastic!","r"
98005,"Yes, Prof. McKay was a great lecturer and the course was very well designed to facilitate learning. Additionally, the content learned is pretty useful.","r"
98005,"Yes, I would. Depending on the detail of your proofs, the class is a fair amount of work, but it's rewarding. We covered a lot of different types of algorithms, which I think will be very helpful--both for CS in general, and for coding interviews. Some of the algorithms were really clever, and I personally enjoyed writing proofs.","r"
98005,"I do recommend taking this course with McKay but make sure to pad the rest of your semester with some lighter workload classes. I am a CPAR major who took it and I would recommend it to CPAR majors who want more CS in their curriculum and to improve how you view and solve problems.","r"
98005,"If you're a CS major or want to go into SWE","r"
98010,"Yes, being able to work on the projects was a good experience.","r"
98010,"Definitely, for the wonderful professor.","r"
98010,"Yes! Definitely one of the better upper-level computer science electives. You usually get what you put into Yale, and this class is a great example--higher workload, much higher reward.","r"
98010,"Absolutely. I am not sure when this will be offered again but it is really cool to learn a topic like distributed systems. You cover so much, networking topics, consensus algorithms, k8s, databases, etc. You basically get to see a practically implementation of distributed systems which is super cool and very applicable in the world we live in where streaming services, online apps, and IoT devices are taking over. Pretty much all of the internet uses these systems and it would be criminal to not be exposed to this topic during your CS education. You get to implement RAFT, which is the consensus algorithm that most distributed systems actually use nowadays. Also, Yang brings in industry experts, including the guy who designed RAFT!!, to hold lectures about current developments in the field. It was a neat experience. Also, Yang managed to get Xiao, a former Yale grad, to help teach this course. Xiao is a distributed systems guru who has made significant contributions to Meta's distributed systems and he helped teach the course on only a ULA's compensation, shout out to him! Yang is a very intelligent guy too... he's super nice and really cares about students and their learning. As a result, even though this class is hard, if you stay engaged and do the work you will definitely do well. Don't worry about the grade, Yang awards students who do hard work. Even if this class doesn't get taught again, definitely don't miss out on any other course taught by Yang before graduating... Overall, if this class is being taught TAKE IT! I am so so glad I did and 15 CS courses later, I think this is my favorite I took during my time at Yale.","r"
98010,"100% without a doubt -- as long as they have some solid time to devote to it. Firstly, this course is a great chance to get to know Prof. Yang in an individual setting and to make connections with teaching staff who are extremely knowledgeable (and in some cases are on the forefront of some of the lecture material). Psets: on the time-consuming side and came one after the other without much of a break. Nonetheless, some (such as Raft) were extremely rewarding, as they guide you through building bits and pieces of actual distributed systems implementations with many of the ideas in use in industry. Be prepared for >=10 hours of psets a week. Most test cases were public, grading was fair, and the midterm was a reasonable test of knowledge. The lectures' emphasis on design principles (making tradeoffs, abstraction, etc) and in-lecture design exercises sets this course drastically apart from Theory of Distributed Systems in a way that was strongly appealing to me as a systems-builder. You could feasibly take this course as just another CS credit... but I would strongly recommend slowing down, taking a 4-credit semester, and giving yourself the time to process and pay attention to all the details crammed into the lectures. It's not 323, but the course is an attempt to cover much of the breadth of a massive and expanding field. Perhaps in this course more than any other I've yet taken in the CS department, you get out what you put in: there are so many connections and patterns weaving in and out of the various topics and tools of distributed systems that any effort you can give will be worth it.","r"
98010,"Yes if you prepare to input a lot of time and want to take challenges. The labs are not easy and require a lot of input. But they are quite rewarding.","r"
98010,"Yes, if they would like to dip their toes in distributed systems especially in industry.","r"
98010,"Yes, probably the most useful course after data structures/algos for CS students going into industry, but be prepared to have some very busy and some lighter weeks","r"
98010,"Yes, learned a lot.","r"
98010,"Who knows if this class will ever be taught again so consider this review a tribute to the class. The guest instructor Xiao Shi was the star of the show, writing many of the psets, answering many of the Ed posts in detail, and providing invaluable insight from doing Distributed Systems engineering and research at Meta for 6 years. The content is incredibly cool about the theory and practical aspects about building systems that use distributed machines and the challenges that come along with it. However, sometimes the execution got botched with, in my opinion, confusing or hard to follow lectures. The psets were a great learning opportunity though with us completing an introduction to concurrent programming in Go (~10 hours), a Video Recommender Service to practice RPC networking (~20 hours), Kubernetes deployment (~10 hours), the infamous Raft (~40+ hours), and Distributed Sharding (~20 hours split among a group of at most 3), along with a final project. The first 4 psets were before Spring break, while the last one, midterm, and final project were after. The class felt like a 5.0 workload before break and then 3.5 after break. The midterm was the hardest Ive ever studied for an exam in 30 credits, but it all felt worthwhile as we were given a study guide of questions we needed to know the answers to. While it was a lot of work at times, we were rewarded with lenient grading (with lots of partial credit) and a wealth of practical knowledge.","neu"
98010,"Definitely. Best CS class I've taken at Yale. Professor Yang and TF Xiao really care about your success in the class.","r"
98010,"Yes, I would take this even if youre not planning to go into the field. The topics you cover are important, but keep in mind that youll likely get as much out of the course as you put in. The teaching staff is great and very accommodating.","r"
98010,"Yes! Be forewarned it's a ton of work and some argue Raft is the hardest pset at Yale (debugging it and understanding the paper behind it perfectly is very difficult). That said you learn a ton! I strongly recommend it *if* you have the bandwidth.","r"
98010,"Yes! The content we learned this semester feels very applicable to work in the industry, as we have seen many technologies that are widely used currently (Raft, etcd, gRPC for example). Go was really interesting to learn and it felt like it was the right language for the class with its built-in support for concurrency. I learned a lot through the programming labs (especially with implementing Raft and a key-value store).","r"
98010,"Only if you have a genuine deep interest in distributed systems from a practical standpoint. The lectures are really difficult to follow as Richard speaks really fast and the slides are not detailed, and the attendance of lectures dropped over the course of the semester. I think I learned more from the problem sets though, which were good quality though Raft took a substantially long time (spreading 50 hours over 3 weeks). Overall, I still would recommend as it is one of the more practical CS courses at Yale and you do get a good handling of concurrency programming and RPCs with Go.","neu"
98010,"I would recommend to any student interested in building large scale systems, although prior knowledge in computer networks is definitely helpful/recommended","r"
98010,"yes, I think this is a great course for any CS major who wants to challenge themselves. it's probably the best course out of all the ""hard"" CS electives and possibly all the electives in the department. Prof Yang really cares about making sure that students are well-prepared for industry and spend time actually learning things that are useful. There are plenty of extra credit opportunities available for students, and the psets/exams aren't designed to be impossible or nitpicky but instead challenge students and reward them for hard work. Xiao is also very helpful and responsive as a member of the teaching team. The only thing is, make sure the rest of your course workload isn't super heavy. Some of the deadlines for this class are spaced apart by only a week or so, and you have to be constantly on top of assignments and lectures to do well. The work itself isn't super hard, but it's all about time management. Taking the class with friends is also super useful because one of the assignments can be done in a group, which makes it significantly less work.","r"
98010,"No, it gets less interesting as you go along","dr"
98011,"I would say you probably get out of this course what you put into it... except no one was really putting much into it (as far as I could tell) so it was hard to stay motivated. Working on my final project was the first time that I was like.. maybe SuperCollider IS actually useful for some specific things and isn't just an obtuse music programming language... so perhaps I'll have more appreciation for SuperCollider in the future. From a faraway perspective the stuff we discuss/implement in class is really interesting, but it was just difficult to understand so I don't think I could fully appreciate what I was doing.","neu"
98011,"Yes. If you are into music composition, production, sound, audio engineering, or anything related, there is a lot of useful information in this class.","r"
98011,"If they have any interest in making computer music, I would definitely recommend this course.","r"
98011,"You get to make some cool stuff in this class but supercollider is hard. The lectures started off fascinating but as the semester went on they became more and more hard to follow. Scott is an awesome guy but his slides could use some pedagogical attention.","r"
98011,"Yes! But only if you are interested in music and sound. The course material was really interesting, and the workload was pretty light.","r"
98011,"If you are already into sound synthesis. Otherwise, the class is pretty niche.","neu"
98011,"If you're interested in both music and CS, definitely!","r"
98011,"Yes, I'd recommend it if you love playing with waves and want to be able to create any sound you can possible imagine (plus more!). This could be especially good for EECS or EE majors who are interested in wave shapes, filters, etc. You'll do a lot of hands-on coding and pretty much won't have to worry about theory at all.  The downsides are sometimes unclear guidelines for the assignments, and also very slow grading if you're worried about your grade. But overall you'll become very familiar with an interesting, powerful computer music language that's fun to experiment with!","r"
98012,"Yes, if you need a gut","r"
98012,"Yes, if you want to be a software engineer or work in the startup space. Both require being good at managing a large workload or project in a group.","r"
98012,"Prof. Antonopoulos is a cool guy and you can tell he really cares about the class","r"
98012,"Yes! If you are a CS major this is a fun class, just make sure you have a great group!","r"
98012,"Absolutely - Timos does what we all wish more professors could do; trust us to handle ourselves, but always be willing to help and advocating for us to learn real world skills","r"
98012,"Yes, it was the first time that I built a large scale project from scratch and it has made me a lot more comfortable working in software in general.","r"
98012,"Yes, you can learn software engineering skills which can help you find a good job","r"
98012,"Absolutely! From what I hear, this is a better elective to take than full stack if you want more freedom in what you learn and what you create.","r"
98012,"This is a great course to give you an idea of what is it like to be a software engineer working in a team of 5-7 people","r"
98012,"Yes, great for getting some real-world experience and portfolio content. Several teams have taken their projects beyond the class.","r"
98012,"Yes","r"
98012,"Yes, the course is quite informative and the project is satisfying to do.","r"
98012,"I would recommend this course to another student, especially if their experience with computer science has been largely theoretical.","r"
98012,"If you already have (i) a project idea you're passionate about / have worked on and (ii) several team members you know are very capable, this is a good opportunity to implement that.","r"
98012,"I would recommend this course as it pushes you to create something and go through all the hurdles of learning something new (depending on your experience level) and build up various skills in software engineering.","r"
98012,"Definitely take this class if youre looking for a CS elective. Its probably the best way to work on a side project for credit. I loved this class and Timos is a great instructor. Besides learning real-life engineering skills, you also get to learn a lot of theory and ideas behind software engineering, interact with guest speakers, and improve your coding abilities.","r"
98012,"I recommend this class for anyone looking to undertake a big software project that can go on their resume. There's lot of autonomy, but also not very much structure. This class is very much ""you get out of it what you want to put into it"". So students should keep in mind that they need to maintain motivation to manage and work on a single project throughout an entire semester.","r"
98012,"A good option you need a lighter workload CS elective","r"
98012,"yes, but I would recommend taking full-stack or another programming course first if you don't have much web/app development experience. I would also recommend going into this course with friends so you have people to work with. having done an internship already, I'm somewhat familiar w a lot of the SWE lingo that this class taught, and I wish I took this class before so I could get a good grasp of what the day-to-day SWE life looks like. The lectures are actually super insightful but not many people go","r"
98012,"if theres looking to develop connections and work on something together with others, then yeah","r"
98012,"recommend for those who want to be a software engineer","r"
98012,"Yes. If you want some experience building a project, I would recommend.","r"
98012,"I would recommend this course to those thinking about doing SWE. This is a good way to see if SWE is for you, though I would recommend taking full stack engineering first if you have no school or internship experience with SWE, since that course has a bit more guidance.","r"
98012,"Yes, I think it provides a good environment where you can focus on pushing a product out through the semester and was a good way for me to explore different development practices and technologies.","r"
98012,"Would definitely recommend this class! It was very fun and rewarding to create an application from the ground up with a team, and it is also a good CS elective.","r"
98012,"Yes but only if you are really passionate about the project you are doing and you come into the class with a team already.","r"
98017,"10/10 cs gut as long as you're okay with not having anything graded until the last week of class","r"
98017,"I think the professor really draws my attention by illustrating abstract concepts with detail examples. He is really experienced in this field and also in the field of finance, which adds some more perspectives to his course.","neu"
98017,"Yes","r"
98017,"Interesting concepts and topics and fairly low workload so I would recommend.","r"
98017,"Yes, it was very interesting and the homework assignments pushed you to think out of the box.","r"
98017,"Yes, it is a very interesting course and you can meet a lot of interesting people through it.","r"
98017,"Not a very sane ""gut"" to take because the way the grading works stressed me out all semester given the low rate of assignments and the slow grading time. But otherwise a good course.","neu"
98017,"This is a very light workload class, so good if you need an elective for a major.","r"
98017,"This class is great if you want to learn almost nothing and then get a CS credit for it. This class had a lot of grad students and second-term seniors for that reason. There are 3 psets, a paper, and final project, a lot of which do not use much material from lecture, and can essentially be hard-coded with some simple heuristics. The work for this class was back loaded with before spring break being a 1.0 and after spring break being a 3.0. The work is not intellectually challenging and no exams are nice, but it can take some time to properly do the assignments (up to 10 hours each) so there are classes with less work (but the content of this class is probably easier). There is an abundance of guest speakers for this class though (we had 5 this semester) who are Slades acquaintances and typically, a handful of students will get to dinner with them. Among the likes are high ranking officials from Citadel, Accenture, ex-Google, Yale SOM, and journalists. One last note is that the grading is done by hand (almost no autograder) so expect to be in the dark about your grade for most of the semester since the spec is not particularly detailed (which is a feature not a bug!)","r"
98017,"I would recommend it because enrolling in this class is a fun and rewarding experience.","r"
98017,"Great CS course, lots of intersection with social sciences too.","r"
98017,"I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a more lowkey computer science elective, as the assignments tend to be relaxed and you get the most of the course by just listening to Professor Slade talk.","r"
98017,"yes, it's interesting","r"
98017,"Yes, very interesting course content and excellent guest speakers.","r"
98017,"No with the bad assignment description","dr"
98017,"yes, it is a decent class that was great and fun to take!","r"
98017,"Yes. This class is fairly easy and interesting - despite what others might say, Slade isn't trying to catch you out. Just watch the lectures, go to OHs if you need to and do the homeworks, and you'll be fine. The open-endedness and flexibility in the final project means that it can form a decent section in your portfolio too. The lectures themselves are very ""Slade"" (you will know what I mean if you have took 201), but the guest lectures are very interesting and Slade is slightly more animated, likely because he is more interested in the content. Anyway, the homeworks are fun and open-ended whilst not being too difficult, the final project was interesting, and Slade was very flexible with deadlines and meeting any student needs. All in all, a lot better than 201.","r"
98017,"I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. It forces you to think about the mental / decision-making models you use in daily life and gives options for new models you have not thought of before.","r"
98017,"Yes - the subject matter and potential applications of the techniques learnt and ideas explored are fascinating. The workload is not too heavy.","r"
98021,"Yes, it is useful to be familiar with how AI works.","r"
98021,"I would not, especially if you have an AI / ML background. This course was largely theoretical, with the only application in the form of Pacman projects, which I don't find to be representative of the actual applications you could create with the topics covered in this course. I've outlined all of the weaknesses in another long answer, but overall, I felt the course was very disorganized, and the instructors felt like they didn't care for the course.","dr"
98021,"I would highly","r"
98021,"Yes","r"
98021,"If they want a broad introduction to AI or need a fun and gut-ish CS elective, 100%","r"
98021,"it's a useful introduction to AI, so yea","r"
98021,"To be fair, I think is this a reasonable class to take if you are interested in AI, provided the workload of this class is somehow reduced. For me, it was a little too late when I realized that I am familiar with half of the materials that are covered in this class. It's especially frustrating to have to do repetitive works on subjects that I already have a reasonable understanding of.","neu"
98021,"Yes.","r"
98021,"I would recommend if you've never taken an AI class before. It's a good cursory basics class. I'd caution though that the work can get a little tedious and the grading can be a little nitpicky; plus, there's mandatory quizzes during class, which always annoyed me since they'd be arbitrarily difficult and would penalize people who were sick or away and could not watch the class immediately at the time it was happening. So just be cautious of that","r"
98021,"A very important topic but could probably learn this stuff better through an online course","neu"
98021,"In the future when some more of the kinks in the course have been worked out I would recommend this course","neu"
98021,"I would recommend this course if you have experience with Python and want to learn the basics of AI implementation, but only if you have the time for problem sets that often feel unnecessarily long.","r"
98021,"Go for it! The material is interesting and relevant","r"
98021,"Yes if you would like a breadth of AI knowledge.","r"
98021,"If you already taken the in-depth AI courses in NLP, image processing, and deep learning, then you don't need to take this course as it covers these topics on the surface. However, if you are interested in how AI works in general and want to learn more about these fields mentioned, then this course would be a great start! It gives you some basic intuition, but they are not too much in-depth and are not easy to remember. So it can be viewed as a gut. First 2 assignments seem hard and tedious and can throw many people off, but after these two it's all chill and games. So don't give up ;D","neu"
98021,"Not when taught by the current instructors. In the current iteration of the course, the assignments were extremely tedious and wasted your time, while teaching you very little. On top of that, this course is more similar to an algos course, and does very little teaching about AI","dr"
98021,"Maybe. This is a pretty straightforward AI survey course. The assignments don't take too long and we didn't have any exams, so the workload is not super high. However, the grading can sometimes be harsh and arbitrary/specific.","neu"
98021,"Only if they were very sure theyre interested in AIthis course needs to be restructured.","dr"
98021,"Unfortunately I would not. I think it could be made better and it has the sekeleton of a good course but it was really not well run, the written psets were trivial and annoying as hell, the code was all online.","dr"
98021,"Yes, it was engaging and interesting introduction to the AI/ML space","r"
98021,"I would not recommend this course. The survey style of this course may appear to give a good overview of artificial intelligence, but it is much more worthwhile to take CPSC 474, CPSC 475/480, and/or CPSC 477.","dr"
98021,"yes","r"
98021,"This class overlaps with other CS courses in the same fields quite a bit and I feel like I had learned more/better learned the same content from those classes as opposed to this one.","dr"
98021,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student, since it teaches you the foundations of reinforcement learning, deep learning, etc.","r"
98021,"Be aware that this class is not primarily a machine learning class--it's a much broader class about AI, starting with simpler algorithms. I would recommend this class to a student who hasn't taken very many CS classes yet. I took this class only after finishing the whole CS core sequence, and I found it easier and less in-depth than I would have hoped; if I'd taken it a year ago, I think I would have enjoyed it more. I've heard that the department is considering making an intensive version of this class, and I think that would be a great idea.","neu"
98021,"I would recommend it to other students since one can learn a lot from implementing algorithms and AI systems in coding assignments.","r"
98021,"No.","dr"
98021,"If it's fulfills a major requirement, sure, or if you're looking to take more advanced AI courses in the future. Would not recommend taking this class for fun though.","r"
98021,"I would recommend this to any CS major. Although the class involves a lot of work, it is actually quite low-stress due to the lack of exams. The office hours are an excellent way to get help.","r"
98021,"I'd say so. This class has taken a (completely unannounced) transformation this year, from being the same course under Scaz for years and years to now essentially using the Berkeley AI materials and having brand new professors. They were really supportive which was great, and I liked the weekly quizzes instead of exams. That being said, the grading was really weird - we'd get separate grades for correctness and ""show your work"" on some problems which were then multiplied together, meaning if you (by their questionable standards) didn't show your work you could get a very low grade. Then some of the problems were just straight-up tedious where 90% of the work happened after all learning stopped; that felt like a waste of time. I hope that with the re-numbering of this course to 370 and possible transformation into a required/core class in the coming years, the staff takes the chance to sand out the rough edges and keep only the theoretical/programming parts that are the most fair/conducive to learning.","r"
98021,"Maybe not. In retrospective, there must probably be another class that can teach you how to build these algorithms without you having to go through the unrewarding grind of the PSETS.","dr"
98021,"i would definitely recommend it to people who are looking to learn more about AI","r"
98021,"nice course if you are interested in AI!","r"
98021,"Yes, it is a good introduction to Artificial Intelligence if you've never been exposed to the field. It is not as intimidating as it sounds, and anyone with a decent background of computer science (you should be fine after 201, and 223 is really just complementary) would be okay in the class.","r"
98021,"This course needs a lot of improving.","dr"
98021,"I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about how AI works, but be aware that machine learning/neutral networks are only a small part of this course","r"
98021,"I honestly would not recommend this course to another student. There are other interesting CS electives and honestly this was a course that I was really excited about, but ended up being quite disappointed with.","dr"
98023,"yes","r"
98023,"I would because the content is really interesting (and important, especially today), but be prepared to do some learning by yourself/take time outside of class to think about what was discussed in class. I felt like class moved really quickly and honestly in the second half of the semester, even though I attended most of the lectures, I had no idea what any of the concepts really meant until I sat down to review for the final + watched some videos on YouTube, and then things started clicking.","r"
98023,"I would - NLP is a rapidly evolving field that's relevant in a surprising amount of fields. My experience in the course was certainly stunted, but the underlying components of the course are good.","r"
98023,"I would recommend this course to a student only if they don't have ADHD. The lectures contained a lot of details and only people with long attention span can succeed.","r"
98023,"Generally speaking I would, with recognition that it's challenging. That said, I'm sure much will change given the unfortunate circumstances of the course, so I imagine it will be quite different in the future.","r"
98023,"Yes. The instructors (Drago and Arman) and the TAs are perfect.","r"
98023,"Yes, it teaches a lot about state of the art NLP","r"
98023,"yes. it is great","r"
98023,"We had a unique situation with our professor passing through the semester. I imagine this course will look different in the future. One thing I will recommend is having some background in ML before the class. Itll allow you to engage better because youll be learning about those techniques being applied to linguistics, instead of also having to simultaneously learn the techniques. Its not a hard requirement but I think itll allow you to have a better experience. Without any linear algebra or ML, I struggled to engage with a class that is generally easy to disengage in (this is unfortunately true for many cs classes because of the ability to just address assignments and exams ad hoc instead of paying attention all semester)","neu"
98023,"I would because students can really learn a lot from this class.","r"
98023,"Yes! I think the class covers more breadth than depth in relation to NLP topics (if you have a lot of prior experience) but given most students are taking it with very little exposure to NLP prior, it really helps open your understanding of the different settings that NLP could be used in. We covered everything from the linguistic side to the mathematical side to the architecture side of various models, and the psets had very applicable NLP problems.","r"
98023,"I do not know who will be teaching in the future so I do not provide details","neu"
98023,"Yes. It was very interesting content","r"
98023,"Yes, NLP is quite relevant these days...","r"
98023,"yes, because it's a comprehensive introductory class, just get prepared to work hard","r"
98023,"Totally! For anyone looking to learn NLP, take this class.","r"
98023,"Yes, this is a good moderate workload cs elective that covers a hot topic","r"
98023,"Yes! This course was very interesting, and I learned a lot about the cutting edge NLP models that are behind AI systems like ChatGPT","r"
98023,"maybe","neu"
98023,"Yes!","r"
98023,"Yes, the learning process for the application of models and linguistics aspects were really helpful.","r"
98023,"yes, overall a great class","r"
98023,"Depending on the instructor","neu"
98023,"Maybe yes because it still serves as a good intro course","neu"
98027,"yes","r"
98027,"yes, not too demanding and you learn a lot of helpful stuff that applies outside of computer-related stuff as well","r"
98027,"Yes, if you want to learn about computer science and design at a very broad level, the general practices of user design, and want an easy CS course. I think it is important for CS students to understand the design reasons behind the products they are making, and to be constantly conscious of the user perspective. If you listen in class, you get to hear a lot of interesting stories about design in the technical field. Professor Vazquez also brings in very interesting guest speakers!","r"
98027,"Good gut for the CS major.","r"
98027,"absolutely please take this class you wont regret it, i took it as a freshmen as my 5th credit and i was scared that it was going to be hard to handle but it was a really good experience","r"
98027,"No, since everything I learned was really elementary (i.e. ""how to brainstorm""). The final project was way too stressful and a had lack of clear guidance or instruction.","dr"
98027,"I would recommend it if you are up for mostly working on a Kinect web-app through the semester, with random assignment to groups. You learn mostly from practical experience rather than class. The class itself is fairly chill though I didn't learn as much through it as I had hoped.","r"
98027,"I did not personally have a good time. Randomly being put into groups can lead to some unfortunate outcomes depending on your group. Even if you get put with a good one like I did (and other groups had some real nightmare stories), every assignment feels like an absolute chore because you have to depend so heavily on others. There were still some moments where it felt like I was the only one doing all the planning and thinking on how to get things done. A lot of students, based on the class's reputation, are in the class to ""coast"" and get the credit -- fine, but someone at some points has to actually do the work for the group. The final sprint for A6 was particularly unenjoyable. While the content (better) and assignments (worse) are ok, its a course I wouldn't recommend because of the lack of continued, genuinely interesting substance and frustrating assignments.","dr"
98027,"Yes, it's a pretty easy class to do well in, even if it can be a little unengaging sometimes. It's a good 5th credit course.","r"
98027,"Yes! It is such a great class and Professor Vazquez is amazing!","r"
98027,"Yes, a great way to gain exposure to design principles which will come in helpful the next time you think about ""why"" to build something, instead of just the ""how"".","r"
98027,"This class is like a fine wine","r"
98027,"Only underclassmen.","neu"
98027,"Yes, especially in a high workload semester or as a fifth credit. Very low workload until the final project at the end of the semester.","r"
98027,"Probably. If you're a CS student needing an extra class to tack on, this teaches a lot of cool concepts for design (especially heuristics) and is pretty easy.","neu"
98027,"Yes.","r"
98027,"It was a really great course on HCI and the design process, but just be wary of the randomly assigned group.","r"
98027,"I would recommend this course because of how interesting of a topic it is and how well it is introduced to all that aren't familiar with it. However, beware of the random groups.","r"
98027,"Yes! I think this is a great class that every CS major should take. It isn't super hard, and yet it will undoubtedly make you a better software engineer. There are so many interesting considerations about design you learn in this course and also tools/techniques you can use to make your designs better. Also Marynel is amazing. I swear all of her lectures are Ted Talk level. You can't help but enjoy it!","r"
98027,"Yes I will","r"
98027,"Yes, I would recommend this course if you would like to learn more about the general product design process.","r"
98027,"Yes, if the student is interested in product management/design thinking and likes group projects. Over half of the course is a semester-long group project with a randomly assigned group. If you are a cs major and want a relatively low-workload course to balance out your schedule (ex: took this with 323), this is a great choice. This class is worthwhile for computer science students because it's helpful to learn about approaches to using cs to solve real-world problems and the project is fun.","r"
98027,"YES","r"
98027,"Yes, it was a fun course and I learned a lot.","r"
98027,"Yes. You get to learn and apply valuable strategies without too much stress.","r"
98027,"I would recommend this course to any computer science/cognitive science student.","r"
98027,"Would recommend, especially to CS major! HCI is a woefully underrepresented field at Yale, and it's something that's very important to both other top CS programs as well as to industry. Remember, it's only us who interacts with the computer through bash. Everybody else is using interfaces, so knowing how to design and assess those interfaces is very valuable.","r"
98027,"No, because most of it felt like a waste of time.","dr"
98027,"Yes, very light workload with work nicely spread by the whole semester project. The class was very engaging and really interesting. It was a mix of like a cognitive science, psych, and computer science class which was really cool. Professor Vazquez is a great teacher and the guest lectures were all really cool.","r"
98027,"Because of everything I outlined in the strengths/weaknesses section, I would not. I think this class is likely better for econ students or students interested in becoming business owners/start-up entrepreneurs more than computer science majors, which is who I thought the class would be for based on the syllabus/course name/course listing.","dr"
98027,"Yes, if looking for fifth credit class.","r"
98027,"Yes, if you want to learn the basics of Human-Computer Interaction","r"
98027,"Yes if you want an easy but potentially boring course","r"
98027,"Yeah J think its a good way to learn about design principles that can help you with future projects and work for other classes.","r"
98027,"Mostly yes. If they wanted to learn some theoretical aspects of HIC design, def yes. However, if they had limited skills in web designing and wanted to learn more about it, this course may not be a good option.","r"
98027,"yes. even though it's easy, i think it actually opens the door to getting to know all things user, which can be helpful in finding a user-oriented job later on","r"
98027,"I would not. This class was not particularly useful or interesting, just requiring a bunch of busywork.","dr"
98027,"This course seems to be really great for some people, and a terrible experience for others. It ultimately seems to be up to how much you care about the course content and how willing you are to work in groups that are pre-assigned.","neu"
98027,"Yes","r"
98027,"Not unless the course is geared more towards actually making prototypes and testing.","dr"
98027,"I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a relaxed elective that does not really focus on coding.","r"
98027,"yes, especially if they don't have much cs experience or want a cs gut. it's all group work and a very fair midterm, so you can totally get by with fewer programming skills. the groups are assigned so there's a mix of skill levels in the group. the weekly workload is also very low up until the final project, which also isn't that bad. marynel is a good lecturer and the topics are all very high-level","r"
98027,"Def, a very fun class and a great teacher.","r"
98027,"It's a relatively easy class but the workload ramps up significantly at the end. You learn how to build/prototype projects but ultimately people default to the most straight-forward idea.","neu"
98027,"It's a gut class. If you get lucky, free credit. If you get unlucky, extra work every time. But to be honest, this class makes you realize how significant the field of HCI is. Before I thought HCI is just a humanity + CS subject. But after taking it, I realize that HCI comes in many shapes and forms. It's a multi-major interdisciplinary subject. For example, Mech E + EE + CS + Art + Robotics + etc etc etc. You have to design in an effective way, and ensure the product follows a thorough cycle for the best result. I had a ton of fun doing it, and my management and project structural management skill got a lot better. This class was a great experience simulator, and I had a lot of fun with it.","neu"
98027,"I would if you are looking for a relatively low workload CS elective and want to know a little more about the design process. Theres not much coding involved in this class but a greater emphasis on concepts, so I would take this class if youre looking for some design exposure. Plus you get to create a working project at the end of the semester which can be cool depending on what youre wanting to do.","r"
98027,"Based on the strengths mentioned, I highly recommend this course to other students. It is an accessible option for both computer science majors and non-majors, making it suitable for a diverse range of students. The course effectively combines theoretical knowledge with practical application, enabling students to actively build upon what they are learning. Additionally, the instructor's teaching approach and the overall ease of the class make it a must-take for students. The course offers a valuable learning experience that is both enjoyable and informative.","r"
98027,"Yes. The syllabus and the schedule of the course is very clear. And students can gain the knowledge related to HCI as we expected. And if we work hard, we can get a high grade.","r"
98027,"Yes. Taking this class is a great experience.","r"
98027,"Take this class!!! Before taking this class, I never would have imagined that I could say that this type of class could be rewarding, but trust me, this class is!","r"
98027,"yes, if theyre interested in the field of human computer interaction, I think its a good course to take","r"
98027,"Yes if you know a fair amount of programming + want a more moralistic view of computer science and how it is applied.","r"
98027,"Yes, this is one of those rare non-theoretical CS classes in the department that is actually interactive, dynamic, and shows how it can be tied to much more practical applications (e.g. software development, robotic research, etc.) Professor Vasquez is also one of the few teaching staff who actually cares a lot about making classes dynamic. She's very humble and sweet, but also really brilliant in her field.","r"
98027,"Yes. The workload was never overwhelming and I felt like I learned a decent amount. Great CS elective for a 5 credit semester.","r"
98027,"I'd absolutely recommend this course as a fun, chill elective where you still learn about something very applicable (the iterative design process from start to finish) and implement a cool, interactive project throughout the semester that mirrors the content. The course material is very straightforward and would make a great elective choice for any CS or CS+ major. The organization of the course is also very clear and instructions are provided to ensure little to no confusion, so it is very easy to know what is expected of the student.","r"
98027,"Yes, the material is very useful","r"
98027,"I would definitely recommend this class because you learn a lot and it is not unnecessarily hard like I find a lot of other Yale CS classes to be. It's especially nice to take if you have other high-workload classes.","r"
98117,"yes, v interesting info in a low stress environment","r"
98117,"Yes, I would highly recommend any course with Professor Kim!","r"
98117,"Absolutely! This was a great course with interesting content and a super reasonable workload.","r"
98117,"Yes, I would recommend this course. Professor Kim is a great teacher, and it was very interesting to learn about how to analyze the intersection of religion and culture in the modern world, not just in Korea, but across the globe.","r"
98117,"Yes!! Professor Kim is a fantastic professor, and I learned so much in the class.","r"
98117,"I would not recommend this course, because I did not learn very much and it was not well organized.","dr"
98117,"This class is a fun humanities credit where you can learn about something you knew nothing about previously. For someone who already knows a lot about the topic, the course might not go deep enough, but for a student who is trying something new, this class is really approachable and interesting.","neu"
98117,"YES, it is good to learn about religion and society. Hwansoo Kim is a great professor to converse with about your own religious views and thoughts. He is very respectful, someone who you can learn a lot from.","r"
98117,"Yes, its a very enlightening class that will not be stressful workload-wise.","r"
98117,"YES, must take even if you're not Korean or religious","r"
98117,"Absolutely. Just go to lectures and have fun listening to professor Kim. He is super engaging and you will not regret taking this course. There are no tests/quizzes, you can just go to lecture and enjoy it, and the coursework is super light. Take this class for sure.","r"
98117,"I would definitely recommend the course to others who are interested in religion and specifically religion and culture in Korea.","r"
98117,"Yes! Its a great course that focuses on the joy of learning rather than worrying about grades! Professor Kim and our TA, Jusung, are also incredible and makes the course incredible and fun! This is the class you look forward to going to each week because of how interesting it is! Take itttt!","r"
98117,"I absolutely would! I love the professor and the TF, theyre absolutely lovely and always willing to talk.","r"
98117,"YES, best class ever","r"
98117,"While the workload is less than average, the intellectual challenge + knowledge one receives is high. Its really a class that is easy to gain from because it is an unfamiliar topic that addresses multiple assumptions. If you are wanting to decipher religion or Korea just a bit more, take this class. If youre interested in learning more about your Korean heritage, take this class. If youre interested in a unique outlook on religious studies in a casual, fun format, take this class.","r"
98117,"Yes! Professor Hwansoo Kim is amazing and really puts in an effort to get to know all the students personally. The class is very insightful and makes you think a lot.","r"
98117,"Yes !","r"
98117,"yes, especially as an introduction to the topic for those interested in learning about both korea and religion","r"
98129,"I would. A good survey course for this period of Japanese history. If you're looking for a basic history lecture with an average workload and a knowledgeable/passionate professor, this is a good option","r"
98129,"Absolutely. I've found myself citing class topics in conversations with friends at least every week, if not more often.","r"
98129,"Yes","r"
98129,"Absolutely, this is my favorite class I've taken at Yale. If you're just looking for a humanities credit or are a history major, this course is absolutely worth putting on your registration worksheet whenever it appears. Workload is relatively low, which lets you dig into the material without much stress. The course mainly consists of 50 pages of reading per week (with one notable exception for a book after Spring Break), one pset, and two exams. There was also supposed to be an essay, but this was made optional in exchange for the final being worth more.","r"
98129,"Absolutely! I think this was my favorite course that I've ever taken at Yale. Drixler is an incredibly engaging lecturer. 75 minutes goes by without even noticing because you're so invested in what he has to say.","r"
98129,"Absolutely, especially if they're interested in pre-modern history. The course touches on all aspects of Edo Period Japan so you can get a holistic view of the period.","r"
98129,"yES","r"
98129,"Yes! The time period it teaches was very interesting and Drixler's knowledge of art and culture enriched his lectures. I enjoyed coming to lecture everyday and the readings were interesting.","r"
98129,"I would recommend this course to students interested in pre-colonial Asian development of countries, because of the extensive cover of knowledge. I would also recommend for anyone interested in Japanese history.","r"
98129,"I would, with the caveat to study a lot for the map quiz. For someone such as myself who knew little to nothing about Japanese history before taking the course, Professor Drixler made the history of Japan fascinating and engaging, and contextualized it in broader patterns of world history up to our present day. One should take this course for Professor Drixler's lectures, if anything, as he is one of the most eloquent lecturers at Yale.","r"
98129,"I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Japan or history in general. Professor Drixler is an excellent lecturer and the content is fascinating.","r"
98129,"Yes! Especially for History majors, really interesting deep dive into another countrys history and culture. What a good history lecture should be. The 75 minute time slot was a bit long/unnecessary sometimes, and the exams require A LOT of studying if you dont have foundation in the content (like I didnt), but worth it.","r"
98129,"Yes! The class and the discussion section were the best i ever took at yale! Prof Drixler is amazing!","r"
98129,"Would highly recommend to any student as a credit for their major or if they want to learn about Tokugawa Japan and the way its society was structured. The professor and TAs are all incredible, and the history is so fascinating. Outside of this class, it would be difficult for an English speaker to otherwise gain a holistic view of Tokugawa Japan. The readings are carefully selected, and super interesting in themselves. Lecture handouts help students grasp the general history, while it is highly recommended that students go to lectures to do well on the exams, as the lectures themselves go in-depth.","r"
98129,"Yes! This class was a great first history lecture. It was relatively low workload with readings, and I found it enjoyable to study for the midterms and finals.","r"
98129,"Yes, absolutely. I was drawn to this course because of a mix between genuine curiosity and a need to fulfill the pre-industrial/geographic distribution requirements for the history major. Japanese history is full of interesting people and dramatic events, Professor Drixler presents them very well. Lots of fun, low stress, and room to enjoy learning for its own sake--sometimes rare at Yale.","r"
98129,"Yes!","r"
98129,"YES!!! 100% take this class. On the first day of lecture, I was a bit unsure if I wanted to continue with this course, but sticking with it was the best decision I could have made. This class quickly became my favorite of the semester, maybe of the entire year. I'm a history major, and I had never taken an East Asian history class before, so it was all very new to me and so fascinating. Professor Drixler is an amazing professor and keeps each lecture captivating. Even though lectures are long (75 minutes), they feel as though they fly by. Due to this class, I'm now considering taking L1 Japanese, and I'm also taking other history and anthropology classes that focus on Japan.","r"
98129,"Anyone interested in Asian history, diplomacy, demographics, and Japanese culture should take this course! Truly amazing.","r"
98129,"Absolutely! I loved the lectures and the readings were very well designed to fit the course themes and lectures.","r"
98129,"For anyone who is interested in Japanese history, or East Asian history as a whole, this course should definitely be on your radar. The course covers a really unique time period leading up to the Great Peace, as well as some of the fallout from it, while also questioning how certain themes and practices of the time period we are studying relate to other occurrences in various parts of the world. You don't need a background in Japanese history or Japanese to be able to gain insight from this course, making it a great gateway course into East Asian Studies for someone at any level.","r"
98156,"If a student is interested in studying economics","neu"
98156,"I would. It is a good intro course, and the concepts matter in the real world","r"
98156,"Yes I definitely would recommend this course to another student who is looking to dive into the economics world. The teacher is engaging and tas are very useful and instructive.","r"
98156,"No unless you need a QR","dr"
98156,"Yes! Very accessible as you dont need calculus or anything like that. High school algebra is sufficient. It was also a great introduction to economics.","r"
98156,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are considering studying economics. It gives you a good taste of the major.","r"
98156,"I would recommend this course to a student interested in economics as microeconomics is the foundation.","r"
98156,"No; the material was organized in a way that was unnecessarily difficult to understand. Slides were not posted on time, laptops were discouraged, and people would show up to review session before the exams and learn completely new concepts by doing problems that simply could've been done in class.","dr"
98156,"Honestly the lectures are really pretty good and discussion section is pretty helpful","r"
98156,"Only if there are recordings.","neu"
98156,"No, not the course itself, but 115 is a pretty common prereq for a lot of other cooler classes, so in that sense I would recommend it.","dr"
98156,"Sure, it's a good intro to microeconomics","r"
98156,"I mean it was fine just for the QR, but as someone who had no previous econ experience and wasn't planning on studying econ further, it was not totally engaging.","r"
98156,"Necessary prerequisite for many higher level economic courses. Would recommend the large lecture class with a better grading curve than ECON 110. Although grading curve is generous, definitely still need to be well prepared for exams.","neu"
98156,"Yes, this class is a good foundation in economics.","r"
98156,"Yes, for sure!! This is a very worthwhile introductory course.","r"
98156,"I would recommend this course. The subject matter is pretty interesting, and professor Berry is a very skilled and entertaining lecturer.","r"
98156,"I would recommend this course to another student as learning the basics of Economics is good background information whether you are an econ major or not, and it is not very hard at all so will not need to be a large time commitment outside of class.","r"
98156,"No, not if you havent already taken economics or Calc, or if you care greatly about your GPA. Its really difficult to get an A in the class so be weary of that, it is absolutely NOT A GUT.","dr"
98156,"I would because it provides a good introduction to microeconomics. I think this is an important piece of knowledge to have with you as you leave college, even if you are not an Econ major.","r"
98156,"If a student intends to pursue economics, this is the necessary introductory course and it's pretty effective.","r"
98156,"Maybe, I think it will probably be helpful later on but the concepts were very difficult for me when I learned them in lecture and I only understood them when they were explained to me in office hours.","neu"
98156,"Yes, I thought it was interesting.","r"
98156,"Yes! While the content may not always be the most engaging due to the introductory level of the course, ECON 115 nevertheless contains extremely pertinent and useful information also for a non-economics major like myself, by providing a solid foundation to an economics way of thinking about the world in terms of supply, demand, utility, opportunity cost and marginal analysis.  Insights into the basic function and efficiency-problems / market failures associated with e.g insurance, government subsidies, taxes, and minimum wages will be useful in everyday life. To have gained a basic outline of ways to criticize but also appreciate the free market and perfect competition will help me understand and evaluate the arguments of economic debates that I encounter in the news or during national elections.","r"
98156,"No simply due to the lack of organized notes as I said above. Studying for and keeping up with this class was extremely hard.","dr"
98156,"Yes, this was my first econ course, and I believe that its beneficial for everyone to have a basic of understanding of microeconomics regardless of major since we are faced with economic situations and decisions on a daily basis. I found the material to be interesting overall, and Prof. Berrys lectures were engaging. I would note that the workload is not too bad but not quite a gut.","r"
98156,"Only if you have to take it as a major requirement!","neu"
98156,"Take this class only if you plan to major in Econ","neu"
98156,"I would definitely recommend this course!","r"
98156,"No I wouldnt. The subject matter was very dry and uninteresting and the professor was not the best.","dr"
98156,"Yes. I learned a lot.","r"
98156,"I would only recommend this course if you are interested in economics and the math that comes with it. Well I do feel I learned a little about the business side of things most of the class is just math.","neu"
98156,"Im not sure.","neu"
98156,"I would recommend this course to another student only if they are interested in economics","r"
98156,"Yes! Great introduction with manageable workload","r"
98156,"Yes, if they are interested in Economics. If they are not interested in economics, I would not advise them to take this course.","neu"
98156,"Yes, if youre an econ student or if you want to learn more about microeconomics.","r"
98156,"Yeah I guess. Take it in the fall though.","r"
98156,"If it was required. It's not too difficult, just annoying and time-consuming.","neu"
98156,"Yes - important foundational info, just not fun to learn","r"
98156,"This is not a fun introductory class. It will give you the basics of microeconomics, but the ""Ceteris Paribus"" scenarios in which we learn the concepts feel pointless to understand. If you have an interest in economics before coming to Yale, then take the course to get a feel of what econ is like at Yale. If you have no prior econ experience, then be ready to be disappointed by this introductory class.","neu"
98156,"I would, it is engaging, and even for non-Econ majors, is a great way to learn how to view the economy and make smart financial decisions.","r"
98156,"Yes! It gives you foundational understanding of economics","r"
98156,"I would! I think Prof. Berry did a great job of bringing us to an understanding of MicroEcon. It is a great balance for the starting economic student; it is engaging and difficult, but not so difficult that it weeds out all of those who are on the fence, and not so esoteric that a beginner couldn't grasp it (but also not too elementary). A perfect mix and a very important class for a young college student!","r"
98156,"Yeah, even if you are not planning on majoring in econ, it's a good class to take a quintessential college class. However, if you feel comfortable having done econ before, maybe try to skip it and go into intermediate (I sometimes wish I did.) But it's a low workload class for sure, especially spring semester.","r"
98156,"If youre in humanities/social science, this is a really good QR to take. Micro provides you with a lot of baseline knowledge that is super helpful in the real world. You also dont need to be super engaged to do well.","r"
98156,"Yes, it is a good intro to Econ course.","r"
98156,"I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are majoring in something that requires any level of economic application. I think the topics covered in this course are pretty wide-ranging in the fields they may apply to and it's helpful to have this knowledge in your back pocket as you navigate other courses, even if Econ 115 isn't necessarily required as a prerequisite.","r"
98156,"I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about economics. It gives you a quantitative understanding of economic concepts that are widely discussed, and deepens your knowledge overall. It is a good introductory course that encourages students to study more economics rather than deterring them.","r"
98156,"Ya sure. Its a good introduction to econ.","r"
98156,"Yes, if you are really interested in Econ and maybe are doing the major. I took this class because I had never taken an econ class in my life and I wanted to take one. If you are having these same thoughts, you really don't need to take the course.","r"
98156,"I would recommend this course to another student if they are truly interested in expanding their knowledge of the economy/majoring in economics. Otherwise, I feel as though there are more academically fufilling/engaging classes offered at Yale.","neu"
98156,"Yes I would! It was a good introduction to microeconomics, especially with Professor Berry.","r"
98156,"If you're looking for a QR and have no prior experience with microeconomics, no. Not the most interesting content and it's easy to get confused if you're not used to that way of thinking.","dr"
98156,"Yes, I think that this is a good course to broaden your horizons and it's large enough that you're likely to find a friend or feel like there are always individuals learning at the same pace as you. Unlike major requirements, I think that ECON 115 is a great course to take for a social science credit or just out of interest as it would fit nicely into one's schedule.","r"
98156,"I would not unless you are an ECON major because it does not help the average person if they want to learn financial literacy or day to day economic details. It is also not engaging and you have to put in a lot of extra time if you really want to get the concepts.","dr"
98156,"It is a required course for many majors.","neu"
98156,"I have never taken any economics courses before coming to Yale, and this class definitely presented me with a new way of thinking about and modeling complex problems in a way that felt like a good intellectual challenge. I would recommend this course to Yale students who are interested in pursuing economics in the future or to students who are generally interested in gaining a basic understanding of models and logical reasoning in economics.","r"
98156,"Yes, I believe that microeconomics is an important topic and that it was taught well.","r"
98156,"I would. As someone who is not going into this kind of field, I still felt like what we learned could help me understand the flow and exchange of money on a micro level. The topics cover a balance of relevant abstract concepts and mathematical formulas. I wouldn't recommend the course to someone who doesn't want to put the time into actually learning and practicing the material, because without the drive to learn, you might get lost.","r"
98167,"This course is awesome even for non-majors. Gives you a good overview of the global economy and your place within it.","r"
98167,"Yes, it was a good introductory course.","r"
98167,"Yes. I think that any student who is trying to get an introductory/ basic understanding of macroeconomics would benefit from taking this course. It is very easy to keep up with, and facilitates student learning well.","r"
98167,"Yes. Gives very good explanation of essential macro topics.","r"
98167,"Only if they are interested in majoring in Economics.","neu"
98167,"Yes, because I think these topics are important for financial success in general.","r"
98167,"Yes. Good intro class.","r"
98167,"I took this course to better understand macroeconomics, but I have no interest in going into any kind of Econ-related career. At times, this course was frustrating because it felt more like career prep than intellectual learning. That being said, I think that understanding how the financial sector works is important, even if its not all that interesting for people who have no interest in the profession. If you dont want to go into finance, I would just consider that before taking the course.","dr"
98167,"I mean I guess if you want to learn more about money and things like taxes and banks and stuff. Most people are just doing it for their major.","r"
98167,"Yes, but take it if macroeconomics interest you (unless you are an economics major)","r"
98167,"Yes, as long as Hawkins is the course director. He really makes the course run.","r"
98167,"Yes, it was a very well taught course.","r"
98167,"No; I feel like their are more intellectually stimulating and fun classes to take. Would recommend if it is mandatory for major.","dr"
98167,"Yes","r"
98167,"Yes, it is a good intro to macroeconomics","r"
98167,"Yes because I think it covers material everyone should have a basic understanding of, but I didn't particularly like the course.","r"
98167,"Yes.","r"
98167,"Yes, great class that teaches more about the current economic state of the world and the factors of governments and economies that affect our future","r"
98167,"Eh if you gotta take it you gotta take it.","neu"
98167,"I would only recommend this course to economics majors.","r"
98167,"Yeah sure if they like economics, however dont feel pressured to since its a big class and friends might be","r"
98167,"Yes, it's not only a requirement, but it also covers plenty of genuinely interesting topics and ideas.","r"
98167,"If you're taking this class, you're probably an econ major. If you are not an econ major, I would recommend this class because it gives you insight into some important concepts however don't feel like you're missing out if you do not take it.","r"
98167,"Definitely","r"
98167,"Yes! The final was really hard, but I got through it. It was a pretty enjoyable class and the material on exams is pretty understandable. I liked the class.","r"
98167,"If you are interested in learning more broad base economics, I recommend this course.","r"
98167,"I would recommend if you need to take introductory macro","r"
98167,"Definitely - a super solid course with real-world applications. It's not too difficult, but not a complete waste-of-time-gut either.","r"
98167,"If they are interested in macroeconomics, yes. But if not, then this course may not be very enjoyable since it requires a lot of memorization of macroeconomic facts.","neu"
98167,"Yes I would - very engaging","r"
98167,"yes very good intro to macro","r"
98167,"I would definitely recommend this course! It's a great intro to how our national economy works and interacts with those around the world. It was also great in explaining issues with our current economy that our generation will encounter. Dr. Hawkins was also the most organized, engaged course director of all time!","r"
98167,"Yes the course is very well organized","r"
98167,"Yes! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn basic knowledge about how our system works.","r"
98167,"Would absolutely recommend to anyone who wants to understand how the works. Macroeconomics is a great way to understand why large-scale movements in the economy happen, and why those movements matter. Would recommend to anyone who's interested, even if you haven't taken micro before.","r"
98167,"Yes, great lecture","r"
98167,"Yes, if you want to get some world-class teaching from some very good professors who will teach you the basics of Macroeconomics. I appreciate Tsvinski's attempt to include some of his own research into the class material, so just know that the class is facilitated to help you succeed... for the most part.","r"
98167,"This course is great for understanding real-world events and is definitely relevant for all that's going on in the economy today.","r"
98167,"Yes I would if the student wants to learn about macroeconomics.","r"
98167,"No, I would not recommend this course and this is coming from someone who loves economics and is majoring in it. If you need to take it then of course do so; however, if you are considering taking it just to learn about econ do not. The admin who grade and create the exams are terrible. They are extremely unforgiving in terms of giving students credit and the questions were so poorly written at times it blew my mind. The professor is good but otherwise all the other aspects of the course infuriated me.","dr"
98167,"I would. Good class","r"
98167,"Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It was very well organized and provided an important overview of introductory macroeconomic concepts.","r"
98167,"Yes, it is helpful to understand these concepts.","r"
98167,"Nah","dr"
98167,"Yes Id recommend this to anyone; it may not be the coolest course, but it provides important foundational understanding of economics that is applicable to any field!","r"
98167,"Yes if they want to understand the financial system","r"
98167,"Yes! It's an intro class, and it's likely just a pre-req for most people taking it (me included), but I truly feel as if I understand so much more about the world now. I can read about economic concepts in the news (the fed, the money supply, bank failures, inflation, etc.) and understand what is happening and WHY it's happening. The workload of the course wasn't ridiculously high, so I 100% recommend it!","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course to another student if it was part of their major requirement. However, outside of that I probably would not recommend it. This is because it does not provide a QR credit and can be difficult to navigate. I also feel as though it is a very independent course; I along with many of my friends had to go through each slide again to completely learn and absorb the material.","r"
98167,"Would definitely!","r"
98167,"Yes! It gives good foundations in topics that are relevant for everyone, not just econ majors; especially because Prof Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins work hard to make the course international, integrate cutting edge research, and be super up to date with everything (bringing in topics like bitcoin, China, climate change, etc).","r"
98167,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I really liked the class and I feel like I learned a lot.","r"
98167,"Yes. You learn a lot.","r"
98167,"Yes to learn basic principles about the economy that are applicable to everyday life","r"
98167,"Yes, I would. I thought the course taught me a lot about how the world works, and found the lectures on monetary policy and trade particularly useful; I feel they gave me tools to better understand the world around me.","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course whether you want to major in econ or not. The professors are amazing and they are there to help in any way.","r"
98167,"Yes, it was a great way to get exposed to economics.","r"
98167,"Yes it helped me get an economic perspective on current events","r"
98167,"Yes, very good way to get into economics","r"
98167,"Yes, take it if you must or want to.","r"
98167,"Yes. I think that it provides amazing insight into how the world works. It gives you a really deep foundation in econ.","r"
98167,"Yes, it was a great foundation for anything else related to econ or finance","r"
98167,"yes, if you are interested in majoring in econ and/or econ in general. would not take if you are trying to get a requirement there are easier classes to fufill requirements.","r"
98167,"Yes!","r"
98167,"I would highly recommend any Yale student to take this course.","r"
98167,"Yes, as it is a standard introductory course. However, it may be a little dull but required. I think the information I learned is important and I don't regret taking it.","r"
98167,"Yes! If you want to learn more about how the world works according to classical theories of macroeconomics, then this class is for you.","r"
98167,"I would strongly recommend everyone take this course. If you want a crash course in economic literacy and dont want to get a bad grade, just cr/d it. Youll learn a ton about economics, and if thats something that interests you, then this course is for you.","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course to a student who wishes to become more financially literate.","r"
98167,"I wouldnt necessrily reccomend it, as a likely econ major I have no choice but to take this class. I much preferred econ 115 and have heard good the 116 is ususally not bad but I really did not enjoy this class.","neu"
98167,"Yes! I think it sucks that you have to take micro to get it because I think the knowledge that we learned from there that shows up in macro can be learned without having to take a whole class. Its relevant to our daily lives and current issues. I really value the information I learned","r"
98167,"Yes, definitely. It's super important in gaining a introductory knowledge of macroecoonomics.","r"
98167,"It's a very versatile class especially if you're considering monetary/public policy so there's no question of its utility. That said, while not unreasonably hard, it can be tricky with the curve as your grade largely comes down to whether you've memorized more definitions than your peers. Also, I would go into it expecting the curve to be harder than micro since many of the less serious people drop econ after first semester. The lectures also had a tendency to drone on and be less efficient than they could be (although the lecture summaries were a nice touch).","neu"
98167,"Yes I would take it again because it was very informational.","r"
98167,"I would, primarily because it is a requirement for the Economics major. The course can be at times stressful, but I think it is primarily because there is so much more material that I was expecting (a lot more than Introductory Microeconomics).","r"
98167,"Yes, you should absolutely take this course. It's essential for anyone who wants to be an informed, critically thinking citizen. If you're interested in pursuing additional economics courses or a career in finance, it's especially valuable.","r"
98167,"No it was difficult and not clear in its content.","dr"
98167,"I would definitely recommend this course to others, but no for the professor. If Professor Hawkins was teaching the course I would highly recommend it","r"
98167,"Yes. If you are someone who has an interest in economics or even business I would recommend taking this course.","r"
98167,"yes, if they are interested in the economy on a broader scale","r"
98167,"Yes, absolutely, even if its not for major requirements.","r"
98167,"would recommend for the general economic knowledge!","r"
98167,"I would recommend it to students who need it for their major or for other requirements.","r"
98167,"Absolutely! The professors are very engaging and have very different styles of teaching to facilitate each students needs. Although it may feel overwhelming at times, if resources are used right and you keep yourself engaged with the material, its a great course!","r"
98167,"Yes. It is a great class, and I learned a lot.","r"
98167,"Yes if you need it for your major or want to take a social science credit that isn't super intense.","r"
98167,"I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about global trade and applicable aspects of economics.","r"
98167,"Definitely! Having a solid understanding of the global economy, along with historical context and current issues is very important for anybody.","r"
98167,"I would recommend this to students who have to take it for the major or students very interested in the topic. I would not say it is a class to take for fun. It can be challenging at times.","r"
98167,"Yes. Take this class if you are interested in anything related to not just econ but also social sciences. Also good knowledge for managing your personal finances.","r"
98167,"Yes. I think all students should be required to take this or any other economics course, because it truly does change the way you look at the world. I bet that half the students at Yale couldnt tell you exactly what the banking system or Fed do, which is unfortunate because of how important of a role they play in our lives.","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course to another student. It is really applicable to the nature of global economics and I think everyone should be aware how the economy works.","r"
98167,"Yes, if they want to know general knowledge of macroeconomics","r"
98167,"Yes, it has a lot of real life applications","r"
98167,"I would because I think the information is very useful to know in life and you get a very nice overview of the subject","r"
98167,"I would! I think its a nice introduction class to learning how economics is generally applicable to everything around us and hones us in onto macroeconomic issues that are beyond the U.S.","r"
98167,"I would. If you need a social science credit, it's a good choice. Learn a lot, not too much work.","r"
98167,"Yeah I learned a lot and I enjoyed the lectures","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course to another student. I think it's a great stepping stone to start learning about economics.","r"
98167,"Yes, since it is a gateway to future econ classes. However, even if you are not looking to continue Econ I would recommend it because it gives you a good big picture understanding of how our economy runs and what policies are implemented by our government.","r"
98167,"Yes, I would. I think the contents of this course are extremely essential in the context of world affairs.","r"
98167,"Yes, its an important introduction to macroeconomics.","r"
98167,"Yes, good class to learn fundamentals of macroeconomics.","r"
98167,"Essential course for Economic majors, but also helpful to non-econ majors to understand macroeconomic policy and how it affects your life","r"
98167,"Yes you learn a lot of applicable skills in this class","r"
98167,"Yes, especially if you're in the major","r"
98167,"Yes if interested in Econ or EPE major! Definitely take it in the fall rather than the spring","r"
98167,"Yes, if they plan to major in economics or if it is concentration related, I would recommend this course. Otherwise no, there are better ways to use their time here.","neu"
98167,"I would recommend this course. The number of resources available makes your success really coordinate to the amount of work you put in, therefore, it can be very satisfying.","r"
98167,"Yes if they are interested in or majoring in economics it is a must.","r"
98167,"Yes. Great course for intro econ.","r"
98167,"I would if the student has never studied macroeconomics and wants to learn more about it. I had already self studied a little and found that the course did not really add to my understanding of macroeconomics.","r"
98167,"Yes, as it gives more insight into what media says about the economy and it can help break down some otherwise deceiving political statements. It would be important to note that the models seen in class are of course only models, and dont speak much about political economy.","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course for people interested in how markets work","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in economics, or just wants to get a better understanding of the way the economy works.","r"
98167,"Yes as I believe that this knowledge is applicable in daily life and gives you a better sense of how the world works","r"
98167,"Yes, I learned a lot.","r"
98167,"Yes for anyone who wants a better understanding of how the economy, and more broadly the world, functions.","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course to another student if they enjoyed microeconomics and are also interested in a larger, global view of economics.","r"
98167,"Absolutely - if you are looking to gain a fundamental sense of macroeconomics and are genuinely curious about how countries function in more ways than just economically, this is the class for you.","r"
98167,"Sadly I was required to take this course but sure","neu"
98167,"Yes. Honestly, before taking the course, the only thing I knew about GDP was what it stood for. I had no real idea of what it measured, and how essential it was for the entire course of macroeconomics. Additionally, learning about financial crisis and how we attempt to prevent and respond to them was very applicable to real life, especially with the Silicon Valley Bank Bailout that happened during the semester. We even had a problem set devoted to this event, which I really enjoyed learning about. Overall, I have a much better understanding of how our economy works, and even if I don't pursue economics in the future, I'll always be able to understand what I read or watch in the news 10x better.","r"
98167,"If you have to take it for a requirement, then yes. For the average non-economics major out there, DO NOT TAKE THIS!!!!! You will have such a horrible time learning it because unless you love economics, this content is not enjoyable.","dr"
98167,"Definitely. You learn a lot that helps you be an informed citizen, and you understand trends regarding the economy. Professor Tsyvinski is a great lecturer and very engaging. He's obviously passionate about what he teaches.","r"
98167,"Yes, only if they are interested in the Major or need it as a prerequisite. The course by itself is not very engaging and I believe it is not well taught.","r"
98167,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the topics covered span a broad range of topics and allow you to understand the theory behind issues such as unemployment, climate change, etc. that affect the world.","r"
98167,"Yes, I think that this class is a foundational course.","r"
98167,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I thought it was graded very fairly and the material is relatively easy to understand, it just takes a lot of time because of how much content there is. I also like how application-based it is rather than just memorization.","r"
98167,"Probably not its a hard class especially with these two teachers the way the classes are taught do not correspond with whats being asked for on exams. This year some people did amazing i can guess its bc of the multiple choice and true/false questions that im sure are just bread and butter for alot of the amazing standardized test scorers but are actually just damaging for thise with accessibility challenges with this format neurologically so that the exam score doesnt deel like a fair reflection of the work youve put in. They have no business being as harsh with their grading and the difficulty of the problem sets and exams.","dr"
98167,"This class is a great introduction to Macroeconomics and I would definitely recommend to another student. The course was well-organized and many of the lectures incorporated information related to the present day. For instance, we learned about financial institutions such as banks during the time in the economy where banks collapsed. We were able to understand every day news, both in the U.S. and abroad. It is a great way to be exposed to the way the economy works in the U.S. and on a national stage.","r"
98167,"I would if they are interested in the global view of economics.","r"
98167,"Yes. It is a fun class which gives real life insights","r"
98167,"Yes. It provides good foundation.","r"
98167,"The class is excellently structured and deserves its plaudits. William Hawkins is the man.","r"
98167,"Yes! Even if you are not Econ/EPE/Global, it's good information to know. Plus, it's fun to be in a big class and often entertaining.","r"
98167,"Yes. Good professor, exams can be tough but fair","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course to any student seeking to learn more about the economy, even if they are not an economics major. I think that the knowledge I gained in this course is going to prove useful to me no matter what professional field I pursue because at the end of the day knowing what the economy is and how it works is extremely important. I would advise students not to be overly concerned if they feel that they are not able to understand everything right away during lecture. A lot of material is covered during each lecture, and it is not designed for you to get it right away. While students should not be discouraged by this, they should make an effort to review lecture slides and their notes after class during that week as opposed to waiting until the midterms and final exam. You may find yourself overwhelmed by the amount of material if you do not pace your learning/studying.","r"
98167,"most ppl only take it if they have to","neu"
98167,"It is an essential class, to start macroeconomics.","neu"
98167,"Yes, very insightful lecuteres","r"
98167,"I would recommend this course as it is an important skill for people to grasp for the real world.","r"
98167,"make sure to go over the lecture slides and notes after each class. Talk to your classmates about the materials and probelm sets.","neu"
98167,"Yes because I think the course gives a good general background of the US economy.","r"
98167,"If they are interested in Econ., then yes.","r"
98186,"Yes, I would. I think the course is very important if you're interested in data science, stats, or applied CS. I think the main downside this semester was prof Altonji being less than engaging.","r"
98186,"It's a required class for econ. If you want to learn more R, you should probably take more R classes at Yale (especially for research).","neu"
98186,"I would not. The material became very boring and it did not feel well taught.","dr"
98186,"You have to take it to be an econ major","neu"
98186,"If youre pursuing econ, yes. Dont take as a QR.","r"
98186,"Only if C/D - don't take for a grade to fulfill an economic elective unless you are willing to do all the group assignments yourself","neu"
98186,"I didn't take any stats before, so you will do better if you do, but if you can concentrate you will learn the necessary stats. This is essentially a stats course based on economics. I recommend if you need the course, don't go out of your way, there are certainly other options. If you can prepare for the stats before hand great, but not the end of the world if you dive right in because it is an introductory course.","neu"
98186,"Only if absolutely necessary. Absolutely not otherwise.","dr"
98186,"Only for the Economics major","neu"
98186,"I would only recommend if it's required for your major. It would utterly confound me if someone took this for the pure joy of it. The joy was minimal.","neu"
98186,"No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. I would rather write the entire Declaration Of Independence backwards than allow one more person to take this class.","dr"
98186,"No, this course is poorly taught.","dr"
98186,"sure","r"
98186,"Only if you need to.","neu"
98186,"This is a great course for any economics major or anyone who wants to learn to use R to do data analysis.","r"
98186,"I took this course as a non-Econ major, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to other students who do not need the course. Though it does provide you with experience in market analysis, probability/statistics, and R (to a certain extent), there are definitely better ways to gain that skill. The problem sets are also incredibly long.","neu"
98186,"I would recommend this class to another student because I think learning about coding, economics, and statistics is a very rare combination to get all in one class, making it extremely valuable.","r"
98186,"Yes, Economics majors have to take this class. Be prepared to learn a lot of data analysis and statistics.","r"
98186,"Not unless you're an Econ major.","neu"
98186,"yes- however it is more self taught. theory was taught in class but a more practical approach was expected for homework and quizzes.","r"
98186,"Yes, if you're interested in economics and statistics and the data exploration of economics experiments.","r"
98186,"No, unless required. Not a well designed course","dr"
98186,"No, the professor was not good","dr"
98186,"yea its an intro course","r"
98186,"I would. Even though this class can be quite difficult, it is a very applicable class and an important one to ""bridge the gap"" between conceptual and mathematical economic skills.","r"
98186,"Not at all. Only take it if you absolutely have to for your major (shouldn't be a major requirement). Worst class I've ever taken.","dr"
98186,"Obviously people take this because it is required. However, out of the core sequence of econ classes, I probably found this one to be the most genuinely interesting. Macro and Micro are just focused on providing esoteric formulas for things we already understand intuitively in real life. But 117 actually provides pretty interesting case studies in the importance of understanding econometric methods. Even though I do not intend to do research, I am glad I got to take this course because statistics are important to have some grasp of.","r"
98186,"Sure, if you don't need it for econ major but you're interested in analysis - it's pretty good","r"
98186,"Only if you need it for your major (econ, cs-econ, etc.). Not if you want to learn about probability and statistics, there's better classes for that.","neu"
98186,"If you need it for an Economics major, yes. Otherwise take another stats course.","neu"
98186,"I would only recommend this course if you are particularly interested in statistical analysis from an economic perspective. I believe there are likely other courses that may be better suited for learning statistics and data analysis in general as this one wasn't very interesting at times and it was hard to stay engaged.","neu"
98186,"Yes, the content can sometimes be confusing but it's very useful. The tfs also do a great job of simplifying concepts.","r"
98186,"If it is a pre-requisite for a major you are considering I would recommend. As long as you study you will get a good grade as the curve is quite forgiving.","r"
98186,"Only if its required for your major","neu"
98186,"No, if you are not an Econ major trying to get past the requirements","dr"
98186,"Yes, I found that econometrics is one of the most practical and application-based econ courses I have taken at Yale. Being able to analyze data is become more important in our data-driven world.","r"
98186,"If you are taking this class, its probably required for your major. Id recommend taking it in a semester when the instructor has a relatively good rating. Although the lectures can get boring at times, I did learn useful concepts and very interesting real-world applications throughout the course. My advice is finding a way of studying that works best for you. I personally preferred listening to lecture recordings and being able to speed up or pause as I took notes, and it worked well for me.","neu"
98186,"no. do not take unless you are taking for requirement of major","dr"
98186,"No, unless it is required for the major.","dr"
98186,"Absolutely not. Prof. Altonji is a very smart economist and professor as well as a very kind and well-intentioned person. But this course was clearly below his pay grade. He often blew too quickly past the real stuff the how precisely to do something to talk about examples in which these techniques are used in the real world. His examples were very interesting, and it was very impressive to see just how many of them he had either been in close proximity to or knew someone (another famous economist, like himself) who had worked on the example he was teaching. However, when it came time to do the quizzes, problem sets, and exams, nobody knew what was going on. By the end of the course, very few people attended lecture, not because they were lazy or checked out, but because it was more useful to teach ourselves the concepts alone or in group study. Introductory econometrics are very difficult concepts to grasp, and Yale needs to put more thought into the way this course is taught. It is a notoriously awful course, and it keeps getting worse. Everyone I know who does not need this class for their major dropped it within the first few weeks. I was considering an economics major, but as someone who is not as strong quantitatively, the necessity to teach myself these really difficult concepts forced me to Credit/D/Fail the class and stop considering an economics major.","dr"
98186,"I would because stats is a very important and applicable.","r"
98186,"I would for an econ major, but not a person simply looking for a statistics class. Its not always stimulating enough.","neu"
98186,"Yes pretty good","r"
98186,"I would recommend Econ 117 to another student because I feel that I am taking a lot of critical skills from the course.","r"
98186,"Yes, because it is an econ requirement.","r"
98186,"Not a chance. Well, at least not with Altonji. If anyone in the future is considering this class or needs it for their major, I would suggest that they do their best to find an alternative. It was the least enjoyable learning experience of my life and by far the worst class I've taken at Yale. In plenty of classes that I've taken, I haven't particularly enjoyed them in the moment, but upon reflection once their over, I've recognized that I gained quite a lot from them. This is not one of those classes. While I definitely learned something, it was not remotely worth the pain that was/is ECON 117. And perhaps the worst part is that there are so many other classes that can teach you the exact same things without having to deal with this mess. So no, I wouldn't recommend this, especially not in light of the fact that there are plenty of other classes that'll teach you the same material. Take those classes.","dr"
98186,"This class was truly horrible, by far the worst I've taken in the Econ department. However, on the one hand, the skills and material are interesting and undoubtedly valuable (I'm certainly utilizing these skills in other classes, research, and in life). On the other hand, the lectures were unbelievably dull and hard to follow, and the course itself suffered from deep disorganization; P-sets, sections, and exams were very disconnected to the lectures, teaching fellows had no idea what was going on in lecture, and there were all sorts of assumptions of prior knowledge. Content wise, the class is extremely important for any econ major, but just pray you have a better teaching team.   It is important context for the reader of this feedback to know that I am a student that performed very well on both the midterm and final, so this feedback is not in any way my anger for getting a poor grade. I give this feedback out of a sincere hope that the Econ Department will fix the nightmare that was Econ 117 this semester so future students can have a better learning experience.","dr"
98186,"I would recommend a student to come in with basic knowledge of statistics, as some of the basic concepts are not well covered","neu"
98186,"No! Dont take this class you will regret it. If you want the same skills that you learn in 117, take GLBL 121.","dr"
98186,"No unless required for major","dr"
98186,"I wouldnt if I wasnt an Economics majors. Other than learning R, I didnt really pick up a lot of important tools for regressions and data analysis that I can use.","dr"
98186,"I would say take this course only if necessary for the major and look at whether the professor that is teaching it that semester is recommended or not.","neu"
98186,"I would not recommend anyone take it with Professor Altonji.","dr"
98186,"If you're an economics major, you have to take this course, although peers say you're better off doing so in the Fall, when there are more resources to assist your learning. If you're not an economics major, you'll be happier choosing an S&DS course with similar content.","neu"
98186,"Not really, unless you really love the subject matter or have to take this for the ECON major","dr"
98186,"This is an overall solid class to introduce students to the world of econometrics.","r"
98186,"Yes if it's required for your major. Otherwise, I would caution against it unless you are very interested in the topic. The material is important but can sometimes get very mathy and confusing.","neu"
98186,"Yes if you need it for major, no if youre looking to take a statistics/coding class.","r"
98186,"I would not recommend this course to another studentonly take it if it's required for your major. If you were considering taking this class to learn R, take another, better class (like S&DS 230).","dr"
98186,"Yes! A great class for those interested in economics and how to use R as a tool for better insights.","r"
98186,"I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an introduction to statistics and data analysis, especially if they have no familiarity with Rthe course is a good introduction to all of these. However, I would caution that the course requires time outside of class to review and digest the material, as it is often dense and not explained past the lecture slides.","r"
98186,"I understand there is a more rigorous econometrics sequence than this course which is more beginner friendly. I think that this is a good introduction to the methods used in econometrics and gives you a decent feel about how statistical methods are employed in economics. The workload is manageable though does require you to keep on top of things mostly.","neu"
98186,"Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in understanding social science research methods. I found this course helpful.","r"
98186,"No, I would not. For most people, it is only worth taking if required for a major.","dr"
98186,"This course is difficult and becomes very complicated very quickly. It is a requirement for the Econ major, but if you don't need it for the major I would recommend another statistics or data science course that is more focused on practical applications than theoretical ideas.","dr"
98186,"If you have to take it for your major","neu"
98186,"Maybe with a different professor but even then it was not my favorite. I'd rather have psets every week instead of massive ones twice a week and more focus on teaching R.","neu"
98186,"If you have to take this course, then you have to take this course, but I would recommend taking it with another professor than Professor Altonji.","neu"
98186,"Eeh. If it's taught by a different professor, or if they're interested enough in the material to put in the work.","neu"
98197,"Only if its a major requirement.","neu"
98197,"Only if it is a requirement or if you are interested in theoretical economics.","neu"
98197,"Yes, obviously a requirement for econ major but this class was much more enjoyable than I'd heard in the past. I think it was a function of prof","r"
98197,"If Prof. Frick is teaching and the class is recorded then yes. The class prepares you well for the exams (as long as you have the recordings to re-watch the challenging bits) and the exams are very fair. Psets are harder than exams (yet still not too bad).","r"
98197,"Yes if required","r"
98197,"yes good intermediate","r"
98197,"Absolutely- super interesting content and Mira is a gem.","r"
98197,"Yes, if you need it for your major. No if you want to take an economics elective.","neu"
98197,"Obviously, this class is a core requirement for economics and economics-adjacent majors, and most people take it for that reason, so there isnt much use recommending it. That said, I would highly recommend taking it with Professor Frick; it will make this major requirement not feel nearly as dry.","r"
98197,"Yes. If you are an econ major, you have to take this class. I took it as a freshman in her spring semester and thought this timeline was pretty doable and also ahead a bit.","r"
98197,"Yes, it is a good class about microeconomics! The class is structured and organized so well! Definitely take if Professor Frick is teaching.","r"
98197,"Yes! Mira is great at explaining things! I found this course to be very similar to intro micro (which Id taken three semesters prior)!","r"
98197,"no.","dr"
98197,"Meh. Boring but needed for econ major. You will take more intersting classes. Lots of math in the first half of this course; be familiar with derivatives and partial derivatives. I honesly would've struggled more in this class if I had not taken multivariable calc beforehand. It's not a prereq though and possible to do this class without it.","neu"
98197,"Yes. It is very useful to understand the theory behind industry machineries.","r"
98197,"Yes if you are interested in the econ major otherwise there is no need","r"
98197,"Absolutely if youre interested in economics and want to pursue the major or a related major. Definitely take it with Mira if you can, she is superior.","r"
98197,"Yes of course. You do have to know intro micro and maybe a little bit about derivatives. But, if you are an econ major, maybe epe, or if you have taken intro micro, this course is not going to be a stress. You may find somethings harder, but other times simple, and then you might be amazed at a thing or two. If you are poli sci, I except you to take this because I don't trust people who don't know anything about optimization.","r"
98197,"Absolutely yes. Especially if Mira is the teacher. This class is important for several majors, but I genuinely think the material is interesting. This class opens the door for so many awesome classes to. I will warn you, psets are long. Some are a little hard. But you have two weeks: don't procrastinate. Unlike previous years exams ( they were available so we could practice for the final), the exams in this course were very fair.","r"
98197,"Yes. Go to section, go to office hours, and study.","r"
98197,"I am biased as an economics major, but yes to anyone who had taken an intro economics course and was interested in exploring the mathematical aspects of the economics they had learnt. I do believe coming out the course and looking back on everything taught, it is very satisfying I do hope that following-courses utilize these concepts however, as I do think some ideas are very easily forgotten if not needed. But otherwise, I would recommend one try the intro courses and one elective (such as ECON 159) first before taking ECON 121.","r"
98197,"If you have to take it, take it. Don't take it for fun.","neu"
98197,"YES TAKE IT WITH PROF MIRA FRICK. She made econ super clear to me. I was nervous entering this course because I heard from upperclassmen that it's one of the toughest econ courses, but I was able to slowly kinda figure it out. Workload is reasonable, pset questions are helpful if a bit tedious at times but it's definitely manageable, and the exam questions are very straightforward and you know what to expect. I'm glad I took this course, especially with Prof Frick.","r"
98197,"No. Dont do it.","dr"
98197,"I'd only take this class if: you're an Econ major OR you love applied math. I am not an economics or Econ-adjacent major and I greatly prefer proof-based maths to the application of derivatives, so I did not enjoy this course. There is very little economic content: it's mostly just doing a bunch of optimization problems with Lagrangians. If that's your thing, take this class; otherwise, think carefully before enrolling.","neu"
98197,"No, I did not learn anything that is applicable outside of the course. Take Econ 159 instead.","dr"
98197,"Of course! Micro can be tough but Prof Frick is a fantastic professor.","r"
98197,"Yes, because I think understanding the math behind concepts learned in Intro Microeconomics is necessary.","r"
98197,"I would only recommend this course if it is required for your major.","neu"
98197,"If they need the class, yes, but otherwise, no.","neu"
98197,"I would recommend this class if you have to take it for a major requirementespecially if Mira is teaching. I would say consider taking this class if you're interested in microeconomics (and a deeper level of math than what is taught at the introductory level).","r"
98197,"Only if it is a requirement or if they are very good at mathematics.","neu"
98197,"yeah if you gotta take it for your major or are interested in microeconomics","r"
98197,"I would recommend this course, especially if you are a part of the major.","r"
98197,"If you have to, take it.","neu"
98197,"Yes, if you need to take the course. It is not the most interesting because it is trying to get through so much material. Lectures mostly consist of the professor reading off the slide presentations, so engagement is not high. The professor is comprehensive with review sessions and materials before the exams however and the material that appeared on the exams was very similar to the study material. It is a lot of material split between only two exams so be prepared for more extensive studying and preparation than in previous economics courses.","r"
98197,"Yes","r"
98197,"Yes, I would recommend this course to other students interested in taking micro to the next level. I think that it definitely lacks math though compared to the 125.","r"
98197,"Yes, if they enjoy math and economics.","r"
98197,"I would recommend it if it's required for you (either as a major or pre-req for other classes). Otherwise, it is not much more useful than what you would gain from intro micro.","r"
98197,"I would definitely recommend this course to other students as it is very well taught and the concepts have a real-world impact.","r"
98197,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The class was organized to facilitate student learning, all of the resources we needed were provided, and I learned so much!","r"
98197,"Not unless you have to take.","dr"
98197,"Yes very important just for economic well readness","r"
98197,"probably a prerequisite","neu"
98197,"Yes if they are interested in the material","r"
98197,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone trying to gain a fundamental knowledge for microeconomic theory. In general, I would suggest skipping past introductory microeconomics if you are comfortable with mathematical rigor, as this course covers pretty much the same ideas.","r"
98208,"You are probably here because you're required to take this course and/or intermediate micro. I have not taken intermediate micro so I cannot compare the two.","neu"
98208,"Yes","r"
98208,"Only if required for their major","neu"
98208,"As a student who only took the class because of the Global Affairs requirement, I was very pleased with how much I learned from the course and the real world implications that can be drawn from what initially appears to be abstract theory. It is a smooth progression from the introductory class, though it does not fit well in the Global major. I would recommend the course, especially with the current instructor.","r"
98208,"Yes, if you are interested in international relations, trade and economics","r"
98208,"I would recommend this course to others. It is a major requirement for a few majors and not too much work. The problem sets can be knocked out in just 2-4 hours, which isn't too bad, especially if you work with friends. Furthermore, this class felt far more applicable than micro because the models felt more tangible and concrete. The math isn't bad at all, as well.","r"
98208,"Not if you don't need to take it, but if it's required for your major, don't stress.","dr"
98208,"Very interesting content, but only really take the course if you have high interest in macroeconomics or for requirement","neu"
98208,"core class","neu"
98208,"Yes. Of the Econ sequence, this class seems the most practical and important in understanding macroeconomic trends and markets.","r"
98208,"I would.","r"
98208,"I think the course is a good course for those who need it for a major requirement and is taught well for that but I don't see its application outside of that","neu"
98208,"This is an incredibly useful class. Anyone who wants to understand what is going on in the news and with the government currently should take this class. This gives you a solid understanding of inflation, interest rates, growth, government debt, etc. all extremely topical.","r"
98208,"I would only if you are either an Economics major or highly interested in applications to the real world.","neu"
98208,"yes it was good","r"
98208,"This course teaches valuable concepts that can be applied to real-world economic scenarios, so anybody with literally any interest in economics, especially macroeconomics, should take this course. That said, students should prepare to do involved mathematical derivations for numerous models throughout the course.","r"
98208,"If you're an Econ major and you need to take it, it's not bad, but it can be difficult to remain engaged during lectures.","neu"
98208,"If interested in economics definitely. Unlike some other econ classes here, the content is highly relevant and you're forced to understand the economic intuition behind real events like the great recession and COVID-19 pandemic.","r"
98208,"Yes! Much more than intermediate micro. I think these models are truly beneficial to future understanding. I came into these courses expecting to like micro more, but I think macro was covered in such a way that increased my understanding and intrigue for the ideas.","r"
98208,"Yes - if it is required for your major. Content was very specific to the econ major so if you're just generally interested in macro maybe ECON 116 is a better option.","r"
98208,"Yes! Great way to understand different macroeconomic indicators at a high level.","r"
98208,"I would recommend this class to all students, especially if Professor Lindenlaub is teaching. I stayed engaged with the material to the end of the semester, and felt like I was learning crucial ways of thinking about current economic issues.","r"
98208,"Yes - it's a good idea to understand the economic models taught in this class, and I enjoyed learning how these models can be applied. I didn't think it was easier than intermediate micro though - there are many derivations and you need good economic intutition.","r"
98208,"If you can choose between this course and ECON 121, I would highly recommend 121 instead of this - but if you have to take this course, it is fine. The models we discuss feel contrived and not remotely applicable to real-world, but that's the nature of the class. There was too much of a focus on the mathematical derivations of models (which feels more appropriate for ECON 126), and the problem sets are annoyingly long, but the slides are helpful and the exams are fair.","dr"
98208,"Yes, get to learn about macroeconomics in more depth which helps understand how the real world economy operates.","r"
98208,"With the same professor, I would recommend it. She was very adaptable and made the class very interesting.","r"
98208,"Yes - a pretty solid course overall, I would recommend it even if it wasn't a major requirement.","r"
98208,"If you need to fill an intermediate level, I understand macro and Fed information is more interesting - I like it too - but micro was also interesting and a better structure. This course gave a few headaches with the unreasonable math and curveballs that did not correlate with our lectures, or they were thrown in for fun, her psets were also too long for weekly deadlines.","dr"
98208,"Yes! If you are an econ major, you obviously have to take this class (or macro theory), but I honestly would recommend it to anyone who meets the prerqs. The material is extremely interesting, and while it was challenging at times, I definitely walked away from this class with a much better understanding of the economy.","r"
98208,"As a required course, it's not bad. I think the content is actually quite interesting. Lecturer and lectures were good. The Psets can be interesting. The textbook is a useful supplement for class, and luckily the syllabus lists corresponding textbook chapters.","neu"
98208,"Yes, if they are looking to get a more nuanced understanding of the basic macroeconomic theories and concepts along with their mathematical applications and derivations.","r"
98208,"Only if required for your major. Intro Macro would suffice if someone is interested in Macro.","neu"
98208,"Yes, it allows you to better understand the interaction between consumers, government and monetary policy.","r"
98208,"I think for a student seeking to fulfill the intermediate economics requirement of the Global Affairs major as it is fairly grounded in policy compared to the alternatives. That said, outside that context I would not recommend this course because it spends too long on models that have little relevance outside of academia.","neu"
98208,"Yes, even if you arent required to, you learn some cool models about real world phenomena. The content feels applicable and youll learn a lot about the economic background behind some recent world events.","r"
98208,"I would recommend. This is a necessary course to understand government policy and economics as a whole. Also professor lindenlaub is amazing.","r"
98208,"Generally a requirement, honestly would encourage others to possibly consider 126 (and be thoughtful about which is a better choice); 122 gives an overview to macroeconomics with generally understandable models. The models can quickly lose the simplicity that makes them so powerful, and the problem sets can often quickly become dense and calculation-heavy. Still a good course with lots of caring and engaged TAs","neu"
98208,"Yes, it is definitely a necessary class for economics majors, preparing the students well for modelling skills and thought procedures, as well as for the overall understanding of the field","r"
98208,"Its a requirement","neu"
98208,"If a student is an Economics major than they must take this class. The material at times didn't feel that interesting but could be necessary if you were interested in Central Banking. I probably wouldn't have taken this class if I was not an Economics major.","neu"
98208,"I would not recommend this course to anyone who doesn't HAVE to take intermediate macroeconomics, but the reason this course is bad is because of its curriculum and not Lindenlaub. She is a great lecturer, is really good at tying the theory to applications, has super clear slides, and the class is organized very well. Unfortunately, the material in this class is difficult and often frustrating to study. The economic models we learn about are very math-y for no reason and literally summarize the entire economy into one variable; I don't think my understanding of economics improved that much over the semester, although my understanding of how an economy of two people and one good can be modeled by math did. Overall, the content of the class is not great but taking it with Lindenlaub will make it better.","dr"
98208,"If you have to, or as a prerequisite. As an intermediate economics class, it's not the most enjoyable, but it certainly is useful as you progress through your major or other prerequisites.","neu"
98208,"Yes, a great introduction to understanding economic modeling and policy decisions.","r"
98208,"yes","r"
98208,"Yes! With prof Lindenlaub","r"
98208,"Yes, its a requirement of the econ major and also more enjoyable than intermediate macro. If you can take it with Prof Lindenlaub you should!","r"
98208,"Yes, it is a great way to learn more about fundamental economic concepts, theoretical and applied.","r"
98208,"Yes, if you want to pursue economics further.","r"
98208,"If you're an Econ major, you have to take it If you're Global, I would consider ECON 121 (less math)","neu"
98208,"This is a fantastic course: Ilse's lectures (particularly the ""whiteboard"" breaks) are fantastic, the teaching team is excellent, and the problem sets and exams are interesting and fair.","r"
98208,"Yes if you're interested/have to take macro, it's a good overview, though personally feel like it doesnt add that much beyond intro macro except for the math behind things - wish lectures could have been made more engaging","r"
98208,"Yes if they are an Econ major","r"
98208,"Yes very good course to help with critical thinking skills.","r"
98208,"If you need it for your major.","neu"
98208,"I would. It is required for the Econ major, and the material is relevant across the economics curriculum.","r"
98208,"One of the most relevant economic courses to understand what is going on in the world.","r"
98208,"Econ major requirement.","neu"
98208,"Yes, I would recommend this course because it helps you understand the equilibrium on a deeper level.","r"
98208,"yup gotta understand macro","r"
98208,"Yes- it is important to understand the macroeconomy. The material in this course is challenging but I felt like the TF's and Professor Lindenlaub really cared about us and our learning, which I appreciated. I would recommend going into it realizing that each Pset will be challenging, but you'll leave with some valuable insights and a feeling of accomplishment at the end.","r"
98208,"Yes, for an economics major or other major requiring the course. Not the best at instilling intuition, so hard to find greater benefits beyond that.","r"
98208,"Yes! Most people are in this class because it was a requirement (including myself), but I really enjoyed this class. The lectures are interesting and engaging, and I felt like I understood the world better after taking this class.","r"
98208,"I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to gain an understanding of how economics is connected to virtually every other subject.","r"
98225,"Yes. Good mix of theory and practice. Will definitely learn a lot about regression","r"
98225,"Yes, I learned a lot","r"
98225,"yes it is pretty intreseting","r"
98225,"Yes, if your major requires it","r"
98225,"Unless you are a Econ-Math major who already knows everything about Econometrics and lacks a capacity for human empathy, do not take this class. I completed the course in part because I felt a deep responsibility to warn those thinking about taking ECON 136 in the future. I am a martyr and you're all welcome for my sacrifice. As all econ classes are, this one is graded on a curve. There are only about 25 students taking the class and they're all uber-smart gunners who would probably be willing to kill a family member for an A. I feel justified in saying this because several students consistently displayed rude behavior and even purposefully distracted others during lecture and tests to gain a competitive advantage.   On top of this, most of them seem to already know the subject before even starting the courseI say this because some would never come to class and there was absolutely no class material posted outside of the lectures. There was no other way they could've learned the material. Despite being the equivalent of a 200-300's level math class, your transcript will show that you took a 100 level econ course (likely with a poor grade) as your reward for all the pain and suffering.   But maybe you're just a smart little robot who derives pleasure from crushing everyone else's hopes and dreamsin that case this class is for you.","dr"
98225,"If you are interested in gaining an in-depth knowledge of econometrics and the theory behind it, then I would recommend this course. Otherwise, this class will be very dry and possibly overwhelming as it is very easy to feel like you're falling behind.","neu"
98225,"If it is a requirement, else avoid","neu"
98225,"Great course with Min","r"
98225,"Take it with a good professor if you can. The instructor really matters for a course like this. If you have a dry lecturer, the classes just drag on and on. If you have an inspiring lecturer, you'll be motivated and excited to learn.","neu"
98225,"Yes. Went into this class thinking it was gonna be a drag, but honestly it was very enjoyable. Essential for anyone who is doing economics-y stuff and is looking to go into a quantitative field. The class gives you a solid theoretical understanding of basic linear regressions, as well as the practical skills to read papers and implement methods yourself. Being good at math and having seen a proof before certainly helps, but in terms of specific background you don't really need much save for basic stats (S&DS 242 type stuff), a class in linear algebra, and the ability to take a derivative.","r"
98225,"Absolutely, tough and engaging but Bjoern and Min were incredible, and the content is actually quite interesting and applicable; just be mindful and patient with a steep learning curve","r"
98225,"I think if you want to get a good theoretical foundation in econometrics, it does a good job. It's also required for a lot of people. The class is very math heavy, which can be hard to get used to in the outset but I ended up adjusting by the end and it felt more doable.","r"
98225,"No, unless it's a required course for you. The professor taught it badly and the course material is very dense.","dr"
98225,"Take it if it's required","neu"
98229,"No, I was anticipating taking this class with another professor, and this prof was very sweet but just not an engaging nor digestable lecturer.","dr"
98229,"If you need a relatively low workload econ class then yes.","r"
98229,"Yes, good economics elective, interesting lectures.","r"
98229,"Yes! Great econ elective for those interested in international trade policy and the current tariff war/climate policies. Sam is a great lecturer and the workload is very manageable.","r"
98229,"Only if you're really interested in the theoretical models underpinning trade. Basically take the fundamental trade models you learn in introductory macro/microecon and scale them up to a whole semester. Again, this class doesn't teach trade policy or analysis of current trading patterns. These come mostly in the form of application of the models you learn in class.","neu"
98229,"Yes, this course is a great economics elective. The material is very applicable to current events, and it is exciting to be able to explore current trade deals and economic events with a critical lens.","r"
98229,"Yes if you want to see how econ can be applicable and are interested in international trade","r"
98229,"No, thers much better courses where you are engaged and actually learn","dr"
98229,"The course content is very interesting but the organization is poor. Workload is really low so if you feel confident in your ability to get by on your own it may be okay. If youre someone who relies on office hours, practice tests, or group work, this isnt a good choice. The prof is a bit boring and doesnt seem to have a clear plan.","neu"
98229,"I would recommend this course to students who would like to gain some understanding and familiarity with trade.","r"
98229,"No I would not, I think there may be better alternatives where you will better understand the content. Everyone including the professor seemed confused about the content.","dr"
98231,"nope didnt learn anything too useful or applicable. There was definitely interesting content though.","dr"
98231,"If they are interested in development economics, yes.","r"
98231,"yes as an interesting elective","r"
98231,"Yes, if the student has any interest in economic modeling or culturally specific social structures.","r"
98231,"Yes! Professor Munshi is a great professor and he is truly invested in the material which makes learning it even better. The topics are very interesting and this course helps develops economic intuition and skills, especially as a first economics elective.","r"
98231,"Yes, if you haven't taken a development economics class and are interested in more qualitative narrative of development. This is not a gut, this is not a gut, don't be fooled by the course ratings. You need to put in a lot of time understanding the materials.","r"
98231,"yes! especially if you are interested in the development of economies","r"
98231,"I would recommend to any student who wants to learn about development economics.","r"
98231,"Yes! Big fan of the content of this course, as well as Prof. Munshi. Good content, not too much work.","r"
98231,"Absolutely. If you engage with the class you will be able to say that this is one of the best econ electives that you've taken at Yale. The coursework is not heavy at all, the material is most interesting (albeit I do wish there was some more diversity within the topics and types of papers discussed). Hopefully with feedback, Prof Munshi can better design the course so that it poses more of an intellectual challenge and allows students to actively engage with the course more in the future.","r"
98231,"Yes, professor munshi is super great","r"
98231,"yes if you want a good step after econometrics ot understand how Econ research is actually done / how to read economics papers.  No if you want higher level policy type insights into how to do economic development ""Right"" - the class is super micro and sometimes rather abstract","r"
98231,"Absolutely. An excellent course with an excellent professor.","r"
98231,"Yeah-- I think if you're interested in Econ- especially Econ research methods, this is a good solid not to difficult course that will keep you engaged and allow you to come away with lots of valuable skills. If you are super adept at stats already, it will probably feel very slow.","r"
98231,"Highly recommend!","r"
98231,"Yes. I was able to approach economics through a sociological lens, which I had not been able to do before at Yale. I underestimated the importance of biology and social institutions for how our world develops, and it's interesting to look at economics as an evolving story of different societies and peoples.","r"
98231,"Yes, this was my first econ class that exposed me to reading research papers and that's a pretty useful skill even if you don't plan on going further in economics research","r"
98231,"YES! This is a great course with very interesting content (economic development Asia, but the principles can be used in different developing countries) with low workload. Majority of your grade is determined by two exams which are difficult to study for, but if you have a good math/stats foundation, you will be fine. Prof Munshi is VERY passionate about the subject and he's done a lot of research of his own. The psets could feel little disconnected to the lecture content and it's hard to study the exams just off of psets.","r"
98231,"No, this course is at its fundamental level purely about economic development in India as told by 16 papers that we studied and their models, that's it. Please don't think this course is a gut or about any economic developmental theory or anything like that, it's not fun and I regret taking this course. Just don't take it, take something you're interested in. If you're interested in economic development just read a book or watch a youtube video, don't take this class. All that said, the course material was boring BUT Munshi is actually a really good professor, he teaches well, explains things well, makes complicated things look simple, and cares about his students.","dr"
98231,"Yes, it teaches you how to think like an economist.","r"
98259,"If you are looking for an easy humanities gut, stay away! This is not an easy Hu course and heavily focused on the theory and politics of education studies. There are only 3 papers and the grading is relatively rough. Readings are sooo much, hard to keep up.","dr"
98259,"i would recommend this course to everyone, people should know this stuff and stanley is funny.","r"
98259,"No. While people who major in Philosophy might be able to get something of value out of this course, as an Ed Studies person, I found it to be very boring. and while I think there's potential in the course by connecting Philosopher's perspectives on education and actual education practices, it is simply lacking in any scope besides philosophy.","dr"
98259,"Yes absolutely! Prof. Stanley is excellent at making philosophy easily understood. He brings in relevant examples that help you understand the material.","r"
98259,"Yes!","r"
98259,"Yes! If you're genuinely interested in the different philosophies of education and how they've evolved over time, take it!","r"
98259,"I would recommend this course to another student. The Professor offers very engaging, rigorous lectures that clarify and expand upon the course readings and materials. I particularly enjoyed the wide array of scholarship that we studied, including Black Feminist Theorists/Critical Race Theorists, European Philosophers, etc.. I also appreciated the wide latitude that we were given in the essays, as offering multiple prompts ensured that I could write on a topic that resonated with me. Professor Stanley really created an inclusive educational atmosphere, he was very accessible and communicative, and charismatic.","r"
98259,"Yes","r"
98259,"Absolutely. Everyone in every major should take. Great leminar. Stanley rocks.","r"
98259,"If your interest is in US politics of education then yes. If you are interested in a more general / international perspective on philosophy of education en education studies then no.","neu"
98259,"Yes, I would because it is very interdisciplinary and could be tailored to your own interests. There is so much flexibility with our assignments that you can make it interesting for yourself. I also think that in terms of the philosophy we read and engage with is so much more interesting and useful than other philosophy offerings.","r"
98259,"I definitely would, the topics were interesting in general even for people without strong philosophy interests or backgrounds.","r"
98259,"If students thrive in an unstructured learning environment, I would recommend this course to them. The course moves quickly and Professor Stanley is fun to watch, but his disorganization, sarcasm, and interrupting made it difficult for me to enjoy the course. However, for someone who likes spontaneous, comical professors, I would recommend this course.","neu"
98260,"If you are interested in the topic, then yes, even if you aren't a psychology major. The workload is manageable and the lectures are engaging if you have an interest.","r"
98260,"yes","r"
98260,"I took this course as a requirement for my major (Psychology) and would probably not recommend taking it out of personal interest.","dr"
98260,"Yes, for someone interested in psychology, this course covered some very interesting topics and definitely wasn't too hard.","r"
98260,"If you need to take this course for a required class, I encourage it! It is definitely one of the better if not only choices for completing the social science core requirement and I feel like I learned a lot. It's not a gut, but you don't have to worry about readings or anything because the professor doesn't really put surprise questions and assignments based on readings out.","r"
98260,"No. This class isn't very engaging, and I don't think it was set up very well to teach about social psych. It's not a bad class, it's just very average.","dr"
98260,"Yes","r"
98260,"I would. If you have already taken some psych courses this can be a bit repetitive. I do think thats the nature of a lot of psych courses however and I felt like I did get the chance to learn about the same topics but in a different way and get to apply it to other topics that I hadn't already heard about.","r"
98260,"In general yes, I learned a lot and had a positive experience with the course. In the context of some of the other psych classes offered, however, I would probably not recommend it- I have found other classes a lot more engaging just because of the lecture style/activities (unrelated to content)","r"
98260,"yes! I love social psychology","r"
98260,"I would recommend this class because it has interesting material. You can better understand the world and other people which is always good.","r"
98260,"I would recommend the class if you need to take it for the psychology major, but it wasn't a class that I would just take for fun even though I am really interested in psychology. I think you would have gotten the same knowledge by reading the textbook chapters from the syllabus, as the class was interactive.","r"
98260,"Yes, its a good survey lecture.","r"
98260,"Social psych is an interesting class","r"
98260,"Yes, I think this course was a very important fundamental to psychology and it was enjoyable.","r"
98260,"It is a good baseline psychology course for those curious about what they want to major in and thinking that they are interested in psychology.","r"
98260,"Yes. Its similar to intro psych but goes more in depth on interactions and relationships. I liked it and thought it was interesting.","r"
98260,"Yes, its a very great intro-level psychology class. Class is well organized and concepts are pretty easy to grasp.","r"
98260,"I would recommend this course.","r"
98260,"Yes, I would recommend this course to students of any major. This is because it provides better understanding into our own relationships, not only with others, but also with our selves - a skill which everyone can benefit from.","r"
98260,"If you're interested in picking up key social psychology concepts, I would recommend this course. I don't however think it's the most fun course at Yale, so if you're looking for something more along those lines, I would not recommend.","neu"
98260,"Yes the topics are interesting","r"
98260,"only if theyre interested in social psych","neu"
98260,"Yes, I found the material very interesting.","r"
98260,"Absolutely! This is one of those classes I think everyone would benefit from taking, because its very insightful.","r"
98260,"Yes if they want to learn about social psychology.","r"
98260,"Yes; I feel confident that I will retain the interesting information that I learned","r"
98260,"If you are looking for a social science credit, this is a good class to take.","r"
98085,"Definitely, if you're interested in fossils/dinosaurs/evolution!","r"
98085,"yes if you have a friend that can teach you about phylogeny.","r"
98085,"yes but just be prepared to put in a lot of work studying for the exam portions. definitely not a gut","r"
98085,"Yes it's a good class for non-stem majors.","r"
98085,"No; though the workload is low, I would not recommend. The lectures spill out so much information but it is hard to understand what is actually important when there aren't psets and homework that guide the understanding. If you are not passionate about rocks and fossils, do not take.","dr"
98085,"No, I would never recommend this course to another student, even if they were really interested and already well informed in the subject matter, if only because the final is worth 46% of the grade.   If the final were changed to a more reasonable percentage, I would still be reluctant to recommend another student take this class. I don't feel I learned much in it, yet at the same time, was constantly challenged by it.","dr"
98085,"Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to understand more about life. Though it can get very jargony and technical at times, it has helped me so much to understand evolution. I took this as my biology credit for EVST BS, and im so thankful I did.","r"
98085,"I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in developing a fundamental understanding of the history of life on Earth.","r"
98085,"I wouldn't reccomend it if you are not interested in the fossil record or phylogeny and stuff like that. It was difficult to find motivation to go to classes because it was all the way in the Kline Geology lab, and for some reason in the second and third sections of the lecture they did not record.","dr"
98085,"Yes! I took this course to fulfill a requirement, but ended up enjoying the course as much as any other at Yale. If you are interested in the topics, the lectures are very cool and engaging, and the workload is manageable without feeling onerous.","r"
98085,"No, it is not a gut. Would not recommend if not required.","dr"
98085,"I would recommend this course to those interested in science, even if not on the E&EB or EVST track. It is general enough that those not specialized in a particular science will understand and appreciate the course. But that is not to say that it is an easy or boring class, it is an extremely interesting class that is well fit for those intending on majoring in the subject and those not.","r"
98085,"I would definitely recommend this course to another EVST major interested in evolution or ecology. I feel like I have a much deeper understanding of the world around me after taking this course!","r"
98085,"Yes! Absolutely- this course is adaptive and engaging across the three different instructors, and the Professors are not only incredible for their vast amounts of knowledge, but also their bright personalities and desire to see students learn. This course was a great introduction to EPS and facilitates understanding, even for non-majors, providing a great introduction to evolutionary patterns and phenomena. You also get to witness and touch incredible fossils!","r"
98097,"YES! This was such an incredible course. I would recommend this to absolutely anyone, but especially to fellow humanities majors looking for a science credit. In addition to the basic concepts one would expect from a bird class (anatomy, etc.) this course engages with concepts of beauty, sexual autonomy, scientific debates, and more. It is so much more than just a class on birds, and Professor Prum is a truly brilliant professor who is so passionate about teaching and his work. I also found this class to be quite easy, and if you attend lecture and study just a little bit you will be successful. I have so many friends who have taken random classes for their science credits and hated them, and I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to take this one. Prum only teaches it every other year, so take it when you can!","r"
98097,"Yes!! Birds!!","r"
98097,"Yes, its a fascinating course where I learnt a lot. Its not really applicable to anything I want to do in life but it was a great course to take for the fun of learning.","r"
98097,"Yes! If you want a fun science credit, are interested in evolution, or think birds are cool, take the class! I went in blind and it ended up being my favorite class this semester! Low stress and you learn lots of cool bird facts!","r"
98097,"Please take ornithology! I am not an E&EB major, and ornithology is one of the top three classes I have ever taken at Yale. I think many of the classes I have taken at Yale, although excellent, have made me aware of a wide variety of problems with which I was previously unfamiliar. This is great but also does not necessarily make me a happier person. Ornithology, in contrast, instilled in me a genuine sense of wonder about the world again. I loved learning about birds--their beauty, song, etc.--and I was taken by how ornithology is so cross-cutting. For example, Prum wrote an article about lame duck presidents.","r"
98097,"Yes! This class was super enjoyable and fascinating at every turn. As long as you show up to class, spend a day studying before the test, and start your final paper well in advance, it doesn't turn out to be a whole lot of work, and not too difficult to do well in. Super glad to have been able to take the class -- probably one of the finest lecture classes at Yale","r"
98097,"I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is at least curious about birds.","r"
98097,"Would recommend to anyone who feels passionate about birds, or want to learn more about the diversity of life in general.","r"
98097,"Absolutely, but only if you are already interested in birds or biology. If not, there may be moments in which the material is frustratingly niche","r"
98097,"Yes, this is not a gut science course, but you become a bird expert by the end of the course. Professor Prum is also an amazing professor and it is great to see how passionate he is about ornithology.","r"
98097,"If youre taking this for a gut science credit, DONT. He says this is not a gut at the very beginning. And its true. It is not. There is a lot of memorization and a lot of details to know. If youre passionate about birds or not, you will learn a lot. But even if the workload seems low, trust that this class will have you memorize a lot for the exams. Repeat, this is not a gut.","dr"
98097,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! The contentbirdsis awesome. The format is approachable. The workload (especially if you are only in the lecture class) is manageable. I highly recommend taking the lab as it makes lecture content much easier to process and can be very helpful on exams. Professor Prum is a prominent ornithologist in the field who basically discovered or worked on almost all of the content in the course. It is the opportunity of a lifetime.","r"
98097,"I would highly, highly recommend this course. While I am an art history major (was mainly trying to get my SC out of the way), this class changed the way I look at the world, art, birds, beauty, and my role in all those things. There was so much value in going really deep into the study of one clade/genus/species and yet getting perspective on a world so much larger than the specific topic. I loved this class so much and I'm telling all my friends to take it if it's the last thing they do at Yale. TAKE IT!!!!!","r"
98097,"Yes, Prof Prum is very passionate about what he's teaching and the lectures have always been very engaging and insightful","r"
98097,"I absolutely recommend this course to any other student. Birds are one of defining features of the environment around us, and this class will greatly enhance your appreciation of them.","r"
98097,"I would recommend this course to another student with the warning that it will be a full 1-credit workload, and nothing less should be expected.","r"
98097,"The class is quite interesting even if one doesn't have any background in ornithology or previous interest. The content is very broad, and tests require a lot of review beforehand to cover all the material presented in class. Still, for a humanities major, the information is understandable without previous science courses. I would recommend the course if one is willing to engage during lectures and outside of class. The workload is manageable if you don't procrastinate on the final paper.","r"
98097,"Yes, its a great course.","r"
98097,"Absolutely. It was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Ornithology stands out especially among science classes for being interesting and relevant to my own life. I learned a lot about birds that really expanded my knowledge of avian biology and diversity, but the units on behavior, intelligence, and sexual selection changed how I see the world and approach biology.","r"
98292,"I would if theyre willing to put in a lot of work for a good grade. This class definitely isnt easy and if you dont like programming that much its going to make you cry. However, Professor Bennett is a really great teacher and I felt like I learned a lot through the course.","r"
98292,"Yes, it is a lot of work but it was a good course.","r"
98292,"Yes this is probably the best introduction to programming offered at Yale.","r"
98292,"Yes. Professor Bennett is awesome! Her slides and Canvas site are very well-organized. It is easy to find everything you need. There are ample extra help opportunities too. If you want to learn C, C++, and have an introduction to MATLAB, this is the perfect course!","r"
98292,"If you want to take a programming class go for it","r"
98292,"Yes, but be careful if you're a beginner to coding as this class is not as welcoming to that.","r"
98292,"if you want to learn general coding that solves problems sure","neu"
98292,"yes, its so well taught and prof beth anne bennett is the best","r"
98292,"I think that other coding classes would teach languages that are more applicable for everyday use, but as this course is required for many engineering majors, I recommend it for anybody in engineering, even if it isnt a requirement for ones specific discipline.","neu"
98292,"Yes ! Especially if taught with Dr Bennett.","r"
98292,"Yes, if you want to learn coding and you are prepared to put in the time and effort. Professor Bennett is amazing, and there are a lot of office hours/help sessions.","r"
98292,"Yes 100%. The content and PSETS are great, media is organized incredibly well, and Beth Anne Bennett was a wonderful professor.","r"
98292,"Absolutely, it was super well organized and well taught and I learned a really interesting useful skill. The matlab part of the course was annoying but the rest of it was great.","r"
98292,"I would recommend this course to other students pursuing a science or engineering degree because it gives you a good foundation in languages. While the problem sets and midterms were very challenging, it was possible to receive help very quickly.","r"
98292,"I would recommend this course as it is a great introduction to c and c++ with some basic skills taught in Matlab. It covers a wide base so you learn a lot. It is certainly easier with some prior experience however if you spend time on each problem set learning you will end up with a respectable grade regardless.","r"
98292,"Highly reccomend","r"
98292,"Yes. Great into to coding and Professor Bennett was a great professor.","r"
98292,"I would recommend if youre an engineer or want to learn applications of computer science.","r"
98292,"Definitely take this course if you want to learn C and C++.","r"
98292,"Yes! Programming skills are important in the real world, and even if not going into engineering or computer science, it's a fun course with an amazing teacher.","r"
98292,"I would recommend as an intro to programming course","r"
98354,"Yes! This was one of my favorite classes this semester! Professor Grund is a gem and makes learning so engaging, from the occasional fun facts to in-depth answers to any and every student question. The assignments are built to help you develop skills throughout the semester, and Professor Grund is incredibly helpful throughout the process. You also receive detailed feedback on each assignment so you know where you can improve.","r"
98354,"If they're interested in learning about the history of English or have an interest in linguistics, absolutely. It was quite a bit of work I consistently had a large assignment due, and the readings were often paired with additional exercises that meant that I invested a lot of time into this class.","r"
98354,"Yes! Good medieval rec and good environment. Can feel like a lot at first but really you have all the tools and support to succeed and it can feel rewarding and Peter grund responds to emails very quickly","r"
98354,"Yes!! It's such a unique, interesting course. Definitely not easy, but you'll get so much out of it if you put in the time and work.","r"
98354,"I would, but only if you're willing to get into linguistic weeds!","r"
98354,"Yes! Especially for English majors looking to fulfill historical requirements","r"
98354,"If you are interested at all in the English language (or need a Medieval credit) then definitely!","r"
98354,"This is a great way to get any of your major requirements, and Professor Grund is great! I think I would advise taking this only if you have an interest in linguistics- word construction and language properties rather than literature. This isnt a literature course but it is really interesting!! I enjoyed it a lot.","r"
98354,"YES! I learned so much and truly reframed my understanding of the sociopolitical consequences of English.","r"
98354,"This course is a good way to fulfill the Medieval requirement for the English major. It is an interesting, niche class and I feel like I have left this semester with a lot of knowledge and context regarding the English language. Students should be aware of the high workload within the class and the challenging nature of the text analyses/assignments. With practice, the assignments will become less challenging but the first few were more challenging as they have a different format that most of the assignments in other English classes.","r"
98354,"Yes! I learned so much, and Professor Grund was amazing.","r"
98354,"Definitely! I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in how English evolved into the language we speak today and who is interested in issues of linguistic justice. This is much more a linguistics class than an English literature class, so I would warn a student who thought this was a literary survey course away from this class. The course summary on YCS said that we would work with authors such as Milton, Shakespeare, Austen, and Cardi B, but really we just worked from textbooks.","r"
98354,"One thing to know is that the class is too big to be a discussion-based seminar, but too small to be a pure lecture, so the class ends up functioning and feeling like a high school class. A good medieval credit for the English major.","r"
98368,"If you don't enjoy reading and writing, I wouldn't take this class. Other than that I highly recommend it. It's very insightful and has so many interesting takeaways (fire and water are media, etc)","dr"
98368,"If you come into the class with an open mind and a desire to learn about media ---you'll love it.","r"
98368,"Yes, it is definitely a lot of writing but I enjoyed the course and the course's content overall.","r"
98368,"I would highly recommend this course to another student. The material is fun and engaging to the extent that you embrace thinking outside of the box. The professor is very funny and makes the course enjoyable as well. The writing assignments are very creative and engaging, and you receive great feedback from your teaching fellow.","r"
98368,"ABSOLUTELY! You'll learn from one of Yale'sand the world'sgreatest professors about fascinating topics. Your mind will expand with every lecture. You'll get to engage with fascinating course materials. And your wonderful TF will guide you through everything and work with you to make you a more articulate thinker.","r"
98368,"Yes! I loved both the professor and the teaching fellow and I learned a lot more about media as a whole.","r"
98368,"I would! I think the media-mindset taught is valuable, and John Peters is just a pleasure to listen to.","r"
98368,"I would definitely recommend this course, as the professor was one of the most engaging and interesting professors that I have had.","r"
98368,"No, I think I would have appreciated more guidance about the expectations for understanding on the lectures. My TA was excellent but I heard some of them were not. I also, despite recognizing that this course was intellectually stimulating, do not see how I could really apply anything media studies related to actual life situations or career activities.","dr"
98368,"Yes, simply because it taught me how to think and analyze media.","r"
98368,"Great course!!!","r"
98368,"Yes if you want to have some fun and think about media in a new way.","r"
98368,"A deconstructing class and redefining what medias can be","neu"
98368,"Yes, but you can only really make the best of it if you do the readings and attend the lectures (which are very interesting and we sometimes even clap at the end). I wouldnt take this if youre only looking for a writing credit.","r"
98368,"yes good writing credit","r"
98368,"Yes","r"
98368,"Absolutely. Even though its a required course, I would take it regardless. Peters is a fantastic professor.","r"
98368,"Yes I would as it is a great introduction into media studies and helps highlight its significance in many aspects of the human experience.","r"
98368,"Yessss. Changed my life and it is crucial for any aspiring artist","r"
98368,"Yes! It was a really interesting class.","r"
98368,"Yes. Prof Peters provides insight which i found quite interesting.","r"
98368,"YES! YES! YES! A hundred times over. Professor Peters made this course wonderful, and one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. Each lecture was fascinating, and felt like a mixture of a ted talk, a podcast, and a little adventure, all at once. This class makes you think about media in non-traditional ways, and I feel like I see the world around me completely differently now. The readings are all fascinating and entertaining. My TF was amazing, and I have heard great things about all of them. But, again, Professor Peters is what truly makes this class incredible: with his sense of humor, little funny comments and insights, his vast knowledge of many cultures and languages (which he flawlessly interweaves with the content of the course), and just his neverending desire to teach (and learn from!) his students. I loved loved loved it!","r"
98368,"Amazing course! Definitely recommend, especially as a writing credit","r"
98368,"Yes yes yes!!! Truly an amazing professor and all of the TAs are remarkable too. If you like any form of media(books, TV, Film, Music, etc.) this class will teach you to look at it all differently. It will inspire you to try new mediums and to seek the common ones in a different way.","r"
98368,"No, it is ridiculous that this is a requirement for the film major. Lectures were hard to follow and work was busy work with little guidance on how to do well.","dr"
98368,"I think this course is worth taking if you're interested in really deconstructing media. The lectures are interesting and the workload is not too bad overall if you're willing to deal with the readings.","neu"
98368,"I would definitely recommend. A really engaging and exciting class with a great professor.","r"
98368,"Yes, intellectual and interesting course with a challenging but achievable workload","r"
98368,"Yes, I would. This course helps you develop the skill of critical thinking and allows you to write about things you enjoy talking about.","r"
98368,"it's a requirement for certain majors, so I don't think my opinion here is important","neu"
98368,"Yes, this is one of my favorite classes at yale! I loved learning about media theory and defamiliarizing myself with so many objects and interactions that i encounter on a daily basis","r"
98368,"Yes, if you are interested in a class that really doesn't fall into any set category and will leave you grappling with a lot of big questions. If you don't want to think outside of the box or like a straightforward or easy to follow lecture, I don't think you will enjoy this class.","neu"
98368,"Absolutely. A very interesting class that forces students to evaluate the network of substructures undergirding everyday life.","r"
98402,"I am a STEM major and actually really enjoyed this class","r"
98402,"Absolutely. If Yale does anything right, it's the English courses. This course taught me not only how to write well, but how to write quickly.","r"
98402,"Yes, I improved my writing greatly","r"
98402,"No. This course simultaneously shattered my confidence and destroyed my love of writing. I suppose my writing did improve a bit over the course of the semester, but I don't think I ever want to write again after having taken Daily Themes.","dr"
98402,"Yes, absolutely!","r"
98402,"yes if they want to put time into learning to write","r"
98402,"Yes! It's a lot of work, but I think it has been genuinely fun and rewarding. You have no control over who your tutor is which I can imagine being very frustrating if you don't like your tutor. Otherwise, great experience.","r"
98402,"It's nice that the work is spread out over every day but it's hard to keep up with the load. I would recommend it mainly because it's a different style of learning than other classes and daily practice is so helpful for writing. It's probably mostly variable due to your tutor.","r"
98402,"Yes, if you're ready to commit to setting aside time for writing each weekday. There were definitely days that I had to phone it in (ie, crank out a theme in 20 minutes at 2am before going to bed), and in those moments, it didn't feel like I was getting the most out of the class. But the weeks where I was able to set aside time to write and really get into each prompt were great -- I learned so much about myself as a writer, I looked forward to the different prompts, and I could feel myself becoming more comfortable expressing myself on the page. It's definitely possible to do this class without getting a ton out of it, but I'd recommend it only if you're excited and ready to commit to it.","neu"
98402,"I would absolutely recommend this course!!!","r"
98402,"Yes. Even when the lecture was not interesting to me, the one on one instruction and reflection with my writing tutor was unmatched and very helpful. My work with Professor Gordon made this class worthwhile.","r"
98402,"Yes","r"
98402,"YES! an amazing course to improve your writing and reflect on everything in your life","r"
98402,"Yes, but not with Prof. Ehrgood.","r"
98402,"Yes, I would take Daily Themes. You will never have another opportunity quite like it. You will remember what you wrote about and how you wrote for the rest of your life.","r"
98402,"Yes!","r"
98402,"Absolutely. I would probably caution them that it really is so much work to write every day. It was probably more work for me, comparatively, because I can't simply write every day without obsessing over it throughout the rest of the day. That was important too, though. I am thankful I go to experience what it is like to live a life consumed with words. I hope I can do that again beyond this class.","r"
98402,"I would recommend it only if the person has a passion for writing. I didn't, and, while my writing definitely improved, I did not enjoy the course. If anything, my writing was forcibly improved by how much we had to write every week. It sucks up at least an hour of your life five days of the week. I thought we would have more freedom in what we wrote (and we did towards the end), some of the prompts were very picky. If you put in the work, though, it's easy to get an A-, hard to get an A (you have to show ""remarkable improvement"" throughout the semester). Lectures would drag on for a long time. But if you love creative writing, I would say go for it. Everyone else, think long and hard before taking this.","neu"
98402,"Yes! But go into it knowing that the value of the course will probably be in the work of writing your daily theme. I learned so much more from the process of daily writing than I did from lectures or from meetings with my tutor, and I think I would have enjoyed the course more if I had gone into it with the understanding that this would be true (and that it didn't mean I would have a worse experience).","r"
98402,"Yes. I dont care who you are or what you studytake this course.","r"
98402,"I went into this class expecting writing every day to get easier -- maybe it gets a little easier, but it never became a part of my daily routine like I wanted it to be. I almost always got to my daily theme at 11 PM or midnight when I wanted to go to sleep and had to write something that I sort-of cared about. I got a lot out of the class and don't regret taking it, but daily really does mean daily, and unless you are really focused the theme will always be in the back of your mind for an entire semester. So, if you're interested in taking the class, take the class -- it is really rewarding -- but know what you're getting into.","neu"
98402,"Take the course if you can commit to it. It is the kind of thing you will get out what you put in. It also depends on your tutor--as different ones make for very different experiences.","neu"
98402,"Yes, the practice of writing every day will make you a better writer, and as well make the process of writing feel far easier.","r"
98402,"Yes. But it is a lot of work","r"
98402,"I would because I loved working with my tutor and my writing really did improve.","r"
98402,"Yup, a different kind of writing class, you'll have a great time if you get a good tutor. 30 mins a week face-to-face is a short time though, imo.","r"
98402,"Yes very much. Its such a good class to practice writing","r"
98402,"I would because it really helps you become more comfortable with writing and understand what your strengths and weaknesses are.","r"
98402,"If you have any desire to improve your writing I would heavily recommend this course! It teaches you how to establish writing as a part of your routine and forces you to reflect on your daily life/surroundings (and replicate that in writing) in a way that I found really meaningful","r"
98402,"Yes! Great if you have the time and space for it emotionally","r"
98402,"Yes! But make sure that you aren't taking too many other high-workload classes. This class absolutely killed my sleep schedule (I often had trouble coming up with ideas and then would write on and off from 11pm to 2 or 3am), but I do not regret taking it at all. This class has been invaluable in improving my writing, and now even after the class has finished, I am writing for myself at least once a week.","r"
98402,"definitely! if you are interested in becoming a better writer (or reader) and are willing to put in the time (roughly 1 hr every day, 5x a week) to write, I would 100% recommend this class. it has easily been my favorite class at yale so far.","r"
98402,"In the class' current state, I would not recommend it to another student. The lectures and prompts must be vastly improved for it to be a worthwhile use of a credit or your time. Take any other English class instead.","dr"
98402,"No. There are way better creative writing classes out there (ENGL 120,121). I heard such great things about Daily Themes from my friends, but this professor was very different from previous lecturers who taught this class. I disliked many of the prompts and I thought lecture was useless.","dr"
98402,"I would recommend this course as an opportunity to practice disciple in building a skill. The content was also engaging, but the lectures at times were challenging to apply to my week's assignments.","r"
98402,"YES! If you have any interest in creative writing at all, please take this class. This is such a good entry point into the creative writing concentration because it really gives you a broad sampling of different perspectives into writing and it does not confine you to any one particular area. This class changed my outlook on creative writing at this school--I loved it!","r"
98402,"Yes! Especially if you like or want to improve your writing (mostly creative, but not exclusively). But Id say for anyone willing to put in the time. It is incredibly rewarding and just fun to write every day.","r"
98402,"As long as Andrew Ehrgood is teaching the course, I would not recommend it to another student. I also would be frank with them that there is a possibility they get a terrible tutor, in which case their experience in the class will most likely be awful. I wouldn't want someone to waste their time or their energy on this course if they don't have to.","dr"
98402,"Sure! Its hard though","r"
98402,"Dear God, yes. While you're at Yale, you should make a point to take every Ehrgood course you can. As you might've guessed by the name, the ""daily""-ness of the course is a bit of a slog, but it's worth it when you see your writing improve throughout the year. The lectures are engaging, the prompts are interesting, and the course overall was one of, if not the best course I've taken at Yale. I cannot recommend it enough.","r"
98402,"If you like or want to get good at writing regularly then yes","r"
98402,"I think it depends a lot on your attitude (how much you are actually going to invest in your writing vs just cranking something out every day) and who your tutor is (there seems to be a wide range in quality). The class is mostly about the tutor-tutee relationship - if they have good feedback, then I think it is a very worthwhile course.","neu"
98402,"Yes, but only if you fully commit to the class. If you dont spend a ton of time on your themes, your writing wont improve.","r"
98402,"I would 100% recommend this course to any student of any major. The skills you learn are applicable to any field and the assignments are fun!","r"
98402,"Yes, I would recommend this class! Its so valuable to learn to write every day, and fun to have a whole semesters worth of themes to look back on.","r"
98402,"definitely. you get out what you put in, so maybe don't take it with a super challenging course load. it is not as rewarding if you're consistently trying to get each theme done as a checklist item. the one on one tutor structure is an amazing way to learn and improve your writing","r"
98402,"If youre serious about writing, yes.","r"
98402,"YES. If you think you can feasibly spend about an hour daily on writing, take this course. No matter your experience or discipline, you'll become a better writer through it.","r"
98402,"If you love writing, yes. If you want to take a class with Ehrgood, wait till he teaches a seminar. You barely interact with him in this class.","r"
98402,"I would recommend only if someone wants to write more. Thats the only guarantee from this course.","neu"
98402,"I would for anyone who wants to get out of the normal patterns of writing theyve fallen into.","r"
98402,"I would recommend this course to any student who wants to improve their writing. It helps with fiction, non-fiction, personal narrative - anything that you write. I also think that the class gives students the space to reflect on their time as Yale students and would highly recommend the class to juniors and seniors.","r"
98402,"I highly recommend taking this course, especially with Ehrgood. You HAVE to take a class with this professor at least once in your Yale career. I promise you that you wont regret it.","r"
98402,"Absolutely","r"
98402,"Absolutely not. This is by far the worst class I've taken at Yale. I learned nothing during lectures. Please please please save yourself the time and don't bother with this class. All lecture is is Prof Ehrgood standing up at the front reading passages of writing he likes. Your experience is also entirely determined by your tutor, and I happened to get a law school student who wasn't a writer. dd","dr"
98402,"100% yes. I look at writing so much differently now. I have been enlightened.","r"
98402,"Yes! But the student should plan to spend a lot of time writing. I think I spent around two hours on this course every weekday, and ideally I would have spent more. I also might recommend taking something more structured first, like English 120 or 123. Daily Themes relies on students to set their own goals for writing. ""Write a theme with a list in it"" is a constraint, and a useful constraint, but it doesn't tell you what your theme should accomplish (e.g. catch a reader's interest, convey a particular emotion, explain the concept of entropy, process emotions around a breakup). Students might want to take a more structured class before Daily Themes, to get an idea of what their goals are/can be.","r"
98402,"I would, because of the writing by experience. There's also not a lot of engagement required. I wish there was a bit more grade transparency Prof. Ehrgood says we would get an A if we turned everything in on time but I'm hearing of some tutors giving different grades because they feel like it. Definitely adding some stress on my end.","r"
98402,"I would recommend it as I really enjoyed it, despite the writing being a bit overwhelming or boring at times. However, I am also a STEM major who had not taken many classes on writing before, and, when talking to my friends that are English majors or serious writers, it seemed that they felt it was repetitive of things they were already familiar with. But for non-English majors I would absolutely recommend it as a good way to improve your writing as well as an excuse to write about those topics that you've always wanted to but never had the time.","r"
98402,"Absolutely, if you're willing to put in the work and are passionate for writing","r"
98402,"Yes yes yes!!! If you vibe with your mentor, you will have the best time. Take this course to relearn the art of writing.","r"
98402,"Yes, if they love creative writing! This course is an awesome way to be committed to creative writing every day, and the 1-on-1 tutor meetings offer an unparalleled experience to really focus on unpacking your writing and receiving input to find and establish your voice as a writer. I would take this course if you love creative writing and are open to writing vulnerable and heartfelt pieces to get the most out of the course, and to feel like you wrote things that were personally meaningful. I think your experience in this course is really dependent on what tutor you get. I was very fortunate to have an incredible tutor (shout out to Rona!), but I had other friends in the course who hated their tutor and hated the course as a result. Also, the lectures are pretty boring and not super necessary to do well in the course. Even so, to me the course was about the writing not the lectures, so I really enjoyed it! Also felt like a low workload because there are no large assignments or readings during the week","r"
98402,"I would recommend this course if you enjoy writing, want to write more at Yale, or want to learn how to write creatively. The lectures have nothing to do with your ability to fulfill the assignments well, so regardless of the professor, you can take the course and get a good bit out of it: loads of practice writing. However, if Andrew is teaching, then I can't recommend the lectures themselves. If someone else is teaching, such as Oppenheimer, I have heard that the lectures are great, in which case I could recommend the whole package.","neu"
98402,"Yes, the wrriting tutors are the highlight of this course. You learn a lot from them and get out as much as you put in. This was also a great course to take senior spring as I now have a collection of writings to look back on.","r"
98402,"Yes! Daily Themes as a course is incredible; its such a special way to improve your writing through consistent practice and feedback. I do think student experience varies a lot from tutor to tutor, but ost tutor experiences I've heard have been lovely. I would say, though, that if Prof. Ehrgood is teaching the course again, maybe wait for a different year. He is not the most engaging lecturer, and most people I knew taking the course did not enjoy lecture/did not find it worth going to. I've heard much better lecture experiences from students who took the course other years with other professors (I have heard, though, that Prof. E is much better in a seminar, so kudos to him there).","r"
98402,"I would definitely recommend this course if you are willing to put in the work to take it. At the end of the day DT really teaches you discipline and consistency when it comes to writing, which is a skill that I am very grateful I now have.","r"
98402,"Yes if you're committed to writing this much every day and okay with working with the provided constraints.","r"
98402,"Yes, it's a great class if you have the time to invest into it.","r"
98402,"Yes, if you want to be self-motivated and explore writing a lot. If you don't like your TF I think it can be hard to engage with it and people I know dropped it because of that.","r"
98402,"Yes! Expanded and bettered my writing, also helped me experience a different type of class/learning","r"
98402,"Yes, but this is a commitment. I would compare it to a language class that meets 5 times a week. It will become part of your schedule. As someone who wanted to write mostly personal essays, write frequently, and receive a little but not too much feedback, I got so much out of this course.","r"
98402,"Not with Professor Ehrgood. I was unengaged and felt as if my writing didn't improve very much because I wasn't enjoying what I was writing.","dr"
98402,"I would recommend that students should decide whether or not to take the course based on their tutor. If you get along well with your tutor and have enough in common in terms of interest and writing styles, it's a fantastic course. However, if you meet your tutor and don't get along well or don't have a lot in common, you should consider dropping the course. It's hard to get a lot out of the class when you have a bad match with your primary teacher.","neu"
98402,"Yes.","r"
98438,"Yes! This class was exactly what I'd hoped it be as a second-semester senior looking to focus mostly on writing my thesis. Prof Mares and the TAs were excellent. I have a much stronger grasp of the development of European political economy over the course of the 20th century.","r"
98438,"Yes!! Great professor and I learned a lot. Great elective for global/polisci/ep&e","r"
98438,"Yes!","r"
98438,"I would highly recommend this course! I think it would be helpful to have a strong foundation in macroeconomics and comparative politics in advance, but either way students will learn a lot about policy.","r"
98438,"Yes, it is a fantastic course. I left the course feeling much more knowledgable especially about the history of European countries I was not previously familiar with.","r"
98438,"Strongly! It is an amazing class that taught me so much about Europe in the postwar period","r"
98438,"I would recommend this course to anyone who wanted a foundation in looking at capitalist economies comparatively.","r"
98438,"Depends. If you're interested in the subject matter then yes. But there's probably more interesting comparative politics classes out there.","neu"
98438,"Absolutely, one of the best classes I have take here. I learned so many new concepts.","r"
98438,"I would recommend this course to a social science major","r"
98438,"If you are interested in understanding how capitalism works across countries and how it developed over the last 50-60 years, then yes! I also think most Yale students who study economics are mostly focused on the American system and would benefit from understanding how it works in other countries as well. Also, the exams are not too bad, as Professor Mares runs through a bunch of potential essay questions and topics that you should know the lecture before the exam. The TFs also put in a lot of extra effort to make sure that there were plenty of opportunities for review sessions and for us to ask them questions.","r"
98438,"Yes! It's a great introduction to recent European political history.","r"
98438,"I would recommend it if youre looking for an chill survey poli Sci course.","r"
98438,"Yes. Everything in the global economy makes sense now.","r"
98438,"Yes! Please take it. This class is unique for Yale, and you will learn much more about economic policy than in any existing econ class. Material is quintessential for anyone willing to go into policymaking. It is also one of the few good classes at Yale which focuses on European politics (even tho we study Japan and a little bit US as well and the material is applicable to many countries). On top of that, the professor is sweet and knowledgeable, and the TFs are great.","r"
98438,"I would recommend this course to any student who's interested in political economy and would like to study countries that aren't named the United States of America for once. Our political discourse often invokes countries like Sweden and Denmark, but I didn't understand the specifics of what makes the social democratic model unique until taking this course (and how there is variation even among the Nordic countries). This course would also be a good fit for anyone who is interested in economic history and wants to understand how the economic miracle in countries like West Germany ground to a halt and how these countries have responded differently to globalization and deindustrialization.","r"
98438,"Yes! Definitely, especially if you're interested in learning about how different countries respond to crises, and how their responses vary across social welfare states, fiscal discipline, and Keynesian economics.","r"
98438,"Yes! Interesting content once you learn it but also very light.","r"
98438,"Absolutely, great content to learn","r"
98438,"Yes, but only if you have a good TA. The content is interesting but the professor could be more organized.","r"
98438,"Yes! A well-taught, interesting survey of capitalist systems and information that informs other EP&E coursework. A real class where I learned things I'll continue to use without an overbearing workload.","r"
98438,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was my first political science course at Yale, and while I wasn't immediately sure if I was interested in the material, the way it was taught allowed me to tangibly see my intellectual growth in the area. The workload was manageable and the essay exams were straight-shooting.","r"
98438,"yes! Isabela is a wonderful person and so, so knowledgeable. She is so passionate about these topics and is so excited about sharing her passion, which is all you can ask for in a professor.   Many people in this class took it in conjunction with Jacob Hackers Politics of US Public Policy, and I would really recommend this. The classes spoke to each other more than any other 2 classes I have taken at the same time at yale. Lots of lectures referenced similar concepts like policy feedback and path dependency, but this class is focused on Europe from 1920-2000, while Hackers class is focused on the US. Super interesting.","r"
98438,"Yes. 100%. I did not think I would enjoy this course, indeed was planning to drop it as I was on a heavy courseload semester, but it has become my most enriching course this semester. Additionally, it is one of the courses where I genuinely believe a lot of the concepts will stick with me beyond this semester due to how relevant and well-tied together the course was.","r"
98438,"If you are really interested in this subject then yes. If not you likely wont be heavily invested.","neu"
98438,"Interesting survey of European welfare states. Pretty localized and narrow to instructor's subject area, but she is very knowledgeable and passionate.","neu"
98438,"I would. You learn a lot about capitalism and how it varies between countriesthere's a lot more to be learned than you might expect! The readings were dense, but the TAs did a fantastic job explaining everything in section. And grading was very fair.","r"
98438,"I quite enjoyed the course material and would recommend this course to friends. It was very interesting and engaging and I learned a lot over this last semester","r"
98457,"I would recommend it as it is a fun way to learn more about Renewable Energy and it has a low work load which is nice.","r"
98457,"Yes- very interesting material.","r"
98457,"Yes, out of the box course that discusses different methods of energy utilization for the future of our world","r"
98457,"Yes! I really enjoyed it and think it's both a good class for humanities majors looking for an applicable STEM course and for STEM majors who want to think about social and financial applications","r"
98457,"Yes.","r"
98457,"Yes, it is a great course. If you are a humanities student, though, it may feel a bit too fast at the beginning because there are a lot of physics concepts to cover. Besides that, it is a great primer to renewable energy and (a bit of) renewable energy finance.","r"
98457,"Don't get me wrong this class was great, but his other class Fossil Fuels and World Energy is even better in my opinion. I think this class is harder than Fossil Fuels if you don't have some stem background, but still doable. I think either classes are a wonderful way to not waste your science credit on a gut that you do not engage with at all. These classes have honestly made me really optimistic about the future of the world and the energy crisis.","neu"
98457,"Yes - this is a great science credit if you have a good grasp of physics (probably including AP physics C) and want to learn more about why any of that stuff actually matters.","r"
98457,"Yes, absolutely! Its an all-around amazing course thats structured for ease of learning and low workload. Definitely one of my favorite classes.","r"
98457,"No. This is not a good science ""gut."" It is low workload but the exams are difficult.","dr"
98457,"Yes; if you are interested in renewable energy, this is a great class that goes into a lot of detail about the science and economics of renewables. Professor Oristaglio is great and his study sessions are very helpful. There are also field trips to energy sites that are good to go on. The TFs tend to grade p-sets unnecessarily strict, but Professor Oristaglio will fix the grade if points were taken away for no reason.","r"
98457,"If you need a science credit, the topics are interesting but i wasnt in love with the course","neu"
98457,"Yes! If you are committed to understanding, yes. It is not a gut you can just ignore","r"
98457,"Yes it was an amazing course","r"
98457,"Yes I would because Mike is great!","r"
98457,"Yes!","r"
98457,"Probably. If youre looking for a science credit with interesting applications, Professor Oristaglio keeps it pretty relevant to the world and teaches interesting concepts usually in a depth that non-science majors can grasp.","neu"
98457,"Absolutely. Recommend this to any Energy Studies student, but also to anyone with a passing interest in how science and policy interact. It's honestly really interesting.","r"
98457,"It's rare to find good science classes for non-science majors. Renewable energy is good but not great. You will learn much more than you think you will, and if you're interested in international relations, as I am, then you might find it surprisingly interesting. The class does not have a very high workload, but it doesn't have a very small workload either. There are 6 psets that take about 4 hours, and two exams, which take maybe 6-9 hours to study for.","r"
98457,"Yes! If you're interested in green energy and think it's important, definitely take. This course changed the way I look at the most crucial energy challenges of our time.","r"
98457,"Yes","r"
98457,"I would recommend it if they were interested in the subject, if students aren't passionate, then this course may seem more like a chore.","r"
98457,"Yes! I learned sooo much, the material was presented well, and if you're at all interested in the future of the energy sector, you should take this class.","r"
98457,"yes but note this course might be more challenging if you don't have a science or math background","r"
98457,"I think if an understanding of the basic science of renewable energy, from how it comes about (i.e. where is it abundant and why) to how we extract energy from that and supply it to the grid, is what you want, then yes it delivers. I personally think an understanding of this, and how world energy works more broadly is an important thing so think for that this course is well worth considering though others may disagree or weight the importance of learning about that to be less. Workload is not too high, prof is chill, field trips are cool. If you have an interest in energy and aren't doing STEM would highly recommend. For others, depends on your interest in energy. You won't be blown away by the pedagogy but I think the material is interesting and well worth considering as something to learn about","neu"
98457,"Yes if you are interested in renewable energy and can do math/chemistry/physics","r"
98457,"Yes! Learned a ton about renewable energy, very engaging and relevant for upcoming energy transitions","r"
98457,"Yes! This class made me pay more attention to infrastructure. I enjoy being able to look at a wind turbine or solar panel and understand how it operates. It's a very manageable science credit -- not too many p-sets, no crazy math involved. The midterm is a real time crunch, which is not mentioned before the test, and the final is definitely harder than the p-sets.","r"
98457,"I would certainly recommend this course. I am a Math and Physics major, so this course was a relatively easy and also very interesting science class.","r"
98457,"A valuable course to understand the changing energy environment especially with the current rate of change in the field during the 21st century.","r"
98457,"Yes! But only if youre actually interested in the content. Otherwise there are definitely science classes out there that are easier to do well in","r"
98457,"Yes. Science gut.","r"
98475,"Yes! My favorite class I have taken. Challenging but interesting","r"
98475,"If you take one history class at Yale, this should be it. Do not miss out on this tour de force that will leave you with so much food for thought about contemporary politics and society.","r"
98475,"Yes, I'd recommend this class if you're excited about fascinating lectures that shed light on present-day political dynamics and are ok with a lot of reading (or with pretending that you've done a lot of reading, which was definitely the route that the majority of my section took!). I might have enjoyed auditing this course because I found the lectures much more interesting than the readings or discussion section, but I'm still glad that I took it.","r"
98475,"I would reccomend that a fellow student take this class, meet with their assigned TA before the drop deadline, and switch to auditing if they feel their TA will not be understanding of the challenging logistical situation. The lectures are fascinating and very well delivered, and the content is extremely important for anyone to know, but with so much of the graded work ultimately left in the hands of TAs with no clear roadmap, caution is distinctly warranted.","r"
98475,"Yes! It is a lot of reading but I loved it regardless.","r"
98475,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student and would say that they should absolutely take it before graduation. It informs you of all the geopolitical tensions that have existed and continue to exist in Eastern Europe and in the world. Students should take advantage of the ability to listen to Professor Snyder's lectures while they have the opportunity.","r"
98475,"Yes -- this is the best course I have taken at Yale.","r"
98475,"Strongly recommend if you want to learn more about Eastern Europe. The exams are fair and straightforward. Be prepared to do some reading","r"
98475,"Yes, it gives you a comprehensive analysis of the area and time period by one of the top historians on it.","r"
98475,"yes-be prepared for a substantial amount of work but you will learn a lot","r"
98475,"Yes! I learned so much, about some of the most important things to learn and think about.","r"
98475,"Absolutely. Amazing overall class, I fell like I learned a lot.","r"
98475,"I would strongly recommend this course to any other student interested in history. Professor Synder is one of the best lecturers I have ever had and I learned so much through this course. The workload is not that heavy, even though there are a lot of readings, and the tests are not particularly difficult.","r"
98475,"Yes! Hundred percent. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale so far. The content is amazing, just like Snyder and (most) TFs.","r"
98475,"Absolutely! Snyder is one of the best lectures Ive had.","r"
98475,"Yes!! Professor Snyder is so good. Sometimes Marci Shore subs in for the lectures and she is just the best!","r"
98475,"I would! It's a great opportunity to study one of today's most important regions under one of the world's most knowledgable professors. That said, it's a very ""traditional"" history lecture; lots of focus on treaties, dates, warfare (to some extent), (male) politicians, and so on, so I'm not sure it is for everyone (long story short: a little dry). Also, it is very much what you make it. You'll get a lot more out of it if you do the readings.","r"
98475,"Yes, especially to STEM majors/people who might not take very many history courses. This is the one to take.","r"
98475,"Yes, would recommend - Prof. Snyder is amazing!","r"
98475,"Yes, even if just for Timothy Snyder","r"
98475,"Yes absolutely. Snyder really knows his stuff and this is history done right. Definitely worth your time.","r"
98475,"Yes","r"
98475,"Yes!!! Everyone should take this course. I learned so much and was left feeling shocked that I had not known all of this important history before the class. Definitely take it, it was my favorite class I have ever taken and Snyder is a very articulate and great lecture.","r"
98475,"Yes because it s a great survey introduction course to the Eastern Europe region","r"
98475,"Yes, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale because of the curriculum and professor's teaching","r"
98475,"Yes! I loved the course. One of my favorites at Yale.","r"
98475,"YES. this course was awesome so so so interesting going to lecture was like going to story time","r"
98475,"I would because I think it is worth taking at least one class from Professor Snyder, especially considering the current situation with Ukraine. There are a lot of readings assigned in the course, but you can still do well on the exams without doing many of them, as long as you take good notes. The chronology is definitely a pain to complete at the end, but it this relatively straightforward (although it is still open-ended, so it is unclear as to what the grading is actually based on). Sections (like other classes) aren't the most engaging, but even so I think the class is worth taking if you have an interest in the time period and / or geographical region!","r"
98475,"Yes! Great lectures - you learn so much. Prof Snyder is great and the TFs are also very knowledgeable and interested in the topics. Would recommend (the readings are a lot though).","r"
98475,"Yes! It's very well taught and the professor is very engaging!","r"
98475,"Yes, this is an understatedly important topic and professor Snyder is an excellent historian, which translates to his teaching","r"
98475,"I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in history, regardless of their particular focus. This course taught me a lot about summarizing the main points of large amounts of readings, as well as taught me to focus less on the dates and more on the shifts in ideology, culture, events, and the cause and effects of each of them. I am certain any history major will gain valuable skills that will help them with their other courses.","r"
98475,"Yes. Snyder is for better or for worse a leading global voice in this subject, and you will come out of this with a solid understanding of everything between Berlin and Moscow from the past hundred years. Its also a relatively easy class and one with streamlined lectures that are still very lively.","r"
98475,"Yes, coming from someone who was always taught history from a Western point of view, it is interesting to see how the same events unfolded in the East.","r"
98475,"Yes, if they are interested in history. It is a key region and time period","r"
98475,"Absolutely","r"
98475,"Yes, the importance of contemporary Eastern European history cannot be understated amidst current events. This course is very accessible to students who have yet to take a history course at Yale.","r"
98475,"I would absolutely recommend this class. Everyone should take a Snyder class at Yaleone of the best speakers I've ever had the privilege of listening to, and I learned a ton.","r"
98475,"Yes, Professor Snyder is a fabulous lecturer and you will learn a lot about how Eastern Europe has facilitated the course of world history","r"
98475,"Yes but theres lots of reading but the readings are interesting","r"
98475,"I 1000% recommend this class to other students. Professor Snyder is very knowledgeable and makes lectures engaging. I recommend taking notes and following along with the lecture outlines. There are a lot of readings on the syllabus but they aren't essential to understanding the material, though they are very useful for the final chronology.","r"
98475,"Yes! It is is a great survey course in Eastern European history. The professor is amazing and the class is well-structured. Be wary of the reading load, and don't get behind. If you do these things, it is not difficult to excel.","r"
98475,"Yes, any student interested in the history of the region or during this time period would be well served by taking this course.","r"
98475,"Yes. Prof Snyder is amazing and this is a wonderful survey course. You will also learn about some of the most influential events of the 20th century - just through a non U.S. centered lens (a good thing).","r"
98475,"Absolutely - a comprehensive look at Eastern Europe made simple and digestible. I walked in knowing nothing, and came out with a richer understanding of the Bloodlands that have been Eastern Europe, and the peace it is longing to attain for itself.","r"
98475,"Yes. It is a great history course that one can get plenty out of if they put in the time and effort.","r"
98475,"Yes, I feel that this is a class that would required interest in the subject along with some prior knowledge to really have a full grasp on it but if someone were to be lacking in those things or available time to complete the readings then I would not.","r"
98475,"This is a must-take at Yale if you're thinking about majoring in history or something similar, or if you aren't but just want a taste. I don't mean this just because Timothy Snyder is so well-known, but because his lectures are excellent and the subject material is very important to understanding crucial events in world history. It's a survey class that feels mostly targeted at first years or sophomores, or anyone who hasn't taken many history classes, but that doesn't mean it's not worth it if you are already taking advanced history classes.  The one hesitation is that most of the readings are organized in one pdf that goes on for hundreds of pages, which needless to say is incredibly inconvenient. If you do take the class, you should rent or buy or check out from the library as much as possible at the beginning so you don't have to use the pdf, which by the way, doesn't entirely match the syllabus. The class is so good that it's worth the frustration of the pdf, but be prepared.","r"
98475,"Yes, TS is a very impressive lecturer.","r"
98499,"I would most certainly recommend the course. It is very different to other courses in the university and allows for a new perspective in your life.","r"
98499,"Absolutely","r"
98499,"Yes! I think it is important to look at the complexities around food. It is unfortunate that food and intellectual discourse rarely converge in this country.","r"
98499,"I would recommend this course because I didn't really find any negative aspects of the course.","r"
98499,"Absolutely. I found the course material very interesting.","r"
98499,"Yes! Professor Freedman is a great lecturer and if youre at all interested in food this is a great history lecture to introduce you to historical approaches to the topic of food.","r"
98499,"Absolutely. If you love food, food systems, agriculture, or anything that is tangentially food-related, you will learn an incredible amount. Professor Freedman is also so much fun and super engaging.","r"
98499,"YES! a must take","r"
98499,"Yes it was fun","r"
98499,"If they are really interested in learning about food, this course requires a fair amount of self-motivation to actually learn the material and explore new concepts, because you can do well in the class without engaging much with the material. If they are simply looking for an interesting class to take that won't put too much stress on them, I would recommend.","neu"
98499,"Yes, I would recommend it. The course load is light, though there are two essays and two exams (which aren't necessarily hard by themselves).","r"
98499,"Yes of course! Especially if you want to take a laid back course which can accommodate a busy schedule, while still learning about about a fascinating topic.","r"
98499,"Yes, it is a very interesting, engaging, and relevant class without being overly challenging and I looked forward to it the most of all my classes this semester.","r"
98499,"Strongly, strongly recommend. This is a history class that is approachable to anyone. It's fascinating and relevant material. It's not hard -- you write two short papers and take exams that are very straightforward if you attend class and know what's going on","r"
98499,"Yes!","r"
98499,"Definitely would recommend for an interesting humanities course with lots of material that relates to your personal life. Low workload and TF was great, provided good feedback and lenient grading.","r"
98499,"Yes, could be a great fifth class and very interesting topics are covered.","r"
98499,"yes","r"
98499,"Yes, very interesting content and it is presented in an approachable way. Great professor and teaching fellows.","r"
98499,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. While it doesn't count as a writing credit, it allows for some practice writing papers and allows students to connect over similarities with food and culture. Food is global and connects us all and this class provided some information and knowledge along with more fun concepts.","r"
98499,"Yes! Great class and super interesting! Pretty easy so you can probably take it as a 5th class.","r"
98499,"Yes, the topic is very interesting, and the lectures and section time are very good. It also does not require a significant level of work.","r"
98499,"Yes, it was very interesting","r"
98499,"Absolutely. I loved Professor Freedman and the amazing guest lecturers that were brought in. I learned so much and felt it was an enjoyable and informative addition to my courseload.","r"
98499,"This was a really fun class. Really just the 2 papers and 2 exams but you can cram for those pretty easy. As a big foodie, it was nice to just have a point in time during the week to just talk about food trends across time, insecurities, and I learned a lot of pretty cool fun facts.","r"
98499,"Yes, if you need a 5th class or you really want to study food, but i dont think this is the best class at yale.","r"
98499,"Yes! This is a fun and informative course.","r"
98499,"If this person is interested in history or food or both, I would recommend this course to them.","r"
98499,"Yes! Especially if you cr/d/f and can just focus on the learning, this is one of those courses that gives you a toolbox of facts and frameworks that you'll be thinking about long after it's over. My friends have enjoyed hearing me recount what we've learned in class. Two short essays + two exams. Very reasonable grading.","r"
98499,"Yes - very fun course with a great instructor","r"
98499,"Yes absolutely. You will never look at food the same!","r"
98499,"Yes! The content is incredibly interesting, you get freedom in what you investigate yourself through the papers, and it's quite relaxed. I strongly recommend the class to anyone.","r"
98499,"Professor Freedman is down to earth and spits facts during lecture. I like the prof a lot, and I think this would be a very very fun 5th class!","r"
98499,"Yes, especially for a stress-free and easy history class that talks solely about food and how it shapes culture. Thought it was a great intro class.","r"
98499,"Yes! Its so good and worth it. Not a difficult class but really interesting! A perfect elective.","r"
98499,"This course was really fun and low-stress. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in food or history.","r"
98499,"Yes 100%","r"
98499,"I would recommend this course. The course is interesting and allows the student to study a very specific, unusual area.","r"
98499,"Yes, if you're looking for a good fifth class to take -- I think History of Food is a great class that will also fulfill a distributional requirement.","r"
98499,"Yes, it is the best course I have taken at Yale. I learned a lot and greatly enjoyed both the discussion sections and the lectures.","r"
98499,"Yes, great course with really interesting information.","r"
98499,"Yeah, it's interesting and covers a lot of subjects that you would not get the chance to learn about in other courses at Yale.","r"
98499,"I would recommend the course because I find the subject matter fascinating.","r"
98499,"This class is fun and worth just sitting in and listening. There aren't very many classes like this, and the guest speakers were cool too! However, I didn't find it the most engaging or novel class, especially as someone who cares a lot about food and cooking. I wish there were elements that tied to course to the real world more.","r"
98499,"Yes, but only if they are willing to engage with the course content on their own accord.","r"
98499,"I would recommend the course to other students because I believe it can be interesting to anybody. Food is part of all of our lives and I feel it is important to know about its past.","r"
98511,"Yes, for those who haven't yet taken an ethics course, this is a great intro to the learning style involved, while also implementing extremely important issues about the environment.","r"
98511,"Yes!","r"
98511,"Absolutely recommend to any EVST students.","r"
98511,"Yes! Professor Latham is a great speaker and the TF team is wonderful. Really interesting content.","r"
98511,"I would not. I do not think this course was well-structured for student learning.","dr"
98511,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The concepts are intriguing, topical, and applicable to our every-day view of the world. Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer as well, and with this being only his second time teaching the course, I am confident that it can only get better.","r"
98511,"NO- This class is not going to help you solve the world's environmental problems, and does not encourage action. It is a lecture in which the professor asks for student input, so much of the time in class is spent listening to other students","dr"
98511,"No, if you want to learn about environmental ethics you're better off taking a philosophy course or an EVST course. This class was very poorly organized, narrow in scope, and un-engaging. I guess if you're looking for a gut or an easy 5th class this might be it, but it felt like a waste of time for me and I was disappointed by the lack of organization or direction in the individual lectures and throughout the semester. It didn't feel like we got anywhere.","dr"
98511,"Yes. The TAs and professor are very passionate, helpful, and insightful.","r"
98511,"yes - beneficial content","r"
98511,"I wish this course was a core course for many majors! If I could take it again I would. The content covered is very important and the conversations about the issues covered are important conversations to have both inside and outside the classroom.","r"
98511,"I think this course would be fundamental for any student planning on an environmental background, including environmental science and engineering.","r"
98511,"Yes","r"
98511,"I wouldnt really recommend taking this course unless you simply took it as a 5th class that you might credit/D so that you are given the readings and get to go to lecture but dont necessarily have to worry about philosophizing. Readings are really interesting but the class really isnt organized to facilitate learning outside of those intense readings.","dr"
98511,"I would, only if he/she is interested in this particular topic to some extent. I come from a philosophy background and have an interest in environmental issues and very specifically wanted to learn about the philosophical foundations of that. So if you share that conviction, take it. Otherwise, maybe..?","neu"
98511,"yes! great start to thinking of the ethical concerns and different moral approaches involved in environmentalism","r"
98511,"Absolutely!","r"
98511,"Yes, though it leans a little bit more environmental than philosophical as the course is currently structured. Professor Latham is super knowledgeable, and the combination of background ethical theory and case studies is effective. Tests arent all that scary and help apply concepts, and the course content is fascinating in general. Environmental studies majors should have an exposure to this side of environmentalism at some point, and this course is generally effective at starting the first steps in that direction.","r"
98511,"Environmental majors should take this class","neu"
98511,"I would recommend this course to a student interested in Environmental Studies or learning more about ethics. It's a good way to learn about the history of environmentalism and how people's understanding of nature and conservation/preservation has changed over time. It also introduces you to a lot of environmental writers and philosophies from the humanities side of Environmental Studies. Otherwise, this information might not seem relevant but could be a good gut.","r"
98511,"I would recommend this course to other students. The course content was very interesting and has allowed me to approach environmental discussions from a different perspective.","r"
98511,"Yes anyone who is interested in the environment and philosophy, other people might not find it as interesting","r"
98511,"Yes, this course is a great introduction to the philosophy surrounding environmental issues, and is taught in a suitably beginner-friendly manner. The course addresses directly every topic from traditional ethical theories all the way up to ideas and issues being explored presently.","r"
98511,"Yes, but only if you are truly interested in the intersection between both. It can be truly captivating, but the exams are sometimes not incentivizing or feel accurate to what you know.","r"
98511,"Absolutely. I learned so much about the ethics behind our changing climate.","r"
98511,"This was the second time that this course was taught, and although the topics were engaging, a few topics seemed to be repetitive. Examinations were based on students' ability to make philosophical arguments, but this type of writing was not discussed in lecture or in section very much. The lectures themselves were focused on more abstract concepts relating to environmental ethics/issues, similar to Bioethics and Law, but the exams did not reflect the learning well in my opinion. If you are not familiar with philosophy or already have a background in environment, I can see how it can be difficult to take this class because ""novel"" and ""creative"" philosophical arguments are considered for the A range.","neu"
98511,"I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is remotely interested in issues of environmentalism/sustainability! There are many different ideas of what is ""right"" in environmentalism, and it is a good skill to have going forward for just about anyone how/why to judge different actions in different scenarios, as they pertain to climate change and sustainability.","r"
98511,"I think this class is so important and I wish I had taken it sooner. For environmental studies students especially, this course laid the groundwork for understanding the challenges in the field and the current proposed solutions. I learned the various factors that go into making solutions/decisions to these issues, and the ethics behind them. Though some of these things were previously intuitive, I found it really helpful to be introduced to structured arguments. I know I will use this information as I move forward in the field. For non-majors, I think this course is still really interesting for considering real-world issues using philosophical arguments. I liked how all the philosophy was tied to real-world problem solving.","r"
98511,"Yes! So important to learn about the ethics of everything especially the environment","r"
98519,"Highly recommend to EVST sophomores","r"
98519,"Yes! Professor Wargo is wonderful!!","r"
98519,"Yes. Especially now that this course is a seminar, it feels much more digestible and informative.","r"
98519,"Yes, it's a pretty solid course, and Prof Wargo is very experienced in the field. If you are ready to engage a lot with the material and ask extra questions, then this is a great course for you--but if you don't take much initiative, your grade will be fine, but idk if you'll get much out of it","r"
98519,"Absolutely, if you have any interest in environmental law, policy, or justice.","r"
98519,"Absolutely! Additionally, if a student takes this class they should talk to Professor Wargo about their interests in the environment as he has a lot of wisdom to share","r"
98519,"Yes, this class is amazing and provides information that everyone should have. This class addresses some of the greatest challenges the world faces today, and it is important that everyone understands the extent to which systems of power have abused the environment and common people. Everyone can come out of this class with at least one takeaway.","r"
98519,"Absolutely, it was fascinating and the readings and class sessions supplemented each other well. It's also a manageable workload so you really get to engage with the topics.","r"
98519,"i would if they have very niche interests; but it is not actually a survey of law and policy, more of hazards and health risks","neu"
98519,"I would recommend this class to other EVST majors interested in taking a class on environmental policy. This course was a good foundational introduction. This class might also appeal to students interested in public health, since most of the topics covered had a heavy emphasis on human health impacts.","r"
98519,"Would recommend to a student interested in understanding how environmental regulation is applied, or lacking, in the real world.","r"
98519,"This course allows you to pursue a final topic that interests you completely. For EVST majors, this course would greatly help you determine thesis topics that may interest you.","neu"
98527,"Yes, if you want a low-stress science credit that is also interesting i would take this class.","r"
98527,"Yes, for anyone looking for a science credit.","r"
98527,"I wouldn't recommend this course unless you are very interested in the topic at hand. The course itself is well paced, fairly graded, covers interesting topics, and bring in guest speakers that are very worthwhile to hear from. However, this course does not feel cohesive, in part due to the fact that there are two professors who take turns lecturing every day. They also alternate in who writes the problem sets, which gives a sense of whiplash. This alternation becomes hard to follow and becomes a slight nuisance. I've had a course with multiple professors before, and I think it works better for them to split teaching the course into a first and second half instead of passing the torch back and forth.","dr"
98527,"Yes, if they are interested in climate change in general.","r"
98527,"great gut! very interesting with amazing profs / TAs","r"
98527,"Definitely interesting information but I feel like it could have gone deeper","neu"
98527,"Yes! It is a great way to learn about climate change topics, and the grading/layout is very forgiving even if you have not taken many natural science courses.","r"
98527,"Yes; it's a good general introduction to climate science.","r"
98527,"Overall a great science credit for anyone with an interest in climate change. There's definitely a LOT of content thrown at you in the lectures and it's sometimes hard to draw the connection between class and psets but the teaching staff are really helpful and kind, and you leave the semester with a significantly deeper understanding of the factors that shape the ecosystem + climate change as well as current literature and emerging fields in the area. The midterm is definitely to watch out for though, as it's essentially pure memorization.","r"
98527,"yes because its interesting","r"
98527,"I think the content of this course is really interesting, but its just so poorly taught. The class isnt fun or engaging at all. But again, the content is interesting so Id only recommend it if you are interested in getting a broad glimpse at climate change issues and the scientific ways that people are trying to solve these issues.","dr"
98527,"If you are looking for a relatively easy science credit perhaps. Just don't expect to get much feedback on any of your work. We didn't even receive our midterms back beside the grade.","neu"
98527,"Maybe, but Ive heard there are other better climate change courses that might be better.","neu"
98527,"I would definitely recommend this course. I think the information is very important for everyone to understand no matter what field of study they are in. The work requires a significant amount of time, but it is worthwhile because it helps you understand and think through the material.","r"
98527,"Yes, nice gut science","r"
98527,"Yes! This was a great way to develop fluency on modern climate issues and hear from leading researchers.","r"
98527,"I might if they are EVST majors who are looking for an easy credit, but if you're looking for a science credit, skip this.","neu"
98527,"Yes. Very good for learning about the different components of climate change","r"
98527,"The content is useful to know, but the course overall is not super engaging.","neu"
98527,"Yes I would. It was a good intro to climate change science.","r"
98527,"I would recommend if they are interested in climate modeling","r"
98527,"Yes, if you're interested in climate science and want a class without too high of a workload.","r"
98527,"nice, interesting science gut","r"
98527,"Yes, pretty useful especially in understanding what constitutes climate change.","r"
98527,"Yes - it is a great introduction to climate studies especially for non-majors","r"
98527,"Solid science credit for non stem majors, but a little more challenging than I had anticipated. It had a little more math than I thought.","neu"
98527,"No unless you have to take it","dr"
98527,"yes if you need a science credit that does not require too much work. very doable assignments that are evenly spread out during the semester, and as long as you do the psets and study, the midterm was totally fine.","r"
98527,"Only if they feel comfortable doing word problems that are potentially unclear/require some time thinking and/or visits to office hours. Also, I think having a bit of a physical science background would be helpful and make things more understandable. And, if they think they can pay attention for 70-minute lectures.","neu"
98527,"Yes but only if you have enough foundational knowledge about environmental science, energy science, and chemistry.","r"
98527,"Yes, it is a low-stress way to learn a lot about climate science.","r"
98530,"ABSOLUTELY! You watch some of the most amazing films with an amazing class. This is an experience you CANNOT miss.","r"
98530,"100%","r"
98530,"Obviously. Best class I've taken at this school.","r"
98530,"Absolutely. I can think of no better way to spend a senior spring than watching and learning about amazing movies with an incredible professor like Camille. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.","r"
98530,"I would 100% recommend this course to another student. I am in a completely different field, and loved this introduction to classical Hollywood. It is a really interesting and fun class that I think everyone should take!","r"
98530,"Absolutely. Never again will I be able to sit down every week with other like-minded students and watch these films on a big screen. Please please please take this class if you can!","r"
98530,"ABSOLUTELY! Sign up. It will be your favorite course at Yale. You'll get to meet one of Yale's most thoughtful, engaging professors and watch classic movies with a class of caring students and TFs. In each magical class, you'll watch film clips, listen to film scores, and learn so much about Hollywood. You'll get to pick your own adventure to chart via your essays. And most importantly, you'll have SO MUCH FUN!!!","r"
98530,"Yes, definitely. Professor Thomasson is one of the best professors at Yale, and beyond that, the subject matter of the course is applicable for everybody. It really augments your appreciation of film, even if you are just a casual film-watcher.","r"
98530,"This is one of those classes that is different from anything else at Yale in the best way possible. I came into this class knowing some things about Classical Hollywood and don't feel like I left learning that much more than when I came in, but I never felt like coming to lecture or section (!!) was a waste of time. You can take it as a fifth class -- other than the midterm/final, there's practically no homework outside the Film Diary entries, so on a normal week this class took up my Tuesday night and nothing else. If you think you might enjoy watching movies every week, then I see no reason why you wouldn't want to take this class.","r"
98530,"Yes, Camille is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. She visibly cares a lot about her students.","r"
98530,"YES. Take this class if you can get into it. Best class at Yale.","r"
98530,"Its the best course 100% Camille is the best Professor ever. Talk to her she is amazing","r"
98530,"Absolutely","r"
98530,"Absolutely! One of my favorite courses Ive taken! Professor Thomasson is a gem and is very kind and generous with her time and the energy she puts into the course. It really felt like a community by the end of the semester which I cant say for many courses.","r"
98530,"Absolutely! This is one of the best classes I've ever taken. If you get in, take this class!","r"
98530,"Yes, this is maybe my favorite class Ive taken at Yale.","r"
98530,"YES!!! This course and Professor Thomasson changed my perspective on film and life in general. I feel like my love for writing has been reinvigorated and my appreciation for classics and the art of story telling is alive.","r"
98530,"Yes. The films will always stay with you.","r"
98530,"Definitely! If you are a filmmaker or film buff, you have to take it. If you are just interested in cinema and need an art credit, this course is an awesome choice, but you have to really embrace it, going to lectures, sections, and screenings each week! It is one of my favorite classes at Yale so far!","r"
98530,"Yes! This is the best class I have taken at Yale. It was such a joy to come to lecture every week.","r"
98530,"Absolutely. If you get in, by all means take it! You'll learn to appreciate (Hollywood and other) film in a far more nuanced way and will also have a fun time while doing so. This course was definitely a great counterweight to the major-focused courses in the rest of my schedule.","r"
98530,"Yes!!! I love the films and lectures so much.","r"
98530,"Yes! Even though I knew very little about film, I truly felt compelled during classes and discussion sections. The films we watched in-class were wonderful. Camille is wonderful. The teaching team is wonderful. This class has been the highlight within my Yale career. I loved it!","r"
98530,"Yes, absolutely. This class is fantastic. You can look at the syllabus right now and see exactly what you'll be working on for 13 weeks of class. It is a fantastic survey into the Classical Era of cinema, which overlaps with some of the most important moments in U.S. history. Movies are a spectacular lens for viewing social change during this 40-year period, and this class likely relates to so many other things you're studying in ways you don't yet know. The Tuesday night screenings are a highlight. There are so few opportunities to see films like these in large theaters with such engaged audiences (people audibly laughed, shrieked, and booed) and I loved each film. Prof. Thomasson is the kindest professor I've had at Yale and is so, so invested in each of her students. Her care in crafting this course extends to her selection of TFs, each of whom were amazing.","r"
98530,"Absolutely. Phenomenal course that offers a great intro to Hollywood history. The screenings are great and Camille's lectures are incredibly engaging.","r"
98530,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially to non-film majors who can get the course to count either for their major or for a distribution credit. I would also recommend this course even just as a total elective, to a student in any year or semester. It was a surprisingly good choice for a fifth course there was a significant amount of weekly work but it was all enjoyable and I looked forward to classes and screenings, which lessened the weight on my courseload.","r"
98530,"Absolutely! The lectures fly by because they're so engaging, and you get to immerse yourself in a world that you might not have otherwise!","r"
98530,"Yes! Esp if you have any interest in films. I've never taken a film class ever and I am so thankful this was my first introduction. If you want a fun WR credit, take this! I promise you won't regret it","r"
98530,"Yes yes yes!","r"
98549,"Yeah, the movies are all amazing and so worth watching besides Il Divo.","r"
98549,"Would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in cinema and Italian culture, and even those who don't. You'll be taken on a magical journey!","r"
98549,"Yes! If you are interested in Italian culture, definitely yes.","r"
98549,"I would, but only if they are prepared for the quick turnaround and are prepared to be engaged.","r"
98549,"If you are interested in film or Italian film and writing essays about it than for sure. If you need the class for a wr or some other requirement than there are probably better options but it's not a bad choice.","neu"
98549,"Yes, if interested in Italian film. Not a hard course but watching all the films does take time.","r"
98549,"Yes, if interested in film.","r"
98549,"Yes. Its really interesting and a great way to learn about film if you dont have much prior experience","r"
98549,"Yes! Fun films, approachable writing workload, passionate Professor","r"
98549,"Yes, even as a STEM major, I found this course and the selected films to be incredibly interesting. The essays can definitely be a struggle depending on the grading of your TF, but it is pretty rewarding.","r"
98549,"Yes absolutely!!!!!","r"
98549,"Yes, its a great class, and a great way to explore a new topic for non majors.","r"
98549,"Yes if you like Italian film. No if you cant stand it.","neu"
98549,"Yes. I wouldnt say this course is a gut, but definitely manageable in terms of workload. Its a very interesting way to fulfilling a writing credit and explore a field that I would never have learned about.","r"
98549,"It is a great course to get your writing distributional requirement. The workload is very manageable and the essays give you a lot of freedom to express your thoughts.","r"
98549,"Sure","r"
98549,"Definitely. One of the best I've taken at Yale. Professor Marcus is a gem, as is the feedback you get from your TAs. You also watch incredible films.","r"
98549,"Yes, if you are interested in film. If you are looking for a writing gut, I think there are better options.","r"
98549,"Yes, with some reservations. I took this as a fifth class and was not ready for the workload level (four papers and a final exam). The grading depends on your TA, but it was a bit tougher than what I had experienced in other literature/humanities courses.","r"
98549,"Yes! I learned so much, and I will never watch movies in the same way. It is a perfect and necessary course for anyone studying film.","r"
98549,"good course, great professor, fun and interesting","r"
98549,"It was fine, not a bad class but definitely not worth the hype of all the reviews (and pretty sure from talking that many of my classmates would agree). A few really great films but mostly boring, rigid paper formats and quick turnout times make the papers a huge drag/intellectually unexciting","neu"
98549,"This course is a spectacular introduction into Italian film with a professor that could not be more knowledgeable and helpful. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Italy or film, especially the confluence of the two. I think if you're looking at this course because you need a chill writing credit and you think it's a gut, and you are not interested in film in an academic sense, ENGL 120 might be a better choice. This class is designed for students that are new to film studies, and while I think students more well versed in film are at an advantage at the start, by the end you will know a lot about the topic. It's engaging and entertaining and the movies are mostly very good -- some standouts are Cinema Paradiso, Bicycle Thieves, and Life is Beautiful -- take the course!","r"
98549,"Yes but not as a super gut class, only take if youre at least somewhat interested in film analysis.","r"
98592,"Yes, I think everyone should take this class! JT is a great professor and you learn so much.","r"
98592,"All Global Affairs majors will go through the course. For some, it will be incredibly valuable. For others, it will be totally useless. Thus, it is difficult to answer this question.","neu"
98592,"YES!","r"
98592,"Yes, required for global majors but so helpful when reading research. Changed the way I read papers presenting data.","r"
98592,"GLBL 122 is required for all Global Affairs majors and is only available to Global Affairs majors. For those who are not quantitatively aligned, this course is just a pill you have to swallow. Unfortunately, it is inexplicably taught in Stata, which has been mostly replaced by the more powerful and more popular R. I am doing political science research and my Stata skills are of little to no value since the professor and his colleagues all use R.  That said, if you enjoy statistics, this will be a breeze!","neu"
98592,"Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course as well as GLBL 121 to other students. I would say it is absolutely essential to Global Affairs majors (as well as required) but that non-majors should take the sequence if they are interested in statistics. Friends in parallel introductory statistical sequences reached nowhere near the depths of theory that we reached in the same amount of time why would you want to know less?","r"
98592,"Most students take this course as a major requirement for global affairs, but I do think it's valuable outside of that. I had no statistics background before the GLBL stats sequence (of which this is part two) and I learned a lot.","r"
98592,"100%","r"
98592,"This class is required for everyone who is taking it so I dont know that I need to recommend it. But I enjoyed it!","neu"
98592,"I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for an easy stats class. I think it might be possible to get a broader knowledge more efficiently through another course. However, I do think JT ensures that we truly understand the concepts he teaches.","r"
98592,"If they're not majoring in global affairs then theres no point to recommend this course to another student","neu"
98592,"It's a fine requirement for the Global Affairs major, and you will learn a lot, but you should be prepared to be frustrated along the way. Lectures sometimes moved extremely slowly (they would get bogged down by unnecessarily long or repetitive answers to questions), such that we ended up not even getting to a bunch of the material we were supposed to cover. Problem sets can feel very repetitive, and it took an extremely long time to get feedback and grades back after submitting them. Perhaps most frustratingly, this class has a ridiculously large emphasis on correct and precise phrasing, which is reasonable, except that JT is not at all consistent with his wording in class - and then to make matters worse, the slides rarely actually have the correct phrasings (they just have questions asking for interpretations), so I was frequently unsure if my answers would receive full credit or not.","neu"
98592,"Yes. Despite its issues its still a good quantitative class, and youll definitely remember the things you learn because theyre hammered in quite a lot","r"
98592,"requirement, else no","dr"
98592,"Yes. If you are a global affairs major, this class teaches crucial skills.","r"
98592,"Yes, see above re applied multivariate course.","r"
98592,"Yes! Really great if you want to understand why concepts happen. JT does a great job of connecting all ideas back to the beginning of the course. It moves fast, though, so go to all lectures if you want the full benefit.","r"
98592,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It teaches the fundamentals needed to interpret data accurately and reinforces learning through constant practice during PSET's and during lecture participation.","r"
98592,"I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to strengthen their understanding of statistical analysis. It is challenging at times, but I do think it provided a strong foundation in statistics that I'll be able to improve upon in the future.","r"
98592,"Yes, it is a wonderful way to gain basic and nuanced insights into the statistical tools required in the policymaking world. It develops your understanding of the quantative approaches to much of the material we have in the Global major.","r"
98592,"Certainly. JT is a fantastic professor and does a brillant job of teaching students and ensuring that everyone clearly and deeply understands every concept. The content of the class is very important for all people across all fields and is especially important for Global Students.","r"
98592,"I mean you have to take it. But JT is great, and they do a great job teacher.","neu"
98592,"It's a requirement for GLBL, but beyond that...I mean JT is a source of joy and fun, groan-inducing dad jokes so I would definitely recommend it for that. I also thinks it's really valuable to know stats. And Jane was a great TA. I would say I would recommend the course, so long as the lecture is better-organized (as outlined above) and explanations in lecture are more clear.","r"
98592,"You will have to take this course if you are a Global Affairs major. AQA II is not the most intellectually-stimulating course, but it is necessary for you to understand data and extract actionable information from it. If you do take this course, be sure to get close to JT as he will go above and beyond to ensure that you come out of the class with an appreciation for data and will do his best to make learning about the subject as enjoyable as possible.","neu"
98592,"No, I strongly believe that AQA II shouldnt be a required course for global affairs students. Global affairs encompasses so many different fields and job possibilities - to require AQA II is completely a waste of time for most students. While I concede that AQA I provides information and skills that everyone should know, the technicalities of AQA II is beyond the scopes that many GLBL students will ever have to utilize post undergraduate.","dr"
98592,"I think for students who are preparing for a career in public or international policy, this class gives you exactly what you need in terms of quantitative skills. Thus for students looking to enter those career spaces, I would recommend this course. However, for students that want to delve deep into theory and statistical academia, I think this class would fall short for them.","neu"
98592,"i would take it only if you're a global affairs student","neu"
98592,"Yes, it gives much fuller picture of statistical analysis beyond 121.","r"
98592,"Yes, I would. Both JT and the TAs are very helpful and the class is taught very well. JT makes the material/class interesting even when its really dry stat material.","r"
98592,"Im really glad I was required to take this course. I think a lot of the regression content we learn will be applicable in a lot of future career paths.","r"
98592,"Yes.","r"
98592,"required for global affairs majors","neu"
98592,"Yes, if you need the credit. The professor is genuinely great, and he is really committed to getting students through the slog of material.","r"
98592,"Yes, its the most engaging stats class Ive ever taken!","r"
98592,"It's required for GLBL so yes not otherwise.","neu"
98592,"Highly recommend. Although it is for the global major, I really feel JT teaches the material very well and helped me better understand stats than the stats 100 series courses.","r"
98592,"It's a GLBL requirement, but I genuinely fell in love with statistics and the importance of being precise with the way you describe statistics. It's a useful skill for any future data analysis, and it's good to understand the different distributions and how things work.","r"
98592,"It's not that bad of a requirement, but it's worse than AQA I for sure. JT covers like half as much material, so each lecture is dragged out and it's hard to stay engaged. It's basically the same thing over and over again (interpreting coefficients in Stata output). JT's slides are also really awful this semester. But it's still more useful than the average Yale class, so it's not too awful of a requirement!","neu"
98592,"I mean, this is a mandatory class, but JT makes everything an instant recommend.","r"
98592,"Absolutely","r"
98592,"Everyone has to take this for GLBL major so take it - JT makes a subject that can be boring the most interesting and understandable it can be","neu"
98592,"Yes!! Now that Ive taken this class with JT, I am very confident in my ability to synthesize and quantitatively analyze any dataset using the tools he gave us. This has truly been the best stats/data analytics class Ive taken at Yale.","r"
98592,"If youre not a Global Major, no.","dr"
98592,"I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. The professor is super engaging and I feel like I learned a lot (in both quantity and quality). I also learned an important resume skill of data analysis, and am excited to see how I can use Stata more in the future. A lot of what we learned also felt very applicable to other courses I have taken, where being able to read regressions is very helpful.","r"
98592,"Highly recommend! Extremely enabling environment to learn an otherwise tricky quantitative course.","r"
98592,"Definitely!","r"
98599,"Yes, only if they are absolutely sure that they are interested in thinking and talking about academic research in the social sciences that utilizes randomized experimental design.","r"
98599,"Hopefully next semster or time it's offered this class will be better organized.","neu"
98599,"Yes, good experience","r"
98599,"Yes! Great class for Global Affairs, Political Science, and Stats Cert! Cross listed a ton!","r"
98599,"Yes. I am an S&DS major and I think it is one of the most applicable electives I have taken.","r"
98603,"Yes I believe that the course is still worthwhile to take especially if you are interested in pursuing medicine.","r"
98603,"Yes! I loved this class. Professor Fallon is awesome and the material is interesting but the workload is low.","r"
98603,"yes! especially if you have any interest in global health","r"
98603,"I don't think I can in good conscience recommend this course to another student. The material we discussed was generally interesting and I enjoyed the course but I think there are better ways to spend your time at Yale than taking this course.","dr"
98603,"Absolutely. If you have any interest in learning about global health and how health is understood, managed, interpreted, and addressed globally, there's no better place to start than this course. You both learn a great deal and also are not challenged too much. Prof. Fallon is fantastic.","r"
98603,"This course is required for the Global Health Scholars Program, so in that regard, yes. For those who aren't in the GHS program, however, my answer would be no--if the course was kept in its current form. I think that this course has the potential to teach students new concepts related to global health, but the current structure of the course is very surface-level, and not a great use of 100 minutes of lecture each week. I don't think it's realistic to restructure the course as a seminar (though it would be great if it was!), so I think that better utilizing sections and revamping the course material would equip students with the most information about global health.","neu"
98603,"Yes, really interesting class that is low workload, honestly a good 5th class to take to just learn and not worry too much about grades. Also open-book midterm and final meant not everything had to be memorized.","r"
98603,"YES!","r"
98603,"Yes if they do not know much about global health as it covers a lot but not super in depth. This class covers important topics for anyone no matter their prospective career or major, as the pandemic showed us","r"
98603,"I'd recommend it if you dont mind having to answer why certain people do or do not deserve healthcare, there will be people in the class who will defend their right to vaccinate children in foreign countries when they were 14 years old as part of missionary work. While this is not what the professor teaches this is the kind of discussion that happens in sections and the sort of people the class attracts. If you don't mind this or can deal with being annoyed then sure take the class","neu"
98603,"Yes!","r"
98603,"Yes I think so. It's a good intro course to themes in global health and gives you a wide range of topics that you could delve into further in future courses.","r"
98603,"I would 100% recommend this course to another student! Dr. Fallon was amazing!","r"
98603,"No, I don't know if it's necessary to learn about global health at such a basic level. It's better to take a more advanced class.","dr"
98603,"Yes","r"
98603,"Yes--very broad but insightful exploration of global health!","r"
98603,"Absolutely, this course is applicable to any field and provides the foundation and intellectual challenges needed to apply it","r"
98603,"Yes. This is an amazing course I would recommend to anyone who has always wanted to understand what global health is about.","r"
98603,"yes","r"
98603,"Yes, I would recommend this course. Although it is introductory, preventing us from going very in-depth, I came out of it with a better understanding of the history of global health and current issues. The case studies we learned about were very fascinating. Discussion sections were fruitful. I believe understanding global health is important for anyone interested in health/medicine and global affairs.","r"
98603,"I would if they're interested in global health. It seemed like a great precursor to understanding and engaging with the subject and I do feel like I learned quite a lot.","r"
98603,"Yes, really interesting and lots of cool guest speakers","r"
98603,"Yes! It's a very useful class that enables you to understand global health in a very comprehensive and practical way.","r"
98603,"yes! Every topic that we covered was extremely interesting and engaging, and the assignments gave me the space to research issues that i was interested in.","r"
98603,"Id recommend it if youre curious about global health. Its also an easy class with just two papers to write.","r"
98603,"No, there is not really a reason to take this class if you are not a global health scholar. There are many more seminars and HSHM lectures that better represent public and global health. Though this course is more contemporary, I believe that Yale just needs to make more global health-specific courses. There is no way that this is the only opportunity students have to learn about global health. It is simply not substantial and it makes you leave class thinking... what did I learn? But the guest lectures were great. They were the better days.","dr"
98603,"If you want a general introduction to global health, yes.","r"
98603,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! For those taking a heavy load of STEM classes, I feel that this course is a great low-workload, generally low-stress class that still pushes you think think critically with a more humanistic perspective. For pre-meds, I also think this course is a great way to start thinking beyond the biological determinants of health.","r"
98603,"If you're a Global Health Scholar, you have to take this class. Otherwise, if you're looking for a class without a high workload and potentially interesting classes, this could be a good fit. However, I think your time would be better spent taking other global health/social science classes.","neu"
98603,"It's a good and interesting introductory course, but I did not really receive helpful feedback for my work. My midterm grade in Canvas was put in as a different grade than the comments that explained my score, and I never received clarification on the discrepancy despite several follow-up emails with the TFs. My own section TF nor the TF that left the Canvas comments were not the person who graded my midterm, and I never received single email from the TF I was told graded my midterm. The feedback I got on my writing assignments throughout the semester was also super vague. For one assignment, I got points taken off but was not told what I could have done in order to have received full credit.","neu"
98610,"It's required so you don't have much of a choice but this course was significantly better than International Security, so much more organized and the professor was very engaged.","neu"
98610,"I recommend this course if you are looking for an econ approach to developmentthis would be a great class to supplement Intermediate Macro.","r"
98610,"Yes, you learn new econometrics methods that are important as well as big picture development ideas.","r"
98610,"- not unless they are a global affairs major - the course was very informative in how to approach econometrics, papers and various studies","dr"
98610,"Youre required to take it as a Global Affairs major. I assume if you like economics/developmental economics, this is a class that is light but valuable for you to enjoy.","neu"
98610,"I would not recommend this course to anyone not in the Global Affairs major. Global Affairs majors I would recommend you take AQA and intermediate macroeconomics before taking this class, as you will have a real advantage over those that have not.","dr"
98610,"The vast majority of students have to take this for the global major. Anyone else who is considering it needs to know that it is a quantitative class. This course needs to be renamed to Development Economics and Research Methods- it is NOT an international development course.","neu"
98610,"Yes, if they are interested in topics in International Development","r"
98610,"I would not; however, it is an elective.","dr"
98610,"I would not take this course if it is not required for your major","dr"
98610,"I would not recommend this course to another student (although, should they be a GLBL major, they may well have to take it anyway). The Department of Global Affairs should intervene either by allowing the course requirement to be waved with Intermediate Macroeconomics (which covers the topics at a much greater depth even if not taught in terms of development) or by intensely restructuring the course to provide the depth of theoretical exploration Global Affairs students want and are left searching elsewhere to receive.","dr"
98610,"yes","r"
98610,"I would not recommend this course unless It is a requirement as there are other development economic courses offered at Yale that seem better.","dr"
98610,"No, the only reason I took this course was because it was a Global Affairs prerequisite course. I had heard from other students how and this course was and they were correct.","dr"
98610,"No, but it's required. I don't think a single person woke up in the morning and thought ""I want to go to Approaches to International Development today"" in the entire course of the semester. The professor tried so hard to make this a good class, but personally I'm guessing she had almost no support from the Jackson school and had to make everything up as she went. How can you expect anyone with no experience to be able to create something perfect from the ground up and with no support? Also, the cold calling in this class was miserable. I've been in classes where cold calling felt pretty random and not too intimidating, and this was not one. I dreaded every day of this class because of the absolutely humiliating cold calling.","dr"
98610,"No. But you dont have a choice. Its a shame that the core global classes are such washes.","dr"
98610,"not unless you have to take it","dr"
98610,"It's a requirement.","neu"
98610,"If this weren't a core class to the Global Major, I would really recommend against taking this class. I think students are better off listening to a podcast on Economics and they would learn more faster.","dr"
98610,"Yes. I think with time and a few tweaks, this course will be really helpful for those in the GLBL major.","r"
98610,"If you're a global major, you have to take it. I think it could be helpful for people interested in macroeconomics and development.","neu"
98610,"I wouldnt recommend this class but you have to take it if youre a global major.","dr"
98610,"Very interesting content!","r"
98610,"No.","dr"
98610,"I would only take this class if you are a global affairs major. I think it suits the major.","neu"
98610,"I would not. I don't feel that I got much out of this course, and it was poorly organized.","dr"
98610,"Yes for Global majors","r"
98610,"Not unless required in its current form.","dr"
98610,"This is a requirement, but honestly this class made me regret majoring in global affairs at times. I didnt find the material generative or insightful, and there is a lot of work with little payoff because the exams are weighted so heavily.","neu"
98610,"No, but its mandatory for Global majors. Its sad that the Global core (Security and Development) are such weak courses. I really hope that Jackson overhauls these classes in the future.","dr"
98610,"Absolutely not, for reasons above.","dr"
98610,"I think that the course is necessary for the major, but the GLBL department has been finding issues replacing instructors and finding someone to teach this core course that grasps what about international development we need to learn/know. I think I learned valuable STATA for research, but that R and Python are commonly used languages instead. Finally, I just think the structure in general could be more well thought out and that we need to understand as GLBL majors what are the core courses in the major striving to teach. I feel like I haven't come away with a fundamental understanding of international development that I need. However, I do appreciate that the course taught me about research in international development, even if this research was more economics-focused, and that now I understand basic methods like RDD and calculating average treatment effect through a Potential Outcome Model.","neu"
98610,"No but since its a required class for GLBL majors, please get a better professor","dr"
98610,"As currently organized, I would not recommend this course. I think it left me with many questions unanswered. I wish I learned more about (1) What development is, (2) Who is trying to do development, (3) What they are doing, and (4) how successful they are.","dr"
98610,"This course is a major requirement, but I think it does a satisfactory job at introducing Global Affairs students to international development. It could certainly cover some topics more in depth, but for the first time it was taught by Ardina I think it was pretty good.","neu"
98610,"I strongly strongly do not recommend this course, unless you are a global major in which case you are forced to take it. Considering that this is one of the core courses of the Global major and we had a new instructor, I was surprised that no one from the department bothered to sit in on a class. If they had, they would have found that what we were promised in terms of a new international development professor is not what we got. Coming off of international security, I was excited to learn more about development theories, but instead we focused so heavily on quantitative models and random statistic theories that I was severely disappointed. Lectures are not worth your time honestly you could probably skip or not pay attention/just review the slides on your own and still get the same (bad) grade. The grading is on an arbitrary curve, with no insight into the grade distributions. The professor cold calls, so be prepared to answer random questions that are barely related to the material. The professor is also extremely unresponsive to class feedback, and didn't even address the midterm feedback we provided in the middle of the semester. The exams test random STATA code questions as well as questions related to like one minor slide from the lectures. Also, the wording of the exams is also horribly confusing so it is difficult to even understand what it is trying to test. If you want to really learn international development theory, your time would definitely be better suited elsewhere, perhaps in an econ seminar. Jackson completely flopped on this class, I don't understand why they can't find a good professor.","dr"
98664,"I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any student, regardless of how many (if any) history courses he or she has taken at Yale already. The material is interesting, the professor and TAs (at least for this iteration of it) were good, and it was not needlessly work-intensive.","r"
98664,"i would not recommend this course to another student. professor stuart is an excellent professor and i hope to take a seminar with him in the future. however, the TAs grade extremely harshly. THIS IS NOT A GUT. this course is advertised to be accessible for non-history students so the TAs grade the STEM students wayyyy easier than the humanities students. so my piece of advice to future students of this course: lie and say you're a stem student even if you aren't. also, the TAs grade absolutely everything in the class (exams too) so if your TA doesn't like you...good luck","dr"
98664,"If you want a gut and are ready to fully and wholeheartedly embrace the guttiness, this will work. However, if you want to be engaged in class and have classmates who are engaged in discussion section, this might not work. My TF was great, but sections were still sometimes difficult because not many people wanted to talk and it often ended up being the same 3-4 people carrying discussion. So, if you want to be engaged in the class and don't enjoy awkward silences in section, you could very well be frustrated by this class. But if you want a class with some interesting history and not much work, this course suits you.","dr"
98664,"Yes, great way to get a insight on the world in 1800","r"
98664,"No. Poorly taught. Lectures are unengaging, chore to sit through them. Content tested is not clear, which made preparing for quizzes/exams difficult. Papers don't help you learn history.","dr"
98664,"This course is a nice gut history class for STEM majors, but the workload is not as low as it seems at face value. The readings pilled up around the middle of the semester, and you have to put some effort into the papers (if you are a beginner at history papers like I was).","neu"
98664,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who may be interested in the subject matter. The class is fun, relatively low workload, and engaging. The course material is also engaging and easy to learn.","r"
98664,"NO!!!! Save yourself. I dreaded going to class every day because of how bad the lectures were. Literally any other Hu credit would be better than this. Only take this course if you like timber and codified constitutions","dr"
98664,"This is great class for any Yale student. A well-versed history student likely would not get very much benefit out of the simplicity in which the information is presented, but anyone else would learn a lot. It is a great introductory history course with workload on the lower end, manageable essays and reading assignments, and relatively easy exams.","r"
98664,"I would recommend to someone who has an interest in history and wants an overview of many different global events. This course covers many continents and no one event is covered in depth. If that is what you like that it will be good for you. The exams and papers are also logical and fair. Professor Semmel's style of lecture is also more thematic and philosophical which I enjoy.","r"
98664,"The material in the course is very much a hit or miss. Some weeks I found the reading very engaging and other times it was difficult to get through. Overall, if you are looking for a continuation to AP World with more primary sources, this is a good course.","neu"
98664,"The workload is low and you will gain a strong sense of what was going on in the world around the year 1800. The essays are fun to write and teach you how to analyze sources well.","r"
98664,"I would not recommend this to another student if they are looking for a gut. I did not think this class was a gut with two exams, three papers, and weekly readings. Find another history course if you want to take one.","dr"
98664,"Yes","r"
98664,"100%. Take the class. Get a world scope of the world and the class itself will not have you losing sleep. Worth it in the end.","r"
98664,"This course is a very easy, survey-level history course. If that's what you are looking for, take it. If you want something more complex and in-depth, I would look elsewhere. The writing assignments can be frustratingly simple to somebody who would like to go into more detail.","neu"
98664,"Yes would recommend","r"
98664,"This was a very interesting course if you are looking for an introduction to either history or global history. The Professor is amazing and his lecture style is captivating. However, the material can feel very random and unconnected at times. The paper prompts are very basic and make it difficult to write strong analytical papers.","r"
98664,"I would but you have to be prepared for really hard to follow lectures because at some points I had no clue what the professor was talking about.","r"
98664,"Absolutely. Very good introduction to world history and thinking critically.","r"
98664,"Yes, if they are looking for a good 5 class.","r"
98664,"Yes.","r"
98664,"Not if the style of lecture goes unchanged","dr"
98664,"If you already took global history classes before (like AP World History), then you may not learn as much or be as engaged. This class feels more like a global history class for someone who have never taken one before. Moreover, this class got a patch note buff and is not a gut class anymore. That said, I would give it a try during shopping period, especially if you have not taken a global history class before.","neu"
98746,"YES YES YES, especially if Professor Beckerle returns to teach it in the future. Cannot stress enough how engaging and informative this class was for me. It's set me on a new focus in my political science career.","r"
98746,"I would recommend this course to another student who has a prior, somewhat-developed interest in human rights. I would not recommend it to a student who is looking for a course that will plant a seed of that interest inside of them: because this course is a general overview, it will not be able to spark excitement in the way other courses (such as a more in-depth seminar on the relationship between climate change and human rights, or a course on the rights of refugees, or etc.) are.","r"
98746,"Yes! A very insightful lecture that approaches human rights from a variety of angles. Kristine was a huge part of why this course was so phenomenal.","r"
98746,"YES!!! It is such a good overview of human rights and its theories and it really leads one to reflect SO MUCH after every reading and lecture.","r"
98746,"Yes, if you are looking to receive a good broad overview of what the world of human rights and the academic & political world around it looks like. It offers a great starting point for engaging with more nuanced topics and concepts, and doing ambitious work outside of the classroom.","r"
98746,"Probably not. The lectures were interesting, but the reading responses felt like makework, and section discussions rarely added anything of substance to the lecture.","dr"
98746,"I would recommend this course to other students interested in Human Rights or political science.","r"
98746,"Yes, if you have genuine interest in learning about human rights and is willing to put in the work! Keeping up with the readings and engaging in lectures would allow you to get the most of the class. However, Professor Beckerle was a big part of what made the class so amazing, so I am not sure how it would look under another professor.","r"
98746,"I would recommend this course to another student. The lectures are critical and engaging to facilitate dialogue, learning, and inquiry. Through the lectures and the course materials, I gained a critical, multidimensional survey of the principles and politics that undergird human rights developments. I also found the course to be very accessible, especially because I did not have a strong background in human rights studies prior to taking the course. I also appreciated the wide array of course materials that were employed, including podcasts, news articles, academic journals, etc.","r"
98746,"I would recommend this course to anyone whos interested in the study and practice of human rights. Its a great introductory course and covers everything from refugee rights to the environment. The course is incredibly relevant to the present moment and does and excellent job of equipping students with the tools they need to address the pressing human rights concerns of our time.","r"
98746,"Yes! So many interesting and valuable pedagogical methods a very engaging environment","r"
98746,"Yes. I would definitely recommend this course to other students who are interested in human rights advocacy and law. It is useful for understanding the history of the system and how it works today. Furthermore, I appreciated that the class did not take human rights entirely for granted and instead we discussed its origins and thoughtfully critiqued our understandings of them.","r"
98746,"Yes, this course was intellectually challenging due to all of the theoretical readings, but I enjoyed learning about the foundations of human rights. The lectures were always engaging and the group activities helped to cement my understanding and put it into practice. The teaching fellows were always very helpful and provided great feedback that facilitated my learning.","r"
98746,"Yes, but only if they want a strong overview on the mechanisms of international human rights law and policymaking, but if they care about a specific human rights issue they should take a class that focuses on it instead","r"
98746,"Yes! It is a great introduction to human rights.","r"
98746,"Yes - you learn a lot!","r"
98746,"Yes, it was paradigm-shifting when it came to political institutions. I don't think I know a single student who didn't have their mind dramatically changed on some issue","r"
98746,"1000%. My all-time favorite class at Yale. Professor Beckerle is an outstanding professor and I feel grateful to have taken this course with her.","r"
98753,"Yes, if you're interested in the intersection of art and technology.","r"
98753,"Yes! Professor Lee is a gem. She is so kind and possess such a wealth of knowledge. If you commit to engaging with the material, you will learn so, so much. Throughout the course, we discussed the importance of collaborations between artists and technologists (as well as broadening our notion of technologists to include artists). Whether you are a CS major looking to broaden horizons or someone with an interest in art, this course is an amazing, low-stress way to get acquainted with art history and the present-day trends in NFTs and AI generated art.","r"
98753,"yes, this is a must-take.","r"
98753,"Yes! If youre interested in learning more about art and modern art take this class","r"
98753,"Yes, but be prepared to do a lot of studying right before each exam and put time and effort into the paper assignments. You have to be really interested in the topic. Ultimately though, yes, because I learned so so much and in the end it was definitely worth it.","r"
98753,"Yes, if they want a broad survey of art history! However, it might helpful to have taken at least one other art history class before taking this class - as this seems a little more advanced than other introductory classes at Yale.","r"
98753,"Yes if you want to learn more about art history and technology. I thought it was really interesting!","r"
98753,"Yes, if they were interested in either art or technology. I think that tI gained a lot of knowledge that I may not otherwise have encountered.","r"
98753,"Yes","r"
98753,"Yes I would highly recommend this course! Learned about a lot of super interesting topics and I looked forward to going to class each week. The assignments were very doable and didn't even feel like work. As a CS student, it was cool to learn about the intersection of art and tech, and the more CS-y related topics (like NFTs and AI) were particularly interesting, especially seeing how such topics are treated within a humanities/art lens.","r"
98753,"Yes if you have interest in art history. Or else it can be boring and hard to memorize stuff","r"
98753,"Not particularly it would not be the class I would bring up","dr"
98753,"yes! I learned some cool stuff and it was a good art history credit for my major. Just be prepared for memorization-based exams.","r"
98753,"Definitely. Very accessible regardless of whether you're an art history major or a STEM major looking for a humanities credit, and the content of the course is fascinating and helped me broaden my knowledge of art significantly.","r"
98753,"I would recommend this course to any student interested in expanding their knowledge of art. The subject matter is extremely broad, and there is something in this course for everyone.","r"
98887,"It was a fine survey of applied stats from a linguistic perspective. If that's what you're looking for, then yes.","neu"
98887,"Yes, but only if you have a coding background and are interested in linguistics. As someone with more of a linguistic background (and having taken CS50 w/ minimal other coding experience), the coding required in assignments was sometimes quite tough, although not impossible. If you have other background knowledge in NLP, that would be a great asset -- some groups had very complicated final projects that I could not have implemented with my limited background.","r"
98887,"Yes, if they are interested in the intersection of linguistics and programming, this is a great survey of ways to apply the latter to the former.","r"
98887,"Yes, if taught by Prof. Frank. It is a great introduction or even second course in NLP techniques.","r"
98887,"Yes, if you're very interested in NLP and computational linguistics. Class is a lot of work but p-sets are graded fairly and as long as you do the work you'll be ok. Don't take this course if you're really only interested in transformer-based architecture or neural networks, as it only touches on those the last couple classes.","r"
98887,"Yes, if you have strong background with Python and machine learning. It's very heavy on the computational side and I had a lot of catching up to do throughout the course.","r"
98887,"Professor Frank is incredibly passionate and engaging. I learned a ton about many computational models used for linguistics and the problem sets were enjoyable and not too difficult or time-consuming. The only assessment was an in-class quiz that had people stressing and it seems like we all overprepared (which was, perhaps, the point).","r"
98887,"Yes, its well taught and very interesting. Understand basic stats before you do.","r"
98887,"I would recommend this course to another student, but not to a linguist who is just looking for a QR credit, as you need to be quite mathematically minded (and good at Python!) to keep up in this class. But the material you will learn is fascinating and, like all linguistics classes, will seriously change the way you view language.","r"
98887,"I'd recommend this course for anyone with a computational background and some level of interest in applying it to natural language processing. That said, this is definitely not the course that will teach you to reproduce ChatGPT, so one should know that going in-- it's less about deep learning and more about the probabilistic methods that came before. It's a good course overall though, and there's a significant amount of freedom in the final project which enables a more thorough investigation/application of deep learning techniques for those who are interested.","r"
98887,"YES! This was the most useful and exciting couse I have taken. Prof. Frank is awesome.","r"
98887,"I would. It is a great introduction to computing and probabilistic modelling for those curious about how language modelling works (eg from GPT).","r"
98887,"Yes. This is a wonderful introduction to linguistics for anyone with a techincal background. You will find it relatively easy and be able to enjoy the topics a ton.","r"
98887,"Absolutely! Perfect for those in computer science who want to learn NLP, for those statistics students who want to learn an application of statistics, and for linguistics students who want to learn the computational side.","r"
98887,"Yes, I would recommend. I did computational linguistics research before taking the class, and this class often made me think ""I wish I had known about this."" However, if you have a math or programming background, the pace of the lectures is somewhat slow.","r"
98915,"Absolutely! Math 112 is full of real-life concepts and applications. Even if a student does not need the course for their major, if they are looking to fill their ""QR-credit"" they should look no further.","r"
98915,"If you take this class, take it with Eric Geiger","neu"
98915,"Yes, I believe that it was a great course to receive the QR credit needed for distributional requirements. I also believe that for anyone needing Math 112 prereq this is an easy-to-follow course to complete.","r"
98915,"No unless you need this for a prereq not clear enough explanations and not time convenient study sessions","dr"
98916,"Only take this course if you need it as a prereq-- most students need some sort of math for their majors or QR so this is just like a Calc AB class","neu"
98916,"Honestly, it wasn't a bad course. The pset's could feel a little overwhelming, but the peer tutor's were really helpful. I think this is a good place to start if you need to take calculus.","neu"
98916,"Yes I would. I think it is a great class to begin your math journey at Yale or even just fulfil the requirement you may need. I thoroughly enjoyed it.","r"
98916,"Yes, if you need it as a pre-requisite","r"
98916,"I would recommend this course to another student, especially one that feels they have a particular weakness in mathematics as this course provides a curriculum of work that supports more complicated math for other majors. Even if a student simply wants to take a math course to keep their mathematical thinking sharp, this course provides a challenge through the problem-set questions and exams which, in my mind, makes the class worth taking.","r"
98916,"Yes I do. It is challenging if one does not have experience with calculus is is definitely manageable and there are lots of resources for assistance.","r"
98916,"Yes, if you need to take this course it is very doable.","r"
98916,"I would recommend this course if a student is unsure of their mathematical capability but still want to explore the field. I think this course helps in regards to helping people find their passion in math or be able to have a better relationship with it.","r"
98916,"Yes, I thought it taught me the basic skills necessary for future math classes.","r"
98916,"I'd recommend should you be taking it as a prerequisite or if you are genuinely wanting to improve your calculus skills. Professor Geiger is a great teacher and can make the process much smoother in terms of apprehension of foreign or semi-foreign material.","r"
98916,"Yes! This is a great class for anyone looking to improve their math skills or fulfill a math requirement for a major.","r"
98918,"I would recommend","r"
98918,"Yes, if you are taking it with Prof Geiger.","r"
98918,"Yes!","r"
98918,"If you need it for your major/ are super interested in calc, but it's not one to take for fun or as a gut.","neu"
98919,"Yes, I would. It gives a helpful background of calculus that is needed for higher lever math courses.","r"
98919,"I would recommend this course to another student if they wish to improve their Calc skills. I would tell a student to take advantage of the Peer tutoring sessions and office hours to better their understanding.","r"
98919,"I would, it was a good, straightforward course about calculus. Expectations were clear and numerous chances given to improve ones grade and abilities.","r"
98919,"only if you have to take it and do some research and get a good section prof","neu"
98919,"If they want to further their knowledge of calculus, then yes.","r"
98919,"I would recommend it! I came in having taken Calc before but it was four years ago and I had forgotten almost everything. Despite this, I felt like the class was well-resourced enough that anyone could catch up to speed no matter how rusty their math skills are. The professors (like Meghan and Rachel) are genuinely invested in supporting students, and this interest really shone through!","r"
98919,"I would recommend to anyone who enjoys math and/or needs it for their major.","r"
98920,"Yes. This course effectively teaches calculus.","r"
98920,"Yes!","r"
98920,"If you need Math 115, yes. Otherwise, it would depend on the person","neu"
98920,"I would. I think this is a prerequisite course for a lot of STEM majors, so most do have to take it.","r"
98920,"if you need it","neu"
98920,"Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn about calculus.","r"
98920,"Yes. Its well taught and gets you to the next level of math.","r"
98920,"yes","r"
98920,"Yes, if you need it as a prerequisite it is a good course","r"
98920,"I would recommend this course to other students just starting math at Yale. I think that math 120 would have been too difficult of a math class for me to take since my Calculus BC skills were a bit weak, and the intensity of the course would have been challenging to handle. Math 115 was more suitable to take as a first math class for someone who was not that strong in Calculus BC and had not taken a math class in a while.","r"
98920,"Yes, pretty engaging and not too hard.","r"
98920,"I definitely would. The course was not too challenging but I learned a lot.","r"
98920,"Only if they are interested in learning the tools of calculus or need it. It is not a fun class to take.","neu"
98925,"Yes if you're interested in the subject or want to pursue a higher math level. If you're taking it for a major requirement, then MATH 118 is more helpful because it teaches more practical applications of math.","r"
98925,"If a student is interested in taking higher-level math classes, then yes. But I would not recommend taking it to someone who is interested in math for its own sake. I liked math a lot in high school, and I decided to take this class despite being a humanities major, but I don't think that was the best decision.","neu"
98925,"Only if necessary, the pros do not really outweigh the cons here.","neu"
98925,"Only if they can get a good professor","neu"
98925,"yes, but only if they had rachel as their professor","r"
98925,"I would not recommend this course to another student solely because of the concerns that I raised in the previous question. There is also much content that is covered in this course and I felt that there had to be more support systems in place to ensure that each student was succeeding. Additionally, the cutoff for the grades was steep and required a lot of outside learning to get the grades needed.","dr"
98925,"If they want to learn calculus. It is a useful skill, although I personally would not take this course for fun","neu"
98927,"This class would be good to take for students passionate about Calculus or who would have to take it for their major. It is a very satisfying conclusion to a 2-3 year journey in Calculus overall. Don't expect it to be particularly easy if the material is new to you.","r"
98927,"Yes, it is a great course. A lot of group work. Office hours every night to work on PSETS and meet people in the class.","r"
98927,"Not unless you absolutely need it, and you should look at other multi variable calculus options because the set up of some other classes and/or their grading schemes, etc. may be better suited to what you want to do (ie. ENAS 151 if you're doing engineering, Math 118 for social science, etc). This class is probably better tho if you're looking to fulfill a requirement for something like econ, though.","dr"
98927,"I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about the next concepts in calc beyond Math 115. I would especially recommend taking the class with Professor Argue.","r"
98927,"I took 120 to get a QR credit. In retrospect, there's probably a lot of other classes I would've found more interesting. But if you need to take 120, take it!","neu"
98927,"Hell yeah","r"
98927,"I would recommend this course if you need to take it for your major or a prereq. However, it wasn't as fun as some of the other QR classes out there.","r"
98927,"I would recommend this course to another student as I enjoyed the content.","r"
98927,"It's not really a ""take it for fun course,"" but the workload never seemed unnecessary","neu"
98927,"I would recommend this course to students interested in math or who require it for their major. I don't believe the content of this course is obviously applicable in everyday life, though it is interesting and useful to those in specific fields.","r"
98927,"I would recommend it to students who need it for their major","r"
98927,"Unless they need to take it, I would not","dr"
98927,"I would recommend this class to a student that is interested in math and is applications in physics. I would not recommend this class to a student looking to get a math credit out the way.","neu"
98927,"Absolutely. It is well taught, understandable, widely applicable, and just really fun.","r"
98929,"No, avoid this course if you do not need to take it.","dr"
98929,"Maybe, it can be useful for higher level economics and mathematics but I definitely wouldn't take it for fun.","neu"
98929,"I would recommend this course to another student. Although calculus has a reputation for being a drag - and it can be if you make it out to be - I believe that I greatly enhanced my critical thinking skills and general mathematic inventory.","r"
98929,"If interested yes. The course is actually not too hard and the topics are very useful in other classes.","r"
98929,"Yes - its a great course for anyone interested in going further with the physical sciences.","r"
98931,"Most likely not. It is a useful class for some occupations, but those who would benefit from it later already have it as a requirement for their major, and those who don't need not subject themselves to the horrors of three-dimensional math.","dr"
98931,"Yes, if they are interested at all in taking higher math courses, physics, chemistry, or engineering. I thought this was a very good course.","r"
98931,"No. Unless it is required, it is an unnecessary stress that students shouldnt put themselves through.","dr"
98934,"Yes!! The course is well organized, the professor is great, and the material is useful. At first I had some reservations about taking 225 because I am a CS major and this is a math class, but it turns out a lot of CS electives require linear algebra as a prerequisite. This couse was also my first introduction to proofs, and it did a great job! (much better that CPSC 202)","r"
98934,"Yes, great intro to proof writing.","r"
98934,"Yes, it gives a strong mathematical foundation for future courses.","r"
98934,"Yes, if you like math/are a math major","r"
98934,"I would probably only recommend this if you wish to pursue higher math that requires concepts from linear algebra. Even though I appreciated the intellectual satisfaction I got from proving key concepts and understanding the deeper reason for why certain applications work, I don't think the work and frustration that the rest of the course gives you is worth it if you just want linear algebra's practical applications (222 is probably preferable here) or you are curious about math in general (a different advanced course may do here).","dr"
98934,"Absolutely if you have any interest in proof based math.","r"
98934,"I would definitely recommend this class to others as it provides a solid foundation for proofs and linear algebra as a whole.","r"
98934,"Yes, I enjoyed learning about proof-based linear.","r"
98934,"If you have to take this course or are really interested in learning about proof writing and are willing to put in the work, then I would recommend taking this class. This course is definitely not the easiest and you have to put in a lot of time and effort outside of class time going over the material if you want to fully understand the concepts.","r"
98934,"For those interested in more formal math, yes. For those who need math for more applied purposes, no.","neu"
98934,"Yes, it is a great course for those interested in pursuing higher math classes.","r"
98934,"Yes, good class.","r"
98934,"yes if the student is interested in pure mathematics","r"
98934,"I would recommend this course because I think the thoughts processes developed are applicable to many parts of life outside of linear algebra.","r"
98934,"Yes, it is great for people considering a math major.","r"
98934,"It's a necessary course to take, and the material is not bad. I just think it's a shame that such a great subject and a great opportunity is wasted (and it's doubly stinging because they seem to emphasize the importance of the opposite so much).","neu"
98934,"Id say its important content but the teaching detracted a bit from it","neu"
98934,"Yes I would, it'll improve your ability to learn and understand math at a higher level, and it will teach you important skills if you want to take upper math courses.","r"
98934,"Yes! Linear algebra is so conceptually fascinating and has so many direct applications to the physical sciences (QM, stats, solving systems, etc). Beyond learning the concepts, I think I am a better logician/reasoner now and appreciate and enjoy *math* (rather than just pure computation) so much more now. Class definitely is not easy, but struggling through ideas, proofs, and psets together makes for great bonding experiences and new friends!","r"
98934,"I would recommend this course to anyone who plans on continuing their math education at Yale, as it does a really lovely job at showcasing what the subject can do with regard to bringing separate fields together; that includes anyone whose major relies on math, from physics to economics to computer science.","r"
98934,"Honestly, I haven't taken applications so I don't have a basis of comparison but I've heard people like that one more. This one still teaches you the concepts, I guess you would just have to learn the applications yourself if you're going into something like QM","neu"
98934,"I would only recommend this course to another student if they need it as a prerequisite for the math or physics major or if they have a significant interest in proof-based linear algebra. I did not strictly need this course as a prerequisite for my major and I generally prefer application to theory, so I had a difficult time adjusting to this class and its abstract and proof-based nature. I would definitely advise any student interested in taking the class to think hard about their choice and/or consider taking MATH 222 if they are more interested in application or are interested in an applied science.","neu"
98934,"I would recommend this course for almost anyone doing a Math or Computer Science-related major, especially in machine learning, since it is almost guaranteed to be applicable to other fields.","r"
98934,"This course is only recommendable to a math major who has taken some linear before. Else, it would seem that math 222 is objectively a better option.","dr"
98935,"If you're interested in fields like math, CS (specifically AI), probability, etc., this class is a must.","r"
98935,"I maybe would recommend but only if the other courses being taken by the student are not too difficult.","neu"
98935,"If you want to take more proof-based math, then yes. Otherwise, this class is not really worth the time and effort spent learning the abstract and complicated material.","r"
98935,"If you have to take it, then make sure you get the right professor and read the textbook. Otherwise, there is absolutely zero reason to take this course.","neu"
98935,"I felt like I had no support in MATH225. If I hadn't already known a fair share of my classmates, I would have been doing the problem sets totally alone and really struggling to do so. Problem sessions and office hours weren't designed around help on problem sets and didn't help my understanding of the material.","dr"
98935,"Yes, it is a beautiful way to discover mathematics","r"
98935,"No.","dr"
98935,"I would like to recommend this course, but would only do so on the proviso that there are actual, accessible office hours. The fact that these were exclusively held during normal class times (like between 11-1pm) and were so few and far between meant seeking help was extremely difficult. The decision to hold the TA session on a Friday morning wasn't wise, and then to move it to 5-7pm once per week - straight after the main ULA session and covering the whole dining hours - was no better. The ULA workshops turned into frantic P-set help sessions and undermined their entire purpose. Without a change in this structure, I could not recommend 225 to anyone who doesn't *need* to take it.","neu"
98935,"Yes, I would recommend this to a student who enjoys math.","r"
98935,"Yes, especially if you plan on taking more proof-based math classes. It wasnt super heavy on proofs and had a good mix of computational problems and proofs.","r"
98935,"I don't think I would as an introduction to proof writing. It took me a while to actually gain a grasp of how to construct a mathematical proof, but I feel this course sort of throws you right into it with little support, making the first evaluations and psets particularly challenging if you don't have prior proof experience or access to friends or resources that can help you outside of class.","dr"
98935,"Yes! If you are interested in math or other QRs.","r"
98935,"I would not recommend this course to another student unless they need it as a major requirement.","dr"
98935,"No, I would not. I came into Yale loving math and this course unfortunately crushed a lot of that.","dr"
98935,"Yes, it is foundational to higher level math.","r"
98935,"Yes really teaches you how to think.","r"
98935,"Yes, if you're interested in finding out what proof-based math looks like and are willing to put in the work for a course which will give you knowledge that you won't know how to apply right away. I feel like I learned a bunch of random but related math stuff this semester, and I don't know if or when I will ever use that knowledge. But it's a great experience intellectually and if you're the kind of learner who likes learning for its own sake and would rather learn something interesting and useless over something boring and useful, you will like this course. (obviously the useful/uselessness is not that extreme, but I do think I'm the former kind of learner and that's why I enjoyed it).","r"
98935,"If you want to try a proof based math class, yes! The proofs are not incredibly challenging, but still difficult. Linear algebra is also very interesting, so I recommend taking this or MATH 222.","r"
98935,"Yes, if you need it for your major or truly, absolutely, love proofs and math.","r"
98935,"If you are interested in learning about higher math and want a heavy workload, proof-based course, then yes! If you are a math major, this course will set you up very well for future math classes. However, if you are just taking this course to learn linear algebra or take a fun math class, I probably wouldn't take it. I often found myself becoming incredibly stressed out about the homeworks and exams, and I wish the class had a stronger support system of help. If there were more office hours, especially with the ULA's, that would have made this class more manageable.","r"
98935,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in mathematics or an adjacent field of study. The course is well organized, its expectations are clear, and although the material is quite theoretical I found it rather thought-provoking. I also felt that all three instructors were truly invested in the class' success.","r"
98935,"Yes because linear algebra is very important.","r"
98935,"I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in more theoretical math or if they are trying to figure out if they want to pursue more theoretical math because I think that taking this course is a good way to figure that out if you're not sure. If a student knows that they explicitly do not want to pursue more theoretical math and they don't need this course for any particular requirement, then I would strongly recommend that they take MATH 222 instead.","r"
98935,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I learned a lot and fell in love with proof-based math, which I very much was not expecting.","r"
98935,"Yes, I like the first question of every assignment and how it teaches you how to think about learning. Very good introductory course.","r"
98935,"Only if it was required for their major. If not, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class.","neu"
98935,"I took this course because it is a requirement for my major. For anyone who is not required to take this course and is also interested in Linear Algebra, I would advise them to take 222, a class more focused on doing Linear Algebra and exploring it's applications.","neu"
98935,"Yes if you need to take it.","r"
98935,"Depends if they organize better.","neu"
98935,"If you have to for a requirement, then yes.","neu"
98935,"I would only recommend this course if you are a math or cs major who requires the introduction to proofs. If you are taking this class only to learn the mechanics of linear algebra, I would not recommend it as the class almost requires you to learn all the material on your own and goes into more detail than most learning linear algebra will need when first being introduced.","neu"
98935,"Yes, definitely take this over 222.","r"
98935,"I would recommend this course to another student deeply interested in theoretical math and interested in devoting large amounts of time to studying the course material, completing problem sets, and attending office hours. The course is rewarding and enriching, but has a very sizeable workload, and due to the amount of material and new math strategies being introduced, can take longer to comprehend compared to other courses. Overall, the course was both very interesting and very challenging.","r"
98936,"I would recommend this course to another student. It is a prerequisite to many classes and majors and is generally very interesting and enjoyable. The grading scheme does seem very tough, though as you need >95% to guarantee an A. Hopefully, they modify it to make it more lenient. Definitely use LaTeX on the problem sets. It's super easy to use, saves so much time, and makes your proofs cleaner and more readable. Very much worth learning.","r"
98936,"It is badly structured, the instructors can barely teach, and the office hours are useless--they become group study sessions instead. The psets are difficult--more difficult the week after exams for some reason?--and so are some of the exams. The course does not facilitate learning--after a while I was reading through their solutions, trying to figure out what they wanted because even if you know the answer, you won't know how to write it the way they want you to write it because they don't tell you but expect you to know regardless and will take off points for the smallest things. And, then they have bullshit and pretentious first questions on psets where you're supposed to read articles or watch videos about the beauty of math and how best to learn math well when they are single handedly destroying any love I had for math--and I did like math quite a bit, wanted to take more than was required for my major. Not after this. If you don't absolutely need a proof-based class, I would strongly recommend going for 222 instead.","dr"
98936,"Yes! I really enjoyed this course and it's the reason I've decided to become a math major. Just be prepared to put a fair amount of effort into the p-sets.","r"
98936,"Maybe the structure and the proof of all learned concepts was good, but homework needed more support.","neu"
98936,"No, linear algebra is not taught until the 3rd month, the homework is almost always disconnected from what you learned in class and is often explicitly designed for you to teach yourself some concept by figuring out a proof. While this is sometimes a good method of teaching, the delayed feedback on the homework makes it so I never actually figured out if was right because by the time I got the grade bike we were on a different unit. The office hours were also not helpful for getting review or help on the pset, instead they just gave you a set of more problems to do and then sat in silence.","dr"
98936,"Only if you are required to take it. Take 222 by every means necessary (especially if you already have proof experience).","dr"
98936,"I would definitely recommend this course to any other students who enjoy math. MATH 225 is the class that really wanted to make me continue with math in college.","r"
98938,"Yes. Some probability theory is a pretty hard prereq; taking it without was pretty difficult for the first few weeks","r"
98938,"ABSOLUTELY, Robert Wooster is an amazing professor, super kind and understanding, and actually teaches the content in an understandable way compared to some older professors.","r"
98938,"I would only recommend this to student who are in the major/doing the certificate, as it is not an easy class. Professor Wooster is very good at explaining the material, this course was a lot better experience than S&DS 241 with Professor Wu.","r"
98938,"Yes, I definitely learned a lot","r"
98938,"Only if you're doing the BS in statistics. If you're an applied math or pure math major, this class isn't worth the time and effort you need to put in, unless you're genuinely interested in learning about why t tests or confidence intervals work the way they do, or other concepts you would see in 230 or AP Stats. The homework isn't bad, but 242 requires you to completely understand the concepts from class and be able to apply them, which requires spending a lot more time than you would expect digesting the material. Doing well in 241 is also not a good indicator of how well you'll do in 242.","neu"
98938,"I would only recommend this if it is required, because the workload and challenge is extreme. However, you will learn a lot.","r"
98938,"If you are really interested in the subject or have a knack for statistics, go for it. But it is not for the faint of heart and prepared to study.","r"
98938,"Yes! I think it provides a great foundation for statistics which can be applied to several other classes","r"
98938,"Yes, I would strongly recommend the course. Wooster does an excellent job teaching the content in an approachable way; though, the course expects mathematical maturity (strong calculus esp). I feel much more confident using statistical models/inference (e.g. t-tests, chi-sq tests, bayesian stats). I took S&DS 238 before and felt very prepared for this course (slight catching up in terms of probability at the beginning, but very quickly, the stats focus in 238 aids you).","r"
98938,"If you're a stats major or applied math, then I'd reccommend the class.","r"
98938,"Yes, especially if Bob Wooster is teaching it","r"
98938,"Yes.","r"
98938,"If you are interested in statistics and are willing to take a more deeply mathematical approach, absolutely!","r"
98938,"I would recommend it to other students because this course introduced concepts of techniques of important statistical methods.","r"
98938,"Yes, if they need to fulfill the requirement for statistical theory","r"
98938,"If they like math approach to stats","r"
98938,"I recommend SDS 242 if you would like to take any advanced stats course (machine learning, advanced probability, etc.) as it provides the mathematical basis for future classes.","r"
98938,"I took this course because I was required to as part of my degree. I generally wouldn't recommend it because I think it is really tough and for most people I think an applied statistics course is a better option. However, it does give you a foundation of some theory that you will need if you actually want to be a statistician. If the goal is not to be a statistician then choose an applied class.","neu"
98938,"Yes. A must-take for those interested in statistics.","r"
98938,"No, unless they need it for their major. Even so, I might look at other options. The course is very difficult.","dr"
98938,"no homework too many","dr"
98938,"yes","r"
98938,"It is the foundation before niche applications of statistics in any field.","r"
98938,"Yes","r"
98938,"Yes! I think 242 is very well-taught for being a challenging course. Probably one of the most valuable courses to take in S&DS","r"
98938,"Yes if you want to learn some theory behind some stats topics you've heard of throughout your academia. Professors make or break the course. You definitely want to be taking stats with Bob. Bob sets a high standard for teaching talent. I tried to nominate Bob for the teaching prizes but it said that the professor had to have worked at Yale for at least three years, so you guys better nominate Bob in two years. Bob made lessons very illustrative and clear with constant examples and interweaving proofs and problems to great effect. Like an ideal math professor, Bob literally clarified almost everything he wrote down in the course, which proved super helpful during lengthy derivations. His notes were absolutely great, and he would always hand write them and update them timely. He always made a point to make sure everyone was up to speed and regularly solicited questions. Bob also did a great job constantly referencing topics from other lectures in a different lecture and tying similar topics together, which made understanding the context of a topic in the statistics universe a lot easier. He provided practice problems very relevant to exam content and difficulty, lots of supplementary information like illustrative examples in R, and held literally four office hours per week what the. Bob was elegant and quick on his feet when answering student questions, delivering them well formulated responses. He is kind, humble, welcoming, funny, responsive, and overall a great guy, one of my top three professors at Yale out of probably like 50 I've had. Yale's other STEM professors (especially math and stats, jeez) would do well to take a page out of Bob's book, and he is the ideal exact kind of new professor that will ensure Yale maintains its academic edge into the future.  The only weakness is that Bob is not teaching other courses that I want to take! (inference and machine learning and advanced probability) because the current professors leave much to be desired. I wish I could learn machine learning from Bob, this man would carry me into the future of AI. Did you read this review??? Give this man a promotion and a raise!!","r"
98938,"I would absolutely recommend this course, especially for S&DS Majors. Especially after having taken one of S&DS 238 or S&DS 241, you will have a strong knowledge base for this class yet 242 has very little overlap, so you still explore and learn many different concepts in statistics.","r"
98938,"Definitely would recommend to stat majors, because it is a prerequisite for a lot of other interesting electives for the major.","r"
98938,"I took this CR/D/F as a non-stats major and still had a lot of fun!!","r"
98938,"Yes. The instructor is so good at teaching and the materials are very useful for future research.","r"
98938,"I would because it's required for the B.S","r"
98938,"Absolutely! The statistical inference content is applicable in a wide variety of disciplines.","r"
98938,"If you have to take S&DS 242 for the major, I would definitely recommend taking it with Professor Wooster over other professors! Its absolutely a fundamental course in understanding statistics, and anyone interested in data science should absolutely take it rather than skipping to the application classes.","r"
98938,"The class is very theory-heavy, so only take this course if it is required for your major/prerequisite for other classes or if you are genuinely interested in learning the theory behind statistical methods.","neu"
98938,"Yes, but only if you want to do research using statistical methods.","r"
98938,"If they need it for the stats major then yes","r"
98938,"I don't think so. This class was hard and not very fun","dr"
98938,"Yes, its a good introductory course to basic stats concepts like MLE estimates or constructing confidence intervals and really gets you familiar with stats notation and how stats thinking differs from traditional math fields. It definitely makes me feel more confident taking harder stats classes in the future.","r"
98938,"I would recommend this course to another student because I believe it gave me an understanding of the foundation of statistics.","r"
98938,"Yes, if you want to dive into stat","r"
98938,"Yes, good for theoretical understanding of statistics","r"
98938,"Don't take this class if you're not a stats major. Literally no reason. There are plenty more interesting math courses.","dr"
98938,"Yes!","r"
98938,"Yes if you are a stats major, of course. Could be an ok elective too.","r"
98938,"No. Do not take this course unless you need it.","dr"
98938,"yes, very good professor","r"
98938,"Yes, especially if Professor Wooster is teaching.","r"
98938,"Yes, the professor is wonderful. Really cares about his students and learning.","r"
98938,"Yeah, if youre a SDS major. Its pretty conceptual stuff, so if youre just doing the certificate Im not sure this one is needed. 241 is probably more useful.","r"
98938,"Yes, even if youre not a stats major (im a CS major), if you are more quantitative","r"
98938,"I'd recommend this course to any student majoring in statistics, applied math, pure math, or computer science. It's a great introduction to some really important statistical methods. The computation is a bit heavy and some of the content is a bit theoretical, so be prepared for that.","r"
98938,"Yes, but it will be difficult.","r"
98938,"I didnt love the course but I guess its important to understand the derivations of the fundamental statistical tests. Most people already know a lot of this, though. Professor Wooster is nice.","neu"
98938,"Yes, I would! Specifically if taught by Dr. Wooster. He's a very clear teacher and you learn in a very coherent order about how to identify parameters, test hypotheses, and apply that in linear regression. The R component was also helpful.","r"
98938,"This course is pretty essential to both S&DS and math majors, so I would definitely recommend for students in either major.","r"
98938,"Yes. The topics covered are crucial in statistics","r"
98938,"No, the material is hard on its own and Bob doesn't have the right teaching philosophy or methods to make the material easier to understand. Lectures are useless and your best bet is the textbook.","dr"
98938,"I would recommend it if you're interested in stats and want to understand more about the inner workings of how common stats methods work.","r"
98938,"It's quite difficult but it will give you important information. Do not take this if you are not a stats major, data science certificate candidate, or someone who is very quantitative by nature.","dr"
98938,"Certainly","r"
98938,"If you have interest in the derivation of tests and why test statistics fall under some distribution, take this. It might be good to already have experience dealing with estimation / error analysis in the context of labs or projects so that the hypothesis tests that are taught would seem actually relevant. Otherwise it might be rather dry.","neu"
98938,"Yeah, for stats majors. It's a difficult course and the material isn't the most interesting, but unlike 241, this one is very well taught. The tests and homeworks are not terrible.","r"
98938,"too good","r"
98938,"Nice intro stats","r"
98938,"Most boring stats class of all time. Love you Rob, but it wasn't enough.","dr"
98938,"Yes. This course provides a general view of statistics and everything taught is very helpful.","r"
98938,"Yes, if you want a good overview of statistics this is a good choice, not too heavy of a workload and the professor is very good","r"
98938,"I would. It is so comprehensive, and I feel like I understand statistics so much better than before. I made my brain work!","r"
98938,"Maybe, since this is the fundation course for a student major in math","neu"
98938,"Yes, I think it is a great course to learn more about proper statistical practices and the applications are also very nice to see","r"
98938,"Yes. I took this course after having previously taken an introduction to statistics overview course previously and this course provides more in-depth and nuts-and-bolts understanding of concepts that get just an overview in the introduction course. For someone wanting to use or engage with statistics and statistical reporting in their career, this kind of theoretical course is a valuable opportunity to understand the subject beyond simple rules of thumb as often presented in intro courses.","r"
98938,"Yes, statistics is very relevant in todays world","r"
98938,"Yes! I walk away with better intuition on fundamental topics in statistics and working with samples. It's not a class where you learn how to do research in R on an arbitrary dataset. Instead, you hopefully gain the ability to explain and justify the steps in such a research task and be precise in your definitions.","r"
98938,"Yes, it is fundamental for learning statistics.","r"
98938,"yes, excellent","r"
98938,"I found it really boring, but that is okay its not too hard.","neu"
98939,"Yes, if you need an easy math class.","r"
98939,"For a light workload credit sure Otherwise probably not cause it's pretty boring and unengaging","neu"
98939,"No, just take the ENAS version unless the course is completely reworked. It's more trouble than its worth and you will regret having taken this class, during classtime and especially during the exams.  If an administrator sat in on this class they would be shocked that this was a class taught at Yale University. I wonder whether I should've just taken the course another local New Haven college or online.","dr"
98939,"Only if you're really interested in ODEs or need it for some requirement. I didn't need the course for anything and took it as a 5th credit however this was not the wisest decision. The material gets harder as you progress and the midterm is basically a speed run which can be very stressful even if you know all the material going in. Lectures weren't super exciting as Professor Montcrief usually just writes notes from a notepad onto the board for you to take down and learn the material. I would say don't take the course if you do not really need to.","neu"
98939,"I would recommend this in so far as it is fundamental. But maybe consider taking another course in differential equations if it is on offer.","r"
98939,"It is a very nice non-proof-based math course with weekly PSETs. Prof. Moncrief's two exams were fair--but hard--because they took much longer than the allotted time in class (i.e. around 60 min) so they are hard to finish within time.","r"
98939,"Only if you need it for the major.","neu"
98939,"Not really unless a different professor is teaching it, because you'll have to teach yourself the material and you probably won't like this class and won't go to lecture, and then you won't do that well on exams because it's just impossible to finish them in time.","dr"
98939,"If you need a math credit or are interested in ODEs then it is a pretty chill way to learn about it. I enjoyed having the chance to do some computational math after a lot of proof-based classes.","neu"
98939,"No, take 194 or just learn it by yourself. The textbook Boyce Di Prima is easily accessible and basically everybody uses it. It's probably just best if you self learn.","dr"
98939,"Generally its taken as a less intensive math class as a way to fulfill a requirement. If youre looking for that, this will do the job. Not too challenging and honestly pretty interesting. At times instruction was a little unclear but for the most part, it was self-explanatory and was made clear by the professor. I think there were some practical issues with the course (2 whiteboards) which really slowed down the learning but that was out of the Professors control, and I imagine that will be taken care of.","neu"
98939,"I found myself not always attending lecture because it was either difficult to understand the professor or I wasn't sure of what material would be covered in class. I was just a bit lost during the course. For those reasons, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class for students who are trying to develop a rigorous understanding of differential equations. Although, for students who are interested in some of the aspects of differential equations (perhaps more so on the analytic rather than computational side) this might be a better choice than the ENAS class.","neu"
98939,"Do not take this class unless you have to for your major.","dr"
98939,"Yes, if Professor Moncrief is not teaching it.","r"
98939,"Yeah go for it! It's not a class you'll remember in ten years, but it's useful for a lot of things and it has a chill workload. I took this as a fifth class when a different one I wanted ended up conflicting, and I don't regret my decision. It was a nice way to brush up on calculus in a low-stress environment. Exams are open-book and open-note with integrals written on the board (though that didn't keep the second exam from being the only BRUTAL part of the class - a total curveball). I'm still optimistic that there was a generous curve, and combined with the homeworks being very easy to check (you can just plug your solution back into the differential equation) it's not hard at all to do well in the class. Professor Moncrief is also a legend, you gotta go to his lectures. So much deadpan humor. You won't regret it.","r"
98939,"Not unless you need it. Homework is lots and lots of tedious algebra with little insight. Lectures are worse than what you'll find on YouTube.","dr"
98939,"I would recommend this course to another student interested in expanding their knowledge of computational math with some applications.","r"
98940,"absolutely recommend if you get a chance to take it with Neitzke. this class made me fall in love with pure math. beware of the exams though they can be pretty tough.","r"
98940,"It's a req for math and many math related majors, and for those students it's a nice course even if not a req. There are many interesting topics covered, a lot of things learned and overall is pretty hands-on material which I think many may find interesting.","r"
98940,"Yes, take it. If you are doing STEM, QUANT, or anything, you need to take it. I would suggest you to go through Rudin's principles of mathematical analysis before attending class though","r"
98940,"I would recommend this course for anyone interested in math, it is really beautiful to formulate Calculus from the ground up! Can you really trust Calc I & II? This course allows you to trust the things you are given in those courses. All together, a great intro to the math major!","r"
98940,"This was by far the most interesting and insightful math course I have ever taken. I feel like I have a far better general understanding of mathematics following Analysis 1. Anyone with any mathematical interest should take this course, even if it is not a major requirement in any way. It is absolutely worth taking proof-based linear algebra beforehand just so you can take analysis.","r"
98940,"Yes, best math class I have taken at Yale.","r"
98940,"Yes, if you are relatively comfortable with proof-based math and want to improve your mathematical understanding, this is a great course to take.","r"
98940,"Very well-taught and organized course that will give you a great understanding of the material. Definitely be prepared to work hard, as the class moves fast and psets could be time-consuming. Would certainly recommend, even to non-math majors! Many people take this class after linear (225), and while the proof-based nature was the same I will offer a warning that the content of the class is very different. The ""type"" of math, and types of proof, change a lot between linear and analysis, and I found analysis much harder, although I'm sure it's different for everyone.","r"
98940,"I would recommend other students to take this course because it certainly helps improve one's proof writing and critical thinking skills.","r"
98940,"Absolutely! Anyone who is interested in math or proof-writing (and not only math majors)!","r"
98940,"I would definitely recommend this course. It is quite an interesting class, and professor Neitzke is an extremely good teacher.","r"
98940,"Would recommend, especially with an organized prof like Neitzke! In fact would recommend any course with Neitzke but that's getting off track. You need an inspiring prof to teach you analysis - if you get bored in lecture, consider dropping and taking it another semester (I dropped 255 in a previous semester and took it again with Neitzke). Math 255 is like the gateway drug to math, so you really want a good prof for this one.","r"
98940,"Absolutely--especially if it's being taught by Professor Neitzke. You will develop strong proof skills while learning cool material. Essentially, at the beginning of the course, you're taught what a real number is, and by the end of it, you've proven single-variable calculus! It's amazing.","r"
98940,"If you are not looking to major in pure math but enjoy math, I would audit the course or take it C/D/F. It was very interesting and made me appreciate math more than Linear did, for example. It made me much better at writing and brainstorming proofs, and I think made me a more patient, thoughtful, and better student. The psets and exams are hard, but they push you to improve.","neu"
98940,"I definitely would! I found it very interesting, and I learned a lot about math. It was a challenge, but definitely a rewarding challenge.","r"
98940,"I would certainly recommend this course. Analysis and topology seem like really interesting fields, and this is a strong introduction to both. Professors Neitzke and McAdams are both fantastic, and very supportive and helpful. One word of warning is that the material got significantly more difficult in the second half of the course, so be ready for that!","r"
98940,"I would! For anyone interested in mathematics or proofs, this class is super super interesting, and I learned so much in it! Every lecture was dense and packed with content.","r"
98940,"This course is another great introduction to proof-based mathematics. It builds well upon Math 225 but is not too much more demanding. I would only take this course if you're interested in proofs; the goal of the course is to define the limit, derivative, and integral using very rigorous language you probably already know these concepts informally. I nonetheless really enjoyed the course.","r"
98940,"If you are interested in analysis, take the course.","r"
98940,"Yes, if you are a STEM major or if youre interested in math at all. You get a new perspective on topics youve probably seen before, and itll change how you think about math.","r"
98940,"Yes! Great way to learn more about math!","r"
98940,"I would recommend this course to students who need this as a requirement or who are interested in exploring pure math (or know they already enjoy it). I think Professor Neitzke really made this class for me; Im not the biggest real analysis fan but I do love pure math, and the course was nice. If you can take it with Neitzke, it is definitely worth it. As a course in it if itself, it was a great comprehensive introduction to analysis and you will come out with strong fundamentals.","r"
98940,"I think this course does some things well and obviously is a requirement for the Math major (or 256 as an alternative). However, I would recommend being aware that this course is pretty challenging and probably not all that interesting unless you are really interested in mathematics.","r"
98940,"This was an awesome course! You make rigorous a lot of the concepts that you have already learned in calculus with the addition of sets (my favorite topic) amongst other things like countability, metric spaces, compactness. It's approachable as you will have intuition on a lot of these topics from calculus classes, but Professor Neitzke does a great job of making you understand the intuition behind ideas and setting things up. One of the most important resources for this class is Professor Neitzke's notes (which are digitalized nicely), and the ULAs are also wonderful.   In terms of structure of the course: we have two midterms plus a final exam, and 12 psets (which was a bit ambitious) we would have shorter psets on weeks we had our midterms.  Professor Neitzke is also extremely accommodating and interested in your wellbeing, so definitely reach out to him if you have any questions or ever need help!","r"
98940,"I would recommend this course to any student who wants to take higher level math courses. This is a key stepping stone for the mathematical sequence, and it will help you become a better proof writer.","r"
98940,"Yes! Especially with Neitzke! He will change the way you think about math!","r"
98940,"Yes, interesting material","r"
98940,"Yes! If not for the math, it teaches you a new way of thinking about problems.","r"
98940,"Yes! I think everyone should have to take this! I wish there was a less intimidating version for non-stem students, it filled me with awe!","r"
98940,"Yes, especially with Neitzke","r"
98940,"Yes, its a good course if you want to be challenged and know more about logic and proofs.","r"
98941,"not unless its required for your major or you're really interested in proofs","dr"
98941,"I would, but only if necessary to continue mathematics. Analysis is challenging, especially if you're coming from a background without proof-based learning/teaching, and I benefitted from taking MATH 225 and 244 in the same year.","r"
98941,"Yes if you like Math, because it teaches you rigorous pure math techniques and once it clicks you start appreciating Math a lot more.","r"
98941,"Yes. It is required for many things, but even aside from that, it's an interesting course in pure math (very little application). Both Professor McAdam and Neitzke are great at teaching this course.","r"
98941,"Yes! However, this course will unfortunately not be taught by the same professors next year so it may be different in the future.","r"
98941,"Absolutely. The best math class I've taken so far and the professors clearly care about their students. Just be prepared because it gets much harder as the semester goes by.","r"
98941,"I would only take this course if you intend to continue on the route of theoretical math.","r"
98941,"Good course if youre interested in analysis or need it for your major but not if youre just trying out proof based math for the first time","r"
98941,"Yes, especially as a math student if you want cool puzzles everyday.","r"
98941,"yes for non math majors as well","r"
98941,"I would recommend it, to hone your proof skills and learn about an interesting area of math.","r"
98941,"yes analysis is fundemental","r"
98941,"Yes","r"
98941,"Yes, I think this is an excellent course to learn about how to think about math. It may help when working in theory, but in general it can help also in applied work","r"
98941,"Absolutely, anyone interested in any subject that involves proofs and logical thinking must take a similar course.","r"
98941,"I would recommend this course to anyone interested in pursuing higher level math. It seemed like it was a great introduction to proof based math classes and the type of thinking they require.","r"
98943,"Yes, every math major should take this class.","r"
98943,"Yes! MATH 305 is historically very well taught at Yale.","r"
98943,"If you're interested in doing more proof-based math, and would like to see some cool analysis just for the fun of it, this is the course for you.","r"
98943,"Yes. Hee Oh is very good at explaining challenging concepts. I think if the course were a little better organized it could be much better though. Sometimes in lectures Professor Oh would get confused and then the lecture would become borderline impossible to follow. I think perhaps if the lectures were better prepared/organized in advance it'd be a much better experience. Overall though, Hee Oh is great at explaining the material","r"
98943,"Yes! It's a fun class to learn fundamental topics in real analysis. It's a good subject to know; parts of it are dry, but other parts are really intuitive and satisfying.","r"
98943,"If you are interested in analysis or measure theory, or just want a cool math class, then definitely! Be prepared to put in the work.","r"
98943,"Yes, its great for those considering math or statistics majors","r"
98943,"Definitely. Professor Oh is fantasticvery clear lecturer, kind person, funnyand the material is cool. Take it.","r"
98943,"Without a doubt yes. I came into this class disliking analysis and liking algebra more, and I left loving analysis much more than algebra. Hee Oh is the best lecturer I have ever had and is very effective at explaining how something is proved and why it is important.","r"
98943,"Yes for math majors","r"
98943,"Yes, I think every math major should take this class! Even if you don't like analysis much (I don't), I think a basic understanding of measure theory is important, and the Fourier series stuff at the end is pretty cool. Also, Prof. Oh is one of the best lecturers in the department, so definitely take a class with her if you can!","r"
98943,"No. If I could have dropped it, I would have. But if youre a math major, I would recommend taking a solid Analysis 1 or self-studying beforehand.","dr"
98943,"Yes, it Challenged me in a Way I really appreciated.","r"
98943,"If you are a math major interested in analysis, absolutely. Honestly, I don't think you should be allowed to graduate as a math major without taking this course, because it builds a lot of mathematical maturity regardless of its subject matter.","r"
98943,"Yes, analysis is very fun and the course threaded the needle of being clear enough that I could understand the topics and do most of the homework on my own or with friends, but challenging enough that I had to put a lot of thought into it.","r"
98943,"Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, analysis will become your queen.","r"
98943,"Yes! If you are interested in pure math this is an excellent choice.","r"
98943,"Yes, if only for the Fourier analysis part of the course (the last 1/4 or so of the course) and the pleasure of Professor Oh's lectures. Make sure you have friends taking the class with you to study and work with; the lack of resources or review sessions means you'll need a study group.","r"
98943,"You have to take it, so you have to take it.","neu"
98946,"I would recommend this course to other math majors, but probably not to anyone outside of that.","neu"
98946,"yes","r"
98946,"If you are someone who skips class a lot, or is happy to learn from the textbook, then yes. The material is cool, and Kenyon is one of the nicest professors I've had. Definitely one of the easier math major classes I've taken.","r"
98946,"Yes, but only if you have consistent time to do a lot of thinking and work every week to actually understand all concepts/definitions and built a solid intuition. The course builds upon itself and basically snowballs definitions and theorems up to very complicated results so if you fall behind it will take a lot of time and work to catch up","r"
98946,"I personally did not enjoy this course, but to someone who is very interested in the subject matter of groups and rings, and abstracting algebra, this would be a good course to take. The main issue is that it was taught in Watson at 9am (I do not live in Murray or Frankin).","dr"
98946,"Go for it. Make sure you have some friends in the class as some of the psets can be long.","r"
98946,"If you are not a math major, then don't bother. But if you are, then this course is one of the most essential courses you can take.","neu"
98946,"I think abstract algebra is a fascinating topics, and its a must-take for anyone who is interested in more advanced math courses. I would recommend this course to any student who is looking for an interesting and challenging math course.","r"
98946,"Yes, abstract algebra is very interesting and shows up all over the place in other areas of math as well.","r"
98946,"Absolutely. This made me love algebra as a previously solely analysis fan.","r"
98946,"Definitely. Professor Kenyons Math 350 is an incredibly well-taught course that opens up doors to a beautiful field of math. Professor Kenyons inspiring, encouraging nature will constantly challenge you to be the sharpest mathematician you can. I cant wait to take Math 310 with Professor Kenyon in the fall; he is a natural teacher who I feel lucky to have the opportunity to learn from.","r"
98946,"Definitely a harder math class, but if you can commit a solid effort into it, it will definitely pay off for anyone who is very curious about mathematics.","r"
98946,"Yes, if they're interested in math! It certainly pushed me intellectually.","r"
98948,"Yes, if you feel like you have a very strong group theory (350) background. I struggled sometimes because I missed things from group theory that were important.","r"
98948,"Yes, particularly if the course is taught by Miki. The course is an excellent sequel to MATH 350, to understand some of the more interesting and concrete applications of abstract algebra.","r"
98948,"Yes, it is a wonderful course covering interesting material. It is taught excellently with great student support.","r"
98948,"I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in algebra and enjoyed the computational aspects of MATH 350.","r"
98948,"Very fun class to follow up on MATH 350.","r"
98948,"nice course, intro to Galois correspondence","r"
98948,"Its brutal, but if you want to understand the material you will need to put in the work in general. Only would recommend to math majors.","neu"
98948,"Yes, absolutely. The course requires commitment to be sure; you have to review a lot of Math 350 material during the course if you had forgotten it. It is, however, extremely rewarding. It is a beautiful area of math that answers a lot of questions about polynomials that I had since high school. Also, Miki is a fantastic instructor. Highly recommend.","r"
98948,"Yes, if you have the time to put into it and are able/willing to be awake for the 9am. The content is pretty cool. I'm a big Eisenstein fan idk.","r"
98948,"If youre considering it, absolutely take it. Truly one of if not the best math courses Ive taken.","r"
98948,"In a heartbeat! I have friends who thought they didn't like algebra, but even they had to admit that it was a really cool class! Plus, it's a kind of standard bearer for how abstract math can connect back to more elementary problems, like why there's no quintic formula, or what regular n-gons you can construct with a compass and straightedge---these examples come up in a lot of popular math sources and it's nice to explore them rigorously.","r"
98948,"Yes, esp. for math majors.","r"
98948,"If it's with Miki, take it.","r"
98948,"Yes! It's a very pretty bit of math, and is deeply satisfying, especially once you've taken 350.","r"
98948,"YES, it's quite rewarding after having taken abstract algebra and it's a fun and chill class.","r"
98948,"Yes!! Take all the Miki classes that you can! She really makes it clear why we are doing what we are doing, as well as the motivations for solving certain things which otherwise can be pretty obscure in mathematics.","r"
98948,"Yes, this class is a great introduction to Galois theory.","r"
98948,"Yes, if you are interested in polynomials and field theory. This class also opens up some other algebra related classes.","r"
98948,"Definitely to anyone who has taken 350, even if they didn't take it with Miki. I did 350 three semesters before 370, yet I find Miki's 370 still very accessible because Miki will tell you what theorems from 350 are most likely to be used and you will not be too pressured to go back and review everything from 350. Also, 370 is less abstract and tedious than 350 in that everything is very natural -- once you understand the theorem you will be able to get the answer within a few lines without too much calculation, and field extensions are something easier to visualize than group structures. I think many things from 370 are cool and interesting to learn (for example, why some quintic equations have no radical solutions while all quartic ones do).","r"
98948,"Definitely! If you've taken 350, take this class. I thought it was really fun and more intuitive than many other math classes, and it was cool to see how techniques/knowledge from 350 actually came in handy! Also, the workload is manageable -- psets are not too bad, and the tests were very fair (with Miki at least -- take any class with Miki).","r"
98948,"Absolutely! Miki is WONDERFUL, the math is quite beautiful, and the class is extremely well organized. I found the lectures to be very fast, but I'm also a slower thinker than most. This is definitely where all the grinding of 350 pays off.","r"
98948,"Definitely, especially if Miki is teaching it! Like MATH 350, it is a lot of work, but it is really rewarding and the support from Miki is super helpful. The material is really interesting and fun to work with.","r"
98948,"YES. Galois theory is really fun, and applying all the group theory and ring theory you learned in 350 to it really helps you bolster your understanding of all three of these things. Also, you should take any course Miki teaches. I might not recommend it if you wouldn't have much time to devote to this course; while it's less work than Math 350 with Miki was, it's still quite a lot.","r"
98950,"Probably. I wish we talked about some applications or connections. What we learned was a subset of the first 4 chapters of the textbook (which was still quite a lot to be fair).","neu"
98950,"I would recommend this course for its content, but only if the grader was different.","r"
98950,"Yes, the content is quite interesting, especially if you are also interested in physics.","r"
98950,"Unless you have a clear passion for differential geometry and know a place where it can be applied, the course is not really worth it. If youre just merely curious, save yourself the headache of dealing with the grader and covering all topics at lightning speed by just reading the textbook. It is relatively well written and very visual (do Carmo differential geometry).","neu"
98950,"Yes! This course really made me fall in love with geometry. I have heard that the content/direction of the course does vary somewhat based on the prof teaching it, but still would recommend since my sense is that there aren't many other geometry courses targeted towards undergrads at Yale. (Of course, if geometry isn't your thing, then maybe not, but still.)","r"
98950,"I would recommend this class! The results in differential geometry are very interesting, and I enjoyed the psets. It's pretty low-workload compared to other math classes at a comparable level -- we had five psets, a midterm, and a final exam.","r"
98950,"Yes! Cool material and Prof. Park is very kind and a clear instructor.","r"
98957,"I would to a non-science major who needs a science credit, which is how the course is advertised.","r"
98957,"Yes, good course to take for non stem majors","r"
98957,"No, I would not recommend this course to another student. Studying for exams (there are three midterms) requires significantly more time than expected and does not translate into better scores, as 95% of the course is just memorizing and regurgitating information.","dr"
98957,"Super easy. Would recommend. Make sure you study for the exams, but they are not that bad.","r"
98957,"I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a science credit and is curious about the material. This is not a work intensive course, and you can engage with it as much or as little as you like.","r"
98957,"Yes I would, it wasn't a class that caused me major stress, but I also feel I learned a great deal.","r"
98957,"It is somewhat of an easy science credit for those with no prior experience in college level science. I did not feel like I needed to have taken AP Bio before taking this class. The exams do require a fair amount of studying beforehand and some of the lecturers are not the best at expressing the main points that students will need to know. Overall, if you need a science credit I would say take it.","r"
98957,"I would recommend this course only if someone either has a background in basic biology already or is really good at memorizing details. The exams are very detail oriented, and you need to be able to write down more specific details rather than just the basis of how processes work.","r"
98957,"Not if this student is looking to take a science course for non-science majors. Some of the information was useful for anyone which is what I was looking for in this course, but some of the information that was taught was hard to understand for any non-science major and I don't feel like I need to know it whatsoever.","dr"
98957,"Yes if you want a science credit that's not much work besides 3 exams.","r"
98957,"Yes, interesting and not too difficult","r"
98957,"yes","r"
98957,"Yes! If you are a non-STEM major this is definitely the class for you. As someone in a humanities major with no background in science, it was pretty engaging and interesting, even when I did have to put in some work to understand the more scientific side of things. I honestly enjoyed it.","r"
98957,"Yes! This was a wonderful survey course in recent Biological topics. I also thoroughly enjoyed the experimental science section, which allowed us to take part in various scientific endeavours around campus.","r"
98957,"Yes, good science course and broad range of topics covered.","r"
98957,"Yes! This is a great science course for non-science students, but only if youre willing to put in the effort","r"
98957,"I would only recommend this course to students who want an easy GUT science credit and students who are interested in biology. I don't think I would take this course again because I'm not that interested in biology and I think I could have found a different course to fulfill a science credit which I found more interesting.","neu"
98957,"This is not a gut. If you want to do well, you need to study for exams. However, if you keep up with the class, it is very easy to be successful. There is no final exam which is great. A lot of the content r like climate change and Covid is already known in general so there will be less studying there.","neu"
98957,"Yes and no. I am neutral to recommending this course. I think it had its positives and negatives, but overall it was a fine course.","neu"
98957,"Yes for students interested in science without developing the technical skills associated","r"
98957,"Yes, great class to fill a distributional requirement. Just need to study for the exams","r"
98957,"I would recommend to non-science majors because the course gives scientific insight in a way that can be applied to writing.","r"
98957,"Yes. If you are a not a biology or any science-related major and looking for a science class that is interesting, I recommend this class.","r"
98957,"I would recommend this course to a student who is thinking of taking a science major path at Yale. To get a good understanding of baseline biological science","r"
98957,"Yes, I learned a lot of foundational science stuff without being overwhelmed.","r"
98957,"Not if they are expecting a gut. Some sections are definitely more challenging than others and require more knowledge about biology.","dr"
98957,"Absolutely, if you're looking for a science requirement. The lectures are pretty distilled and comprehensible, and the course organizers and lecturers do a good job of making sure to highlight what is important to learn so you don't get bogged down in details and unnecessary information.","r"
98957,"Absolutely. As long as you attend class and pay attention it is not too challenging","r"
98957,"yes! science credit that was thoughtful but not overwhelming for a non-stem major student","r"
98957,"I think I would recommend this course to another student who is willing to put in the time to engage with the course's content. There are science classes out there that have similar workloads and more niche topics that I'm sure can more specifically cater to someone's interests. However, I think you really get out of this class what you put into it. Grading is fair and as long as you don't write this class off as being super easy and not worth studying for then you'll do fine. It also didn't add significant extra stress to my semester. I invested the most time into this class when we were nearing an exam which is to be expected.","neu"
98957,"I think this is a wonderful course for anyone looking to get a broad education in interesting biological topics. I had a great time learning about the various topics covered in class and feel like the instructors all did a good job explaining their content to the students.","r"
98957,"I would recommend this course to another student. It is an insightful course that gives you the ability to question how biology impacts our world.","r"
98957,"Yes! Its a great way to get a science credit while having enriching dialogues about how science impacts society","r"
98957,"Yes. Good easy science class","r"
98957,"Absolutely! As someone who hates science, it made learning about science do practical and necessary for understand major issues in everyday life like climate change and COVID-19. Everything I learned felt like it had purpose.","r"
98957,"Yes. Its a great science class for humanities and social sciences majors.","r"
98957,"I unfortunately do not think that I would recommend this course to another student only because the formatting was a bit confusing for me. It was a bit frustrating how the discussion sections did not correlate to the conversations in lecture. It was also a bit jarring for me occasionally when we would have fairly easy understandable lectures and then suddenly an extremely complicated lecture that utilized scientific terms that a lot us didn't recognize without explanation. The structure of the course just made it a bit challenging for me to comprehend all the material.","dr"
98957,"Yes, its a great intro into a number of scientific areas from which students can branch out into other areas too.","r"
98957,"Yes, I would. I would encourage them to increase their engagement with the material however possible, but also recommend the course because it is a great opportunity to learn comprehensive biology.","r"
98957,"Yes. Good overview of scientific concepts without being too difficult","r"
98957,"Yes, its a straightforward and relatively easy science credit.","r"
98957,"I'd recommend this course to anyone. Whether you're in need of a science credit or wanting to take an intro level biology course.","r"
98957,"yes!","r"
98957,"Yes, if you want to learn more about bio and applied situations. Exams are purely memorization from slides","r"
98957,"Yes, especially for students who are not stem majors, it is a great way to gain a working understanding of biology in everyday context.","r"
98957,"Yes! If you enjoyed bio in high school but havent done it since, this will be great. Its fun and worth it to study with friends so try and take it with friends if you can","r"
98957,"For sure, if you're looking for a chill course to fulfill a science credit, you should probably take this. Interesting climate change unit, I really hope they keep that in.","r"
98957,"I would recommend this course to none stem majors for a basic knowledge of biology.","r"
98957,"helpful if you want to know basic concepts of bio on surface level; do not take if you want to go in depth on one topic and if you like to monitor your grades in this class because they do not use canvas","neu"
98957,"Yes","r"
98957,"I would recommend this course to another student, given the understanding that the course covers a lot of material in a short amount of time, so it is time consuming to prepare for exams.","r"
98957,"Yes. I thought this course was very informative.","r"
98957,"Yes, but only because I find it very hard to find enjoyable & not overly challenging science credits at this school","r"
98957,"Yes! I think it's great for anyone who wants a solid foundational understanding of biology, especially for those who aren't STEM majors.","r"
98957,"Yes Yes Yes. A gutty science for sure.","r"
98957,"Yes, I feel it is a great science credit with material that allows you to stay engaged if it is not in line with your planned major.","r"
98957,"Yes if they want to learn about personally relevant biology and a course that is not too demanding.","r"
98957,"I think so, the topics we discussed in the class were interesting and most of the lectures were engaging. The tests were a bit challenging, but most of the content on them was expected","neu"
98957,"yes!! especially for students who may have loved high school bio but didn't want to take the biol sequence here at yale","r"
98957,"Yes, for students wanting to explore multiple avenues of biology and its impact on the world.","r"
98957,"I recommend this course to anyone who needs a science req!","r"
98957,"yeah its a fine science credit, but there are probably better options that are more engaging","neu"
98957,"If youre looking for a fun class then no","dr"
98957,"Yes!! If you need a science credit and aren't a STEM major, I definitely recommend this course! It's literally tailored for non-STEM students, so it is very accessible for people who don't have a big science background. I think it was a pretty easy class, and you learn about a lot of interesting things.","r"
98957,"Would definitely recommend it, especially to a non-science major looking to gain a general understanding.","r"
98957,"Yes, because the class material is interesting with a flexible workload.","r"
98957,"Yes, this is a good course for non-science majors. It does require some effort but it is not overwhelming and very doable. The content is well-taught and I feel more confident in my ability to consume scientific news and to be an informed citizen in our age of pandemics and climate change.","r"
98957,"Absolutely! I am the hugest fan of bio the world and us. It was fun, accessible, and insightful! It made me feel confident again about science - and like oh yeah science is something I can do! All the other STEM classes I have taken at Yale have been discouraging, and have made me feel like an imposter, but in this class I felt celebrated, and welcomed into the field.","r"
98957,"Yes! great science credit and intro to biology with a focus on how they affect us. Topics were very engaging!","r"
98957,"Yes! Good basics to know. Fun science credit.","r"
98957,"Maybe? While I do feel I learned a lot of interesting information on certain topics (neuroscience, drug use, etc.), lectures weren't always helpful and it would feel a great deal of my learning had to happen outside of the classroom. This course is traditionally thought of as a gut, and while that may be true as far as lecture attendance goes. students HAVE to study pretty extensively for exams. I do feel there are other more compelling courses to take to complete the science requirement, however if a student ends up having to take this course, its not...terrible.","neu"
98972,"Absolutely, super interested","r"
98972,"take it if u have to","neu"
98972,"I would recommend this class to a student who wants an overview of biochemistry that covers the various metabolic processes without going extremely in depth to the point of needed lots of memorization.","r"
98972,"I would recommend this course, the exams were stressful but the content is really interesting.","r"
98972,"Yes I absolutely would. It's my favorite STEM course I have taken here and reaffirmed by choice of major and career direction. I learned a lot and even though I spent a TON of time studying for exams, I felt that the hard work payed off in a way that isn't always true for STEM courses here.","r"
98972,"Yes - good basis for biochemistry concepts","r"
98972,"I would recommend this course over the other biochemistry course. I'm sure if you're taking it, it's probably to fulfill a requirement. you just gotta push through it, start studying for the exams about a week in advance, it'll all be okay and over before you know it.","r"
98972,"Yes - for premed.","r"
98972,"If interested or necessary.","neu"
98972,"Yes, absolutely, with Professor Breaker. He makes the material so enjoyable.","r"
98972,"If you need it for your major or premed","r"
98972,"I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in both biology and chemistry. It was a great class.","r"
98972,"I would recommend this course to premed students.","r"
98972,"Yes! Great way to synthesize knowledge from bio and orgo - I really felt everything coming together for the first time.","r"
98972,"Yes, Professor Breaker is a great lecture!","r"
98972,"Only if you have to take it.","neu"
98972,"Yes, it was great if you want to delve deeper into chemistry","r"
98972,"As a med school requirement, I anticipated that I would enjoy the course far less than I actually did. There was certainly a lot of rote memorization, and I don't regard reaction mechanisms as the most interesting topic of instruction. That said, the application of this information to the broader scope of biological processes made it more digestible than organic chemistry, and I think I learned a lot of information that I will actually take away from the course. Because your grade is comprised only of 4 exams, the workload is relatively low on non-testing weeks, but you'll need to allocate a decent amount of time for review prior to tests because a lot of information is covered in each module. I feel that the exams were graded fairly and you'll come out doing well if you understand the most important topics of a lecture at a medium level of resolution.","neu"
98972,"I would only recommend this course to another student of similar majors, or interests. Because of the level of difficulty and understanding, I believe not everyone should take this course.","neu"
98972,"Only for the premed pre-req","neu"
98972,"Yes! Professor Breaker is so passionate about the subject matter and his passion really translates and makes students engaged and excited. It was nice to tie together concepts from both introductory biology and organic chemistry.","r"
98972,"Absolutely, and if you are interested in the material even more so. With Professor Breaker and the rest of the teaching staff, any material becomes accessible.","r"
98972,"Yes","r"
98972,"I would recommend this course if Breaker is teaching it. His exams are very fair and he makes learning the material manageable, and does not just run through the slides like other professors.","r"
98972,"Yes this was a really good class! Breaker really made Biochemistry interesting. I especially appreciated how he focused more on the concepts of biochemistry rather than making it a pure route memorization class. I really enjoyed this class and learning biochem and would fully recommend it!","r"
98972,"Yes- one of the better taught STEM courses Ive taken at Yale.","r"
98972,"I would recommend this course to anyone that needs it as well as anyone that is curious to learn more about the underlying chemical mechanisms of how biology and biological processes work.","r"
98972,"If you enjoyed organic chemistry I'm sure you'll enjoy this class but if you're not really a science person I wouldn't necessarily recommend.","neu"
98972,"More likely than not you're taking this as a premed requirement. I went in with low expectations but ultimately was pleased with the clarity of the lectures and the fairness of the exams. Also, the workload was fairly low except for a week before each exam. All in all, I enjoyed this class much more than I expected.","neu"
98972,"Only if its a major requirement","neu"
98972,"Yes, if there is a strong desire to understand biology and chemistry in a way that interconnects the two heavily.","r"
98972,"This is a very interesting course I would recommend. The professor is very excited and passionate about his subject, and the course covers a lot of cool material. This course also covers some of the more technical sides of biology at the microscopic and molecular levels, which I feel most courses overlook. If you take this course in conjunction with MCDB 290 (Microbiology) these two courses supplement each other well.","r"
98972,"Only if you have toit's a solid biochem class, especially for premeds, but I would have loved some more infrastructure to support my learning. Most of it was independent","neu"
98972,"Yes, I would definitley recommend this course as a good starting point to get foundational knowledge in biochemistry that can be applied to many different higher level subjects. It also includes a lot of medically relevant topics and so is very engaging for pre-med students.","r"
98972,"Yes!","r"
98972,"Yes, if you are premed or interested in biology and chemistry.","r"
98972,"Yes.","r"
98972,"Maybe. If they think that p-sets help facilitate learning, I would opt for the MB&B 300 version. If not, I think this would be a good fit. Breaker is a good professor.","neu"
98972,"You're probably taking this as a prereq, but I actually would recommend it to those that enjoyed the beginning of orgo 1 (and less so the synthesis portion). I loved making orgo connections when looking at the different reactions and mechanisms Breaker taught.","r"
98988,"Yes! This isn't really a science gut (the material is difficult) but it's a really interesting class and the workload is low. If you have a background in biology but aren't a stem-major, you'd be well prepared for this.","r"
98988,"I would recommend this course. Professor Kavathas is amazing and the course is a great learning environment. In my opinion, this is the perfect class for humanities students in the sciences. My TA, Gabriel, was also one of the best I've had in any course.","r"
98988,"no.","dr"
98988,"good for a science gut -- readings are interesting, PSETs are manageable (work w buddies) and grading is fine. prof kavathas is very sweet and passionate","r"
98988,"Not unless you have a background in biology. I took this as a non-stem person because I needed a science credit, and it definitely didn't feel like it was geared towards non-stem people.","dr"
98988,"Not to a student with little or no science experience. If you've taken higher level science classes yes. A lot more students than expected had a science background in the class.","neu"
98988,"Maybe, if you have a strong biology background or are a STEM major. I struggled a lot with grasping the material as a non-stem major and was never really confident in what I understood/didn't know. It was definitely not a gut for me.","neu"
98988,"Yes, but not if this student is interested in an easy science credit. This course is challenging in the breadth of content covered. There is a lot packed into lectures.","r"
98988,"THIS IS NOT A GUT. Trust me on this. Will you learn a ton about the immune system? Yes. Is that information fascinating? Absolutely. But is this an easy course? Not at all. You will have to invest time and energy into learning about biological mechanisms which can be very confusing if you are not coming from an AP Bio or college-level background. I am grateful that I took this course because I learned a lot. But it was harder than I has expecting.","neu"
98988,"yes if they are a STEM major and can keep up with a very fast-paced class","r"
98988,"Yes! It was an informative way to get a science credit.","r"
98988,"Only would recommend if you have some background in the content of the class. Don't take this as a gut science.","neu"
98988,"Yes, quite interesting!","r"
98988,"Yes, its definitely not a gut, but overall the experience was great and totally worth it!","r"
98988,"Yes! Keep in mind while it is very accessible for non-stem majors it is not a gut. It is very doable, but you will have to study for the midterm and put work into other assignments for the course. But it is a great way to get a science credit and learn deep and relevant information about the body and medicine. Professor Kavathas is also great.","r"
98988,"I was just taking this class to get my last science credit, and it served that purpose. It was more challenging that I expected it to be as a class geared toward non-science majors. Expect to have to understand the concepts more than memorize them, which is good for actually learning but made the class more challenging. Overall though, it was an engaging course and the workload is pretty light. So if the topics interest you, I would recommend it as a science credit that isn't bland.","neu"
98988,"Yes if you are interested in the nuances of the immune system","r"
98988,"Yes, it is a great class for non-science students. It provides you with comprehensive knowledge of the immune system and equips you with a necessary biology foundation.","r"
98988,"I would definitely recommend this class to a student looking for a science credit, but I would warn them that this class is not a gut. Especially in the first few weeks, the class moves quickly through a ton of scientific terminology, but it's nothing that someone without high school bio can't handle. It's well worth it, though after a few weeks you feel like you have a fleshed-out understanding of the immune system that can be very satisfying. None of the memorization felt gratuitous.","r"
98988,"Yes if you are interested in the subject. It is a pretty information dense class which can be a bit overwhelming but also really interesting. Theres a lot to study for the midterm and final, but there isnt a lot of work throughout the semester. I really enjoyed the class overall and am definitely glad I took it.","r"
98988,"Yes, it is a great course for non-science majors to learn about the immune system and how our body fights diseases. This course greatly improves science literacy.","r"
98988,"I would recommend this course to a student interested in medicine or the immune system, but would stress that this is not a gut.","r"
98988,"I would recommend this course to a stem major or anyone interested in immunology. However, for a non-stem major looking to explore or fulfill a science credit, I would definitely not recommend this course.","neu"
98988,"Yes, because this course is a guarantee you will learn something every day and be challenges but is a manageable workload.","r"
98988,"I would recommend this course. I'm an American Studies major and took this course for my science credit. I've been frustrated with SC/QR credits before because it can feel like a waste of time, especially if you aren't learning much or it doesn't feel very relevant. This class struck a good balance of being somewhat challenging generally without demanding excessive effort. The psets were reasonable, and the open-book final was very helpful. The closed notes midterm was challenging, but in the end it forced me to understand concepts from early in the semester which ended up being important throughout the rest of the semester. At the end, I felt like I learned a lot. That said, the class was a little disorganized and the workload was pretty demanding (3 psets, a quiz, a presentation, a midterm, and a final). I took this as my fifth class, with an already heavy-workload semester, and I don't know that I would recommend that.","r"
98988,"Yes! The workload was very manageable, yet the material learned was rich.","r"
98988,"I would if you are really interested in biology and immune diseases. However, if you are a non-STEM major this is probably not the class for you unless you have this specific niche interest.","neu"
98997,"If you are any kind of bio major (BME, MCDB) or pre-med student, this course is an absolute must! It's a great way to learn cell bio for the MCAT and is also deeply informative.","r"
98997,"Yes! I loved this class!","r"
98997,"I would highly recommend this course. This is a must take MCDB core course.","r"
98997,"I would definitely recommend it! This is one of the best MCDB core classes I have taken. It was really interesting and engaging without being too much work. There is definitely consistent work (with quizzes every week instead of exams), but was super manageable.","r"
98997,"yes, especially if you are interested in getting a broad overview of cell bio topics. Lectures go fairly in depth about various pathways which can be cool, but most isnt essential info.","r"
98997,"Yes, it gives good exposure to a wide range of cell bio topics.","r"
98997,"yes (especially if it counts towards your major), but I would recommend taking class before biochem before this if possible as it assumes some biochem knowledge. It's definitely not impossible to learn the necessary biochem/chem principles through this class (that's what I had to do), but I think it's a lot easier if you had some previous biochem knowledge. This class is very interesting, but it's easy to lose track of the big picture due to all of the details and you should be prepared to put in consistent, sustained effort to understand the material of this class (don't be lulled into a sense of false security by the fact that handouts are allowed on the quizzes!).","r"
98997,"Yes: If you can organize your time to study at least one day a week to prep for the quizzes. This course is special in that the amount of work that you do is really reflected in what you get out of it. Don't get me wrong, if you don't do the work you aren't going to get an A. However, going to the Peer Tutor Review Sessions, attending Discussion Section, and studying the review material is likely to help you get an A.","r"
98997,"Absolutely. If you're an MCDB major and need another core course, this is a great choice. The quiz-based style forces you to keep up with content but also makes the workload relatively low (it's literally only weekly quizzes and the final) and lets you avoid stressful exams. The professors are great and are very excited to answer your questions if you go to their office hours or ask after class. They also tried to make the class interactive even though it was a lecture. I found most of the content to be interesting and well taught. I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to handle the challenge of this course but it ended up being really good and I'm glad I chose to stay in it. Definitely consider it if you're MCDB","r"
98997,"Yes, especially for pre-med students taking their MCATs. This class is really well-structured to benefit these students.","r"
98997,"I would recommend for anyone who enjoyed the cell bio semester of the introduction bio sequence and anyone who is a MCDB major.","r"
98997,"I probably would not recommend this class to someone without pre-existing interest in STEM or more specifically biology. Although the class is more in-depth than the previous experience I had with a cell biology course (something I appreciated about this course), I think that I would only recommend this course to someone that already had a pre-existing interest in the subject.","dr"
98997,"Yes!","r"
98997,"Absolutely I loved this class","r"
98997,"Yes, absolutely. You will learn a lot. Its not easy per se, and the weekly quizzes can be challenging. But you wont have to worry about falling behind because the quizzes force you to stay up to date with the content. Its nice taking a science class without psets, and the grading seemed fair throughout.","r"
98997,"Yes, this was a very interesting and well tought foundational MCDB course","r"
98997,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I found the material to be quite interesting. If you are an MCDB major, I feel like this course is one of the better foundational courses offered by the department. Be prepared to spend time thoroughly going over the lecture material and packets each week.","r"
98997,"Sure! It's a great and very useful core class, and I think people from other majors would also find the content interesting. Certainly a really cool class to credit/d if you're not too concerned about it for your future major path/career.","r"
98997,"yes","r"
98997,"Yes! Dont be afraid of the workload on coursetable - this course is fantastic for growing as a researcher and student. The teaching team is there to support you completely and it is a great course to learn all about cell biology!","r"
98997,"I would recommend this course only if youre in the major or if you are interested in this field. The workload is heavy even thought there are only weekly quizzes.","neu"
98997,"It's a challenging course, but I would recommend any student who is interested in cell biology to take it. It is an excellent foundational course for other biology classes. So long as you establish a routine from the very beginning of the semester, you will find that the coursework remains relatively the same every week.","r"
99001,"I would! You definitely need to be interested in the material and willing to put in the extra work when studying for exams and quizzes, but the class is incredibly interesting and well taught. I never knew I was interested in the material until I actually started learning it. Although the grade breakdown can be scary, it really isn't that bad if you take good notes and study for the exams.","r"
99001,"Unless you really have to take the course I would not recommend taking it, since you will have to prepare for very specific and overly complicated exam questions that were not really discussed in lecture.","dr"
99001,"If you're interested in biology, yes, but if not, absolutely not. It can be very dry and boring to those who aren't interested.","neu"
99001,"Yes! This is has been one of my favorite MCDB classes I have taken at Yale. The lectures are very engaging and rewarding. You will learn a lot and it is important to review the material as you go along because the concepts will build on each other as you go through the semester. It is a manageable workload, with weekly quizzes (not that hard if you attend and review the lectures) and three non-cumulative exams.","r"
99002,"Yes! Took this course to fulfill a req for the neuro major and was a good addition to my pre-med background and my interest in reproduction without being too intensive","r"
99002,"Yes -- especially good as an additional personal interest course to someone in a medicine-adjacent major and with advanced understanding of biology. I think intro bio sequence is a pre requisite but would be very hard to succeed in the course without a B+ or greater in earlier Bio courses.  Definitely would recommend going to every lecture; since there is no continuity between lectures you can't count on a recording or review of the slides.","r"
99002,"YES! it was awesome","r"
99002,"I would not recommend this course unless you wanna to be a gyno specifically I guess. If you are in MCDB take another course I promise this isn't the gut you want and it is not worth it.","dr"
99002,"Yes - it's pretty easy and you learn a lot as well.","r"
99002,"I would recommend only if you need it for the MCDB major.","r"
99002,"Yes, good survey course. You learn a lot about the reproductive system. Good content if you're interested. The rotating professors can make things tricky, but it was a decent lecture course.","r"
99002,"Yes! This class is really interesting and a different format than I am used to since each class has a different professor. This makes sure that you are learning the topic from a prof who is an expert on that specific format.","r"
99002,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Course wasn't that difficult and the content was interesting/useful.","r"
99002,"Yes, great content and I felt that I learned a lot. I think having open note exams was great in the sense that I actually found myself listening to and enjoying lectures with the goal of understanding the information instead of stressing about having to eventually memorize it. All the lecturers were really passionate about their field, which was inspiring as a student.","r"
99002,"I found this a highly interesting course and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in reproduction or reproductive healthcare. The format is pretty chill, as long as you show up to lecture and pay attention you will be fine. The grades are entirely based off 3, not curved exams which are open note. There is no homework and discussion is optional if you aren't an MCDB major. Still, I learned so much and some of the lecturers are really good. Plus, a lot of them are practicing physicians and you can ask them questions afterwards. I loved this class and would highly recommend","r"
99002,"There are better biology classes at Yale, although this one is certainly not the worst.","neu"
99002,"I would highly recommend this course to another student!!","r"
99002,"I would recommend this course to students with interests in the scientific bases of menstruation, pregnancy, menopause, childbirth, and assisted reproductive technologies.","r"
99002,"Yes, this is a course that I took as a non-major and I really enjoyed it.","r"
99002,"I think the content of the course is interesting, especially since there are specialists in each field lecturing. They tend to give a lot of helpful insight and examples of their work.","r"
99002,"Yes! Great professors and instructors.","r"
99002,"Yes! Overall, I learned so much more than I thought because the material on the exams was exactly what was covered in the lectures, so if you paid attention and reviewed your notes, you would do good in the exams while also learning and retaining a lot of information.","r"
99002,"Yes, a great course to delve into reproductive bio and make a lot of connections.","r"
99002,"Yes! For students looking for their first MCDB class to take, I would recommend this course or the Genetics course because they are comparatively more well organized and interesting.","r"
99002,"Yes! I think more people should take this class! It was so interesting and everyone I talked to wanted to know more, so I hope more students take it.","r"
99002,"I would recommend only if you have a good handle of biochem beforehand! There is a lot of biochem.","r"
99002,"Yes - this is a great course for premeds or anyone interested in biology.","r"
99007,"Yes! This was my first upper-level MCDB course and I really enjoyed it.","r"
99007,"Yes, this is an interesting class that is pretty relaxed","r"
99007,"Yes, it's one of my favorite MCDB core so far! The content is very interesting!","r"
99007,"no. exams were out to get you, rather than help you learn","dr"
99007,"Yes, although I will say, if you are not interested in microbio, it might become boring","r"
99007,"Only if you need it to fulfill your requirements. Otherwise, don't go through the exams for this. Not worth it.","neu"
99007,"No. Not in its current form. Very ambiguous and demoralizing course. Improvements to grading structure, and content proportions would need to be changed. Currently, this course focuses almost exclusively on bacteria and the research being conducted by the professors. They prioritized the minutiae of mechanisms over the big picture time and time again.","dr"
99007,"Yes take it, its super interesting","r"
99007,"Yes!! I would highly recommend this course both to MCDB students and anyone who might be curious about bacteria and microorganisms. The topics covered in each lecture are quite interesting, and there are a breadth of topics so even if one or two lectures feel boring, the rest will be different. There is no homework, there are many opportunities for review through office hours and review sessions, and there are practice questions in class to see if you're on track. The only con would be that the questions tested on exams are quite specific and about details, but the class is curved anyway.","r"
99007,"Yes if you need to finish your MCDB requirements, take this one","r"
99007,"I would only recommend it to pre-med students and MCDB majors that need to take the class. It is a challenging class and can be really hard if you are not on top of it.","neu"
99007,"Yes! a thousand times yes","r"
99007,"Yes absolutely especially if you are a MCDB major!","r"
99007,"If you are willing to keep up with the material on your own it might not be bad. Lectures are packed and exams cherry-pick information so you really need to know everything ever mentioned.","neu"
99007,"I think so. The exams cover a lot of information and they tend to be very memorization-heavy. But I think this is among one of the most well-organized MCDB core classes. The grading is very vague and little information is given to students about their performance","neu"
99007,"Sure! A better MCDB class but still a bit high stakes given that 3 exams make up most of your grade.","r"
99007,"Yes, I would. Although this course was not easy for me, the professors did a great job of presenting the content in approachable and interesting ways. This course reaffirmed my interest in MCDB!","r"
99007,"I would really recommend this course! It is a gem within the MCDB department and is the best core class I've taken. The professors and teaching team are very passionate, brilliant, and engaging. The material is interesting, and the class is very accessible and does not rely on heavy chemistry and biochemistry. Of special note is Professor Hatzios who has gone above and beyond in organizing the course itself and also in her portion of the lectures. She was so helpful during office hours and is a very passionate instructor who cares about her students' success: that alone is reason enough to take this course. Take it for the fascinating material, the accessible nature of the course, and the incredible structure and teaching team. Microbiology has hands-down been my favorite MCDB core class.","r"
99007,"I would. I learned so much about micro, but I also felt like I was unprepared for the exams to some extent. Make sure to keep up with the studying aspect of the class.","r"
99007,"YES. The topics covered are SO INTERESTING!!! Microbiome, bioremediation, disease, metabolism... the lectures are awesome. BUT, the exams are SO HARD. This is definitely not an easy A at all.","r"
99012,"Yes, it one of the only courses that exposes students to diseases in the clinical setting!","r"
99012,"Yes. Great for pre-meds to have a more clinical perspective on biological issues.","r"
99012,"I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in medicine. It offers a taste of what a medically oriented class looks like as most of the faculty are from the med school! This is a good way to know if studying disease feels like a good fit for you. The course material is complex, but they present it manageably.","r"
99012,"Great MCDB elective that is interesting and relevant, especially for pre-med students","r"
99012,"Definitely would recommend- thoroughly enjoyed the class and the professors, especially the real case studies that are discussed (many of which come from YNNH and their own experiences).","r"
99012,"Yes, it is a useful course for any MCDB and premed students and gives a good glimpse into how pathologies arise and how to diagnose them.","r"
99012,"Yes, this is the perfect class for an upper-level pre-med student. It gives great exposure to different disease areas.","r"
99012,"Yes! if you're interested in clinical medicine this is an awesome class. If you are looking for a good grade, or grade security, perhaps not. there are five exams, all different, and those are entirely responsible for your grade.","r"
99012,"I would totally recommend this course to all my friends (even if they are not premed).","r"
99012,"This was my favorite class at Yale so far (second semester junior). It was incredibly engaging and thought provoking. It was because of this class that I considered being pre-med again. It's a special class at Yale/in the MCDB major in that beyond just memorizing different diseases and symptoms, you are actually applying the information that you have learned. You have to piece together information and come to conclusions on your own in a way that challenges you to understand what you are learning about. It also taught content that is very intersectional with other MCDB classes. I highly highly recommend this class.","r"
99012,"Yes, if you're interested in learning about pathophysiology this class will give you a good review of the pathologies of the body.","r"
99012,"Yes! Especially if you can credit D it. It was an awesome class and so interesting. Not something most think about when envisioning med school, but was a super helpful supplement","r"
99012,"Yes, especially if you have a strong background in biology and an interest in medicine/pathology.","r"
99012,"I would recommend this course to anyone considering medicine as a future career. The best part of this course is that all of the professors are physicians, so they are able to contextualize the course content.","r"
99012,"I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in how disease manifests at the molecular and macroscopic levels. I found it to be a course that integrated lots of important concepts from biochemical pathways to larger organ system concepts.","r"
99012,"Yes, but I will tell them that although they tell you not to memorize all of the terms, 50% of the quizzes will be pure memorization. For example, during the cancer block, we were told that we did not have to memorize certain genes, lists of cancer hallmarks, etc. The very first question was ""What are all 10 hallmarks of cancer"". Two questions later, ""What is a gene that predisposes one to cancer""","r"
99015,"Absolutely. Even as a non-bio student I was able to learn and explore biological science through a unique lens that introduced me to a new world of possibilities for the future. This course is excellent for preparing you for applications in the fields of research, medical technology, and the ""real world"".","r"
99015,"Yes","r"
99015,"Yes, you get a nice overview of the biotech field!","r"
99015,"Yes, very interesting course.","r"
99015,"If you are looking for a final MCDB class then yes take it. Otherwise I would avoid. the weekly reading responses are quite time consuming to write and exams are not graded with much clarity.","neu"
99015,"Yes, this course goes through a wide array of topics, and very practical skills on the business side of things are also taught.","r"
99015,"Yes, I enjoyed this course.","r"
99015,"Probably not. It is unfortunate because the content of the class is incredibly fascinating, but I think the teaching and structure around the course falls short. When Professors Crews and Yannick were not teaching the class, I found the content difficult to follow. There is generally a large amount of background knowledge that is assumed. While this might be understandable for an upper-level elective, professors seemed to believe there was a high degree familiarity with more niche areas of biology like immunobiology. And, because the class is disorganized, the second exam also felt fairly unpredictable which contributes to my overall assessment.","dr"
99015,"Yes, this course if great for both premed students and students interested in grad school. The workload is not stressful and most lectures are recorded as well.","r"
99015,"absolutely, this course was so interesting and taught me a lot about the world of biotech, both from a business and application perspective","r"
99015,"Yes, if youre at all interested in a career in medicine or science or pharma this is a must take. The experiments and scientific skills you learn are so applicable and relevant to the current market landscape and the papers each week are not only interesting and historic papers in the field of biotech, but give you really good practice at reading study results.","r"
99015,"Yes! Please take this course. All the content is really interesting, the professors are great, and it's not too much work. I learned so much from the course and I thought it was really well organized, especially the sections.","r"
99015,"Yes, it was an interesting class and I learned a lot, even as someone who is not majoring in MCDB.","r"
99015,"Definitely if you want an easyish MCDB class especially senior year that is applicable post grad","r"
99015,"Yes. This course offers valuable information about the advances in biotechnology that may not be obtained from a traditional textbook.","r"
99015,"Yes, I think it's a great source of general knowledge and gaining extra knowledge on the foundation of some topics.","r"
99015,"If you are interested in understanding how technology can be used to help treat people with diseases then yes. If you are a premed then yes because it was an interesting perspective to healthcare.","r"
99015,"Yes! This course is unlike any other MCDB course that I have taken, and it has changed the way that I think about biotechnology as an industry as well as the potential that biology has on other fields.","r"
99015,"yeah","r"
99039,"If useful for your major (probably something engineering or physics related) then I would recommend this course","neu"
99039,"This class is basically an extension of Physics 180, but for rigid bodies that can be applied to real-life systems. I think the only people that take this course are people that are required to, but it's a pretty chill class.","neu"
99039,"Yes. I'm not an engineering major, so I don't know whether it's required or whether there is overlap with other required classes, but it's not overly difficult, and the content was a helpful review of topics I hadn't studied since high school physics.","r"
99039,"prof orelup is pretty great and very understanding","r"
99039,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course offers a great chance to really understand motion in a way that introductory physics courses do not allow. The material is not all that confusing, and you can really grasp everything if you work hard at it and practice. Also, Dr. Orelup is an outstanding professor and great guy overall. This course was awesome as a MENG class and just as a course at Yale.","r"
99039,"Only take this if you need it for your major. I would recommend it to meche students though. It wasnt too bad.","neu"
99039,"I would recommend this course, it was taught at 6 pm which sucked but the professor cares that the students develop the messed art concepts.","r"
99039,"Yes I would definitely. I know it is an ABET requirement so most taking it don't have a choice but I think it is a great course for teaching students to engage with the material. I would warn students to not get behind in studying for this class. Go to office hours and ask questions and get a clear conceptual understanding of the physical systems. This is not a class where you can memorize things and it will go well.","r"
99039,"Yes, I would highly recommend this course because the lecture slides were so good, the class was so organized, and the professor actually took the time to explain all the steps when we did examples in class.","r"
99039,"Yes I would! Dynamics is a fun subject to learn and taking this course gave me a greater appreciation for many real world engineering phenomena.","r"
99077,"Yep! Great music course!","r"
99077,"Absolutely","r"
99077,"You gotta","r"
99077,"yes so fun! Prof herreid is great and so is this class!!!!","r"
99077,"Yes","r"
99077,"Yes, this is a great way to enjoy and perform new repertoire.","r"
99077,"Yes! Such a fun class for singers and instrumentalists.","r"
99077,"Yes!!!","r"
99077,"I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any serious musician. Don't take this class if you don't know how to read music, obviously, but it's such a rewarding experience for a very wide range of instrumentalists and singers.","r"
99077,"Yes! Best class ever!","r"
99077,"I had so much fun singing in this class! Take it!","r"
99077,"Yes! This is one of the best courses at Yale, and the opportunity to perform and learn Renaissance music (particularly for instrumentalists) is one you might not get elsewhere.","r"
99077,"I would recommend this course to someone who can play an instrument and enjoys playing it.","r"
99077,"Yes, especially those interested in the performance of early music.","r"
99077,"Yes, very interesting lectures and fun music. Grant is also super cool.","r"
99077,"Absolutely. For anyone even mildly interested in performing early music, this course is a no-brainer.","r"
99077,"I can only speak to the experience of taking the class as a singer, but I definitely recommend it. It's fun, Prof Herreid is a great professor, and it's not a lot of work. If you can't sight read very well you'll need to spend some extra time practicing, but even then I'd recommend the class.","r"
99077,"If you can hold a tune and/or do a cappella, great stress free class to add to your course schedule.","r"
99077,"Yes! You can have the chance to play a new instrument and play early music with an ensemble (and perform in the Beinecke!) in a low-stakes setting.","r"
99077,"Yes, this class is fantastic, the music will challenge you and you will have a wonderful experience.","r"
99077,"Yes if you are interested in the material! Performing in the Beinecke was such an incredible experience, as well as learning new music and performing with unique instruments.","r"
99122,"Yes!! It was one of my favorite classes i have ever taken. The prof was amazing and the class was so interesting. Really helped me understand more about the criminal brain","r"
99122,"Yup. Very interesting class, looked forward to it every Tuesday/Thursday.","r"
99122,"Yes, if they want to learn about criminal psychopathy.","r"
99122,"Absolutely!","r"
99122,"Great as a special interest course for Neuro and psychology students. The science content is accessible to STEM majors and easy enough to understand for those who are coming from more humanities majors.  Would recommend going to lectures live, since verbal explanations of the content were much more thorough than online slides. in this case just reviewing online is not really enough to grasp content for the first time.","r"
99122,"Yes, it was great!","r"
99122,"This is a course that you must engage with on some level in order to learn/succeed, so if you are willing to do the readings, study for exams, and show up to lectures, you will gain a lot from it,","neu"
99122,"I would recommend it, I think if you're a psychology major or have taken a lot of psychology classes in the past/worked in a lab some of the material may be a little repetitive but I think the content is extremely important and the class is super interesting and is designed in a way that helps you do well if you do the work so I would recommend","r"
99122,"Its not a gut! Super interesting class and definitely worth it but dont take it if you want a gut.","r"
99122,"No, because of the biased content and haphazard selection of papers to read","dr"
99122,"Yes, super interesting class. Not too stressful. The way assignment and exams are done feels like it really does prioritise learning, not just testing. Guest lectures were super interesting too","r"
99122,"Yes!! It is fascinating and organised and a great class to take no matter your background.","r"
99122,"I definitely would. This is such a great course to gain exposure to law and psychobiology. Even if youre not a psychology or neuro major, I highly recommend. The workload is manageable and Prof Baskin-Sommers does an amazing job at being reasonable and fair in regards to grading.","r"
99122,"Yes--the course is definitely structured around student learning, but be prepared for a low bullshit tolerance compared to other yale classes. Take this class seriously. It's worth it.","r"
99122,"yes it was an extremely interesting topic to study","r"
99122,"Yes, for a non-psychology/cog sci major, this is a wonderful overview of the American legal system and what ""crime"" really suggests about a person, a community and a society; for a psych/cog sci major, Dr. Baskin-Sommers is an expert in the field and she will help you understand a lot of the technical nuances in the field, and her explanations are always clear and concise.","r"
99122,"Absolutely, I learned so much from this course and I loved how many aspects of so many different fields (psychology, neuroscience, law) were incorporated into the lectures.","r"
99122,"I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in psychology","r"
99122,"Yes","r"
99122,"Absolutely I would recommend this course. The conversations and knowledge that this course encourages and introduces are very important for students at Yale to be aware of and to understand. In general, learning more about what is behind crime and not generalizing people as bad because of something they do is vital, and this class helps understand what goes behind an individual that may commit a crime. The workload is also bearable and facilitates student learning very well.","r"
99122,"Yes, it was super interesting and probably one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale!!","r"
99122,"Yes! Great class that is set up for student success","r"
99122,"YES as a psychology major myself, this class gave me academic motivation to pursue this study which can actually help change people's lives. Psychology and law is SO interesting. The professor is so inspirational.","r"
99122,"yes, if you want a more science based humanities/social science class","r"
99122,"Yes absolutely. If you are interested in law or the criminal-legal system, this class will give you the scientific background to know what factors actually lead to crime and how they can be addressed.","r"
99122,"yes","r"
99122,"Yes, this class is very interesting and I found it fun to learn about Psychopaths and their brain functioning.","r"
99122,"YES!","r"
99122,"Absolutely yes! It was not only interesting and engaging (I actually loved doing the readings and going to lecture), but prof Baskin-Sommers did a great job centering the content on real-world issues.","r"
99122,"YES!!! Actually my FAVORITE class. Professor is so wonderful and SO engaging! Even though there are 400+ students she still would put a note on my essays when I improved.","r"
99122,"Yes! Its a great course, anyone can take it and confidently learn the material I think. Its not too inaccesible even if youre not a psych major, but it still covers a lot.","r"
99122,"YES! It is super important information that is also very interesting. But it's our civil duty to understand this content. Our society is only as strong as the weakest links, in this case being the prison system.","r"
99122,"I would recommend this course to a student interested in psychology. It is relatively easy to do well, but as a non-psychology major, I became a little less interested in the course by the end of the semester.","r"
99122,"Yes!!!! AWESOME Professor, great TFs, and the content is super cool! Pretty chill class as well, so if you need a fifth credit or something, look no further!","r"
99122,"Absolutely. One of my favorite classes at yale.","r"
99122,"I would highly recommend this class to anyone, regardless of their major or current interests, as I think there are important humanitarian skills that are to be derived from this course.","r"
99122,"As a NSCI major, I thought there would be a bit more emphasis on the neuroscience aspect of the criminal mind, but there were a lot of lectures on the social issues of incarcerating these individuals, policing, and environment that I didn't necessarily expect. I think that the class is interesting, but it also seems to focus a lot on the professor's own research rather than concepts that can be applied more broadly.","neu"
99122,"Absolutely. Whether you are interested in psychology or not, you will learn lots.","r"
99122,"Yes! You learn so much and it opens your understanding to criminology. Although I personally didnt agree with the conclusions that were applied to Rea life situations, it was fascinating","r"
99122,"Absolutely. To the student who is just interested in the topicdefinitely. To the humanities student (AFAM, political science, etc.)it will relate to a lot of policy initiative and laws that are currently ineffective. Its great to think about the research and evidence behind the efficacy.","r"
99122,"Yes!! Lectures are very engaging.","r"
99122,"YES!! Best class at Yale so so interesting and professor Sommers is amazing!","r"
99122,"Yes! Its really interesting and accessible to all students.","r"
99122,"YES, this was an amazing course that every Yale student should take.","r"
99122,"Yes! The professor is amazing","r"
99122,"Yes, the material is super engaging and the average amount of work.","r"
99122,"Yes! Loved this class and professor baskin-sommers. So interesting and engaging. She was so nice and taught so well!","r"
99122,"YES.","r"
99122,"Yes! Absolutely must take","r"
99122,"Yes!","r"
99122,"Yes!! Really interesting, especially if you like neuroscience. If you dont like neuro, maybe reconsider.","r"
99122,"I would recommend this course to another student. Arielle makes her content very digestible. The real life case studies are fascinating.","r"
99122,"Yes, must take course with Baskin-Sommers.","r"
99122,"yes!!","r"
99122,"YesProfessor Baskin-Sommers is such an inspiring and engaging teacher. Also you learn about how to apply pysch and neuroscience to the real world in an important and impactful way.","r"
99122,"Yea, the course is very approachable for all students and very interesting.","r"
99122,"Yes I would. I think it is a fantastic way of making you think about the causes of crime and environmental factors which contribute.","r"
99122,"Absolutely! The material is fascinating, and you really get out of it what you put in.","r"
99122,"yes. It offers insight into important topics and Prof Baskin-sommers is amazing.","r"
99122,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because the lectures were very interesting and you learn a considerable amount.","r"
99122,"Yes, but make sure to go to lectures.","r"
99122,"Yes ABSOLUTELY. PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. You will learn so much.","r"
99122,"Prof is sooo nice","r"
99122,"Yes absolutely","r"
99122,"Yes, if you are interested in learning more about the criminal mind.","r"
99122,"100%, the professor is amazing and you can tell that she cares about having her students actually understand the content. She is fair and very understanding.","r"
99122,"Yes, I think it's a great course to learn about law-related and psychopathology concepts.","r"
99122,"yes, especially if they are interested in pursuing law or psychology this course is an important intersection of the two fields","r"
99122,"Yes, but not if you have already taken a few psych/neuro courses.","r"
99122,"Yes! Walked away from this class seeing the world differently!","r"
99122,"Yes! It was fascinating, both academically and good to know practically. Well organized and great professor.","r"
99122,"Yes, this was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale!","r"
99122,"I would recommend this course to another student. It was one of the first psychology courses I've taken at Yale and Professor Baskin-Sommers provided a lot of support for students.","r"
99122,"Yes. Definitely material everyone should learn to gain some perspective","r"
99122,"I would recommend this course. It is an insightful course that make you question what you think you know about crime.","r"
99122,"Yes, this is not a gut so you should expect to put in the work but you will learn a lot!","r"
99122,"YES!! If you can take this course, take it! I took it credit/d/fail because I already had a full schedule, but the assignments are fun to complete and were a super nice break from my regular stem-filled classes.","r"
99122,"yes! super interesting and workload is very manageable. awesome professor who cares about her students success and is very knowledgeable","r"
99122,"YES!! If you need a chill class, are interested in antisocial personality disorders, and/or want to learn a little bit about crime in the US, this class is a really fun and light addition. The quizzes are super easy and take like less than five minutes and the essays are from a template. The exams are not bad either as Professor Baskin-Sommers gives out study guides that are really helpful to study with a week or so before the exams","r"
99122,"Yes! Professor Baskin-Sommers is an excellent lecturer and very accessible. She put a ton of work into her class and it really shows in the content and lecture quality.","r"
99122,"Yes because I do believe it was really interesting and fun but again, this is not necessarily an easy class assignments are graded very tediously and sometimes that can be very discouraging and make engagement with the learning difficult.","r"
99122,"Absolutely recommend this class for psyc or non-psyc majors. Prof Baskin-Sommers is a fantastic lecturer and designed the course very well to cover a wide range of topics. Grading is clear and upfront, the rubric is easy to follow for each assignment, and workload is very manageable.","r"
99122,"I would recommend this to someone who likes psychology and is interested in seeing where it can be applied","r"
99122,"If your main interest is neuroscientific research on the workings of antisocial/psychopathic individuals' executive function, reward systems, and fear processing... go for it! This class is all about the minutia when it comes to understanding the research. But if you're interested in studying criminality more broadly, mass incarceration, juvenile advocacy, and social factors related to crime, this class is NOT for you. I recommend courses in the sociology, ER&M, or public health majors. We had some wonderful guest speakers come in to lecture that touched on these topics, but it was almost strange and awkward to then pivot to understanding one economic/attention task for the next four lectures. The research side of the class tended to be incredibly repetitive and hard to apply to real-world issues. I get that the essay assignments tried to make a research-to-real-world-connection, but they were hardly discussed in class. I think more time could have been dedicated to understanding current events around mass shootings or criminology (aka applying the research in-class), rather than creating optional discussion groups, which is what happened throughout the semester. Though the class title seems to cast a wide net (""The Criminal Mind"" sounds like it would encompass of many types of crime), Prof. Baskin-Sommers is very clear about what she does/doesn't cover in the course. A better title would be ""Neuroscience of Psychopathy and Antisociality""","r"
99122,"Yes, I think it is manageable, interesting, and unconventional. You will likely not find this kind of information in other places, and Prof. BS often presents her own research, which is really exciting to hear from the person who did the studies.","r"
99122,"Yes - fantastic course.","r"
99122,"Yes, I would, it was very interesting!","r"
99122,"Highly recommend, great course and professor","r"
99122,"Yes, do take this class if you're interested in legal justice system and factors that specifically cause crime. The content in general is super eye-opening and interesting. It's a bit more sciency than you might expect, which is a nice!","r"
99122,"ABSOLUTELY! If you're reading this right now, this is your sign to take this class! Best class ever with the most sincere, kind, and brilliant professor!","r"
99122,"Absolutely","r"
99122,"I recommend this course to everyone who is interested in psychology and law.","r"
99122,"Yes, if you need a social science gut and are interested in psychology.","r"
99122,"Yes!!! You learn so much without feeling immense amount of stress the entire semester. Professor Baskin-Sommers is amazing: she is organized and a good lecturer. The topics we covered were very interesting and I was always engaged in lecture. Every rubric was structured so you knew exactly what you needed to do to get a good grade. This is an amazing class.","r"
99122,"Yes, this was an eye-opening course.","r"
99122,"Yes. It's interesting and if you put in the work you'll do well.","r"
99122,"Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in criminal psychology or curious about why some people would commit crimes chronically. It debunks some common misconceptions about ""psychopaths"" and helps you understand the motivation and neuropsychological mechanisms underlying antisocial behavior.","r"
99122,"Yes! Very well structured, very clear course!","r"
99122,"Yes, if they're interested in psychology","r"
99122,"yeah it was a very interesting course and I learned a lot","r"
99122,"Yes! A great psychology/neuroscience class to take!","r"
99122,"I think this course gives an interesting overview of the criminal justice system/policy/certain parts of the brain that are relevant to the content. I wasnt as blown away as I thought I would be -- but I enjoyed it, and would recommend.","r"
99122,"Yes. It's an interesting psychology class on an important subject.","r"
99122,"Yes, I would recommend this course as it is well taught and has a lot of fascinating information that was great to learn about.","r"
99122,"I would highly recommend this course, especially for anyone interested in law or human rights of any kind. I found the semester very enjoyable.","r"
99122,"yes, but only if you really enjoy psychology and neuroscience, especially in regards to criminal justice system. i personally tried to take this as a gut, which in a way, it was through just less frequent work, but i found it more difficult to study for because there was so much content i was personally unfamiliar with prior to taking this course","r"
99122,"Yes! The professor is the best!","r"
99122,"Yes absolutely! It has been my favorite class at Yale so far. Such a great class that teaches fascinating material.","r"
99122,"Yes, but not if you are looking for a very in-depth psychology course.","r"
99122,"absolutely, everyone at yale has something to learn from and some way to grow from taking this course","r"
99122,"Yes! Such an interesting class, and it will automatically grab someone's interest. I think almost everyone would enjoy the class because of the subject and the way that it is taught.","r"
99122,"Yes absolutely if you are interested in psychology","r"
99122,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. However, I would warn them that if they think it is a gut, they should reconsider because it is not.","r"
99122,"Yes it was cool but not what I was anticipating","r"
99122,"Yes I think it was very interesting and information I would have never known.","r"
99122,"I would definitely recommend it! Make sure to follow the rubrics on the essays though or else it can end up being a stressful class.","r"
99122,"I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in neuroscience, psychology, or criminal law. If you are not a STEM major, this class may be a little more difficult since it is very science heavy and the essays require a very different way of thinking from what would be used for essays in other humanities or social science classes. Otherwise the content is very interesting and the difficulty is relatively mangeable if you stay on top of your work. There are also a lot of opportunities for extra credit or points back on exams.","r"
99122,"Yes, absolutely. The course is exciting and thought stimulating.","r"
99122,"100% yes!!! This was one of the best (if not the #1 best) course I've taken at Yale. The lectures were interesting, the content and the way it was presented was incredibly clear and engaging, and the workload was very low and manageable. TFs were insanely quick to hand out grades after the essays and exams (our final was graded within hours of taking it!) The studies from the readings were covered in detail during lecture, and if you just showed up to class and paid attention, it was easy to do well. And also, most importantly, the course is super fascinating! I feel like I learned way more in this course than almost any other Yale course, and it never felt like too much content to digest. It's a course I've very excitedly talked about with friends and family, and it's information I'm going to remember years from now. This course is honestly worth taking solely to have the opportunity to hear Professor Baskin-Sommers give lectures. She is an amazing, engaging, organized, cool, and funny lecturer and professor who cares A TON about the work she does inside and outside the classroom. The course is extraordinarily well-taught and fun, with an extraordinary professor to top it off!","r"
99122,"Yes. This class has very interesting content, and the guest lectures every so often were very fun to learn from.","r"
99122,"Yes! Especially if you are interested in criminal justice and psychopathy/psychological disorders related to criminal behavior.","r"
99122,"Yes, definitely. The course material was very interesting.","r"
99122,"Sure! Make sure you have a friend to motivate you to actually go, since it is easy to get by without attending lecture. Listening to Professor Baskin-Sommers talk about the key concepts of the class is a unique chance to hear from an expert in the field explaining content that is rarely looked at elsewhere, so I think it is more than worth it.","r"
99122,"Yes I would Professor Baskin was super engaging in lecture and you learn so much in one semester. She provided so many extra reading materials to go to if you wanted more.","r"
99122,"Absolutely. The subject by itself is incredibly fascinating and having Professor Baskin-Sommers as the lecturer only makes the course more enjoyable. The optional discussion sections accompanying the lectures also offered a great way to see how the topics we were discussing in class were used by psychologists in real-world scenarios.","r"
99122,"Yes! It was an amazing class. I really loved Professor Baskin-Sommers, and as a neuroscience major, the material brought a lot of what I study to real world applications and connected to social issues I am very interested in.","r"
99122,"100%","r"
99122,"Absolutely. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale with one of my favorite professors. It's the type of class where you are learning without even realizing you are learning. And the topics that we discuss are so important and actually have an impact on people in the world. 10/10 recommend.","r"
99122,"No. Topic sounds interesting but didnt feel like we really went that in depth, just a surface level dive into various different potential factors that seem intuitive anyway.","dr"
99122,"I would, the content is interesting and the professor is very good at giving interesting lectures.","r"
99122,"Yes, it was very interesting.","r"
99122,"Absolutely. Prof Baskin Sommers is an eloquent, knowledgeable professor with an ability to engage with her students. I learned so much during this course and find myself better to explain some of the fundamental aspects of crime, mental health, and their neurological and environmental underpinnings.","r"
99122,"Yes, if you are going to engage with the content. This class changed how I perceive personality disorders and the fairness of the criminal legal system, and led me to be more attentive to how systems interact with each other and with the individual. If you engage with the material fully, it will make you think critically and consider your opinions on the state of psychology as a discipline, the criminal legal system, and what justice really means.","r"
99122,"I would highly recommend this class to other students. I think it is taught really well and there is a lot of information that makes you think about people with mental disorders differently than you would if you did not take the class.","r"
99122,"Yes, I loved this class and thought it was the most interesting course I have taken at Yale.","r"
99122,"Yes, it is very interesting and unique","r"
99122,"YES YES YES. I would definitely recommend this course. It has something for everyone no matter the major.","r"
99122,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!","r"
99122,"Yes absolutely the content is so interesting and the prof really makes you feel engaged.","r"
99122,"Yes - this is a great course for anyone interested in psychology or criminal justice. The workload is very low.","r"
99123,"I would reccommend if you find the lecture material interesting, however it is a lot of work when preparing for the exams so be able to manage that!","r"
99123,"Definitely. A good psychology science credit","r"
99123,"only those with neuroscience background or willingness to put in a LOT of extra time studying","neu"
99123,"No. Even though the subject matter is genuinely intriguing, the overall experience of the class has been dampened by issues that have made it challenging to navigate, even for some neuroscience majors. Unfortunately, several ended up either dropping the course or opting for a credit/d/fail option.  The administrative aspect of the course has been a significant source of stress. While the professor advocates for a learning-centered approach, emphasizing that grades are not paramount, the course structure seems to contradict this philosophy. The frequency of quizzes and exams, in conjunction with the requirement to write a paper and complete creative assignments, suggests a high-stakes, grade-focused environment. This disparity has created a sense of ambiguity and insecurity among the students.  Compounding this issue is the seemingly arbitrary nature of how certain elements of the course are managed. For instance, a set of quizzes was abruptly removed from the syllabus without a clear explanation, and the feedback on our work is often delayed or vague. This lack of clarity has led to confusion and heightened anxiety about performance and expectations.  Moreover, the classroom environment, both in-person and online, has occasionally felt uncomfortable due to certain behaviors exhibited by the professor. Instances in which the professor singles out students, requesting them to be quiet with the assertion that ""other students can hear them,"" have created tension, especially when the targeted students were not noticeably disruptive. Such experiences have unfortunately led to a sense of intimidation, deterring some of us from active participation despite our interest in the course material.  A disproportionate amount of time is spent on ""questions"" slides than actual content slides. When questioned about her teaching methodology, the professor tends to respond defensively rather than taking it as constructive feedback.   On a brighter note, the Teaching Fellows as well as the professor hold many office hours to facilitate student learning.","dr"
99123,"I found that it is a very interesting course and I would recommend it to someone who needs a requirement filled.","r"
99123,"Honestly, no. Unless you are extremely intent on learning this specific information, you must be ready to put in the work and deal with the disorganization. The feedback I got from the course was extremely lacking, I thought the timing of canvas quizzes was random and unfair, and I felt that the lectures moved WAY too fast to learn from. I always had to go and read the textbook, even if I was paying attention in lectures. It is a lot of work, with an essay and three exams.","dr"
99123,"Yes! If you're not taking it C/D/F be prepared to study for exams, it's a lot of information (but totally doable). I think this is a great course not just for neuro or psych majors but just for humans in general. I learned a lot that can now help me make more informed decisions about what I want to consume. It's not DARE-style scare tactics and has some actually really useful information. Honestly, I'd take this course just for Prof. Hedy Kober, she's AMAZING-- so knowledgable about everything and so willing to help you with whatever you need.","r"
99123,"I would recommend this course if you're actually interested in the biological processes surrounding drug use and do not mind learning and remembering a lot of details.","r"
99123,"I would 100% recommend this class to someone, it is easily my favorite course I have taken at Yale and I would encourage anyone who is interested in the content to take the class","r"
99123,"Yes, if this is content that interests you, and perhaps if you already have some background in neuroscience and some sense of how drugs work. As much as the course is structured for people who have no science background, there is A LOT of content and it goes REALLY quickly, so just be prepared. A very very science-y science credit :)","r"
99123,"NO NO NO!!! Do NOT take this class unless you are a neuroscience major. It is the farthest thing from a gut and really misrepresented on the syllabus. This is not at all an introductory class and without prior neuroscience knowledge, it will be incredibly difficult to keep up. The professor speaks so quickly in lecture and barely explains anything yet refuses to post the recordings so you only have her kinda confusing slides to study off of. Everything up until the first mid term is pure neuroscience and even after that, you only learn about drugs in the context of neuroscience which is so much less interesting than you would expect. I am not actually walking out of this class with a better understanding of if I should or should not take certain drugs, I know only know what neurotransmitters and receptors each drug affects. Her exams are so ridiculous, and she asks the most niche, specific questions of all time. It is an extraordinary amount of content you are supposed to know for each exam (most people's study guides were 40+ pages). You also don't even have weekly psets or homework which (surprisingly) I really wish we had. The only work outside of the three exams is a paper due during reading week (so yes you have a paper and final during finals) and you also never get to see your graded exams unless you want to wait in office hours to see it on her computer. There is no way to check your comprehension of the content week by week and it's super easy to fall behind. Moreover, you have no practice to really go off when studying for exams. She doesn't post past finals and only released practice questions for the midterms (she didn't even post any for the final) at like 6pm the night before. Your only way to study is memorizing her 100 slides per lecture.","dr"
99123,"Yes! Just be prepared for very involved discussions every class.","r"
99123,"This is an interesting class, and you learn a lot of cool stuff. It is not a gut though! You will have to memorize a lot of details.","neu"
99123,"I think this course contains a lot of important and interesting information, and I found myself talking about the lectures to my friends pretty much every week. However, I think it can be difficult. Usually workload is very low, but the exams require a fair amount of preparation. The TF review sessions were not helpful, there were study questions, but without answers, and study materials were not uploaded until a day or two before the exams. Professor Kober also speaks very quickly, so sometimes it was hard to get all the notes down, especially since sometimes the slides don't include all the information she says. However, there is a supposedly generous curve, and the content was pretty easy to memorize once you had it. I recommend the course if you don't have a difficult workload otherwise, especially if you already have some background in neuroscience.","r"
99123,"I'm not sure I would. I really loved the material, and I think people would benefit from it. However, it was a stressful course that didn't need to be so!","dr"
99123,"ABSOLUTELY! This is knowledge that will enhance your human experience and information you'll carry with you for the rest of your life, in some way shape or form. Drugs are all around us, legal and illicit, both in use and related to policy, so it's important to be knowledgeable about them.","r"
99123,"No unless youre comfortable with brain neurotransmission","dr"
99123,"No, I would definitely not recommend this course to another student. It seemed the topics would be interesting, but I found it very hard to link any of the information or get tested on it in a fair way.","dr"
99123,"Yes, I would. The course is very interesting and you learn so much about drugs that are everywhere. I would not say this is a gut though; the exams are somewhat difficult (but fair), so be prepared to study a bit, and the lectures move quickly.","r"
99123,"Yes, if you're interested in the topic and don't mind science and memorization.","r"
99123,"Yes, if you need a science credit that is not to hard, but still want to learn this is a good class. It is not hard to become invested in this class, the content is super interesting.","r"
99123,"I would recommend this course to students with an interest in neuroscience (more than just an interest in psychology) and who are able to keep up with fast-paced lectures and dont mind exams.","r"
99123,"Only if you are prepared to work hard for it and are interested in this topic. I didn't take this as a gut, but I struggled.","neu"
99123,"Yes! The content was so engaging and I liked the format. It's also relatively easy. I took it as my science credit and really enjoyed it!","r"
99123,"This is a good Science requirement credit, but very hard if you don't have a background in chemistry or biology.","neu"
99123,"Yes! The class is interesting and relevant to our real lives, since drugs are ubiquitous nowadays. However, there is a lot of information to memorize in order to do well in the exams, so you will need to really understand the material. Some prior knowledge of neuroscience would be helpful, although not required.","r"
99123,"If traditional lecture-style courses work for you, I think that this is a decent course to take. It's an incredibly interesting topic, but absorbing the course's content requires a LOT of self-guided work. It is by no means a gut for a science credit, although it is one of the cooler science credit courses to take. I really wish the educational pedagogy of the course were different because I would have really loved this class had it been structured better to facilitate student learning.","neu"
99123,"I absolutely loved this class. I am a global affairs major and the last science class I took was Bio the World and Us 3 years ago. This class was definitely challenging for me but I loved the challenge. Unlike most of my other writing, reading and Econ classes at Yale, this content is really digestible. Its just a lot to memorize and put together, but you can get a sense of what will be on the tests with the practice questions and not be blindsided by anything. Unlike challenging Econ or math tests, there wont be a question that you just stare at and have no idea how to start. It was a different way of using my brain and I really enjoyed the change up. Its just a ton of memorizing. I studied a ton for the first test; probably 12-15 hours of focused time, and did well.   The first 3 or so weeks of the class I was super overwhelmed with new content; genuinely 30-40% of the words said in lecture referred to parts of the brain I had never heard before and systems I didnt know existed. I walked out of every one of the first few lectures super lost. It got better as I reviewed more outside of class and as the semester went on. Its not a gut, but I was taking five courses and genuinely enjoyed this class a lot.","r"
99123,"I would recommend this course to any student who has an interest in the neurobiology/science of drugs, and who isn't afraid of denser lectures with science-heavy terminology.","r"
99123,"No, unless you are good at memorizing small, specific details or are passionate about neuroscience","dr"
99123,"Yes, if you want to invest a lot of your time into learning interesting things about drugs. I would not recommend it for a science gut; it is NOT a gut.","r"
99123,"Absolutely. Take this course. The course is certainly challenging, but it is very fair. In addition, this class is genuinely one of the most important courses I've taken in my academic career you'll learn important information about how drugs work in your brain, and I came away from the course with life-saving information. It's an interesting and engaging course, and generally a great time.","r"
99123,"I would! I learned so much, more so than an easier science class. It was hard but worth it","r"
99123,"I would definitely recommend this course to a NSCI/PSYC major, but if you are simply thinking about taking this class as a science distributional, please consider that it will be a challenge. However, you learn so much about drugs and really rethink your previous misconceptions about drugs.","r"
99123,"If you CR/D","neu"
99123,"Yes, if youre looking for an interesting science credit. Keep in mind that this is definitely not a gut","r"
99123,"if theyre willing to put in extra time to learn things and teach themselves / work with other students then yea - the material is interesting! it is a lot of neuroscience though!","r"
99123,"Read if you are thinking of taking for the science credit: this class is difficult. If you have no neuro experience, you will struggle. You'll learn a ton, but there is so much info that she breezes through very quickly that if you do not have the background knowledge it will be very difficult to learn. The class is super interesting though, so you should definitely credit/D it. This was my first SC credit spring of sophomore year, so I didn't have the option to do so which I regretted. Definitely one of those classes that would be much more enjoyable without the pressure of the grade. Incredibly interesting nonetheless.","neu"
99123,"Nope. Science background required to do well.","dr"
99123,"Yes! It both increased my interest in neuroscience and provided information useful to everyday life.","r"
99123,"No, not unless they are going into biochemistry.","dr"
99123,"yes, for a science credit if you have an interest in neuro/psych/drugs topics and you are familiar with the exam type used in the psych department but if not, it can be hard to gain your footing","r"
99123,"Yes, I think this is one of the most interesting classes at Yale, and there is a lot of practical knowledge to be gained from this course.","r"
99123,"Yes, if youre interested in learning how neurons and drugs work, along with their risks.  No, if youre interested in drug policy/history. Really weak on that front.","r"
99123,"I would absolutely recommend it. I would say that if you're new to neuroscience, as I was, be prepared for the first month or so to feel a little bit overwhelmingyou're getting a TON of information on basics in neurotransmission and how neurons work and what the various parts of the brain are etc. thrown at you, and a lot of other students have taken The Human Brain or comparable courses before this one. But if you power through, this course is SO rewarding and you'll leave with this really satisfying feeling that you Learned So Much, and such useful and interesting information!","r"
99123,"Yes, if the material is interesting to you, and you have some kind of background in it. However, I would not take it if this is your first introduction to neuroscience, and you don't have tons of time to commit to the subject. The material is not really introductory, and the class moves super quickly. It is interesting, but I was not prepared to devote the time necessary to do super well.","neu"
99123,"Yes. Its very interesting. Very heavy workload on exam weeks as theres a ton of content. Be willing to put in a lot of time. But knowing about drugs and the brain is VERY rewarding.","r"
99123,"I would recommend it. As someone with no neuroscience background, I felt the material was presented intuitively. Everyone should take this class if interested.","r"
99123,"If you have taken the human brain, go ahead. If not, I would be cautious. The course requires a lot of memorization of receptors, neurotransmitters, etc. Without the foundation of an introductory neuroscience course, it is a lot to take in at once and hard to do really well in the class","neu"
99123,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially Neuroscience and Psychology majors, BUT not if you have had no prior background knowledge of the brain. It is advertised as through it is beginner friendly, but I promise that its not. I was really excited to register for this course and to take it as a freshman, but now I regret taking it without taking The Human Brain or Neurobiology first. This was but my experience though.","r"
99123,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a student. Just keep in mind that a decent amount of studying will be required.","r"
99123,"Please don't take this class if you're looking for a gut science credit and you're not majoring in or (deeply) interested in Neuroscience.","dr"
99123,"I would recommend this class to anyone interested in drugs or neuroscience. I absolutely loved this class and found it very useful for college life, and it made the content feel meaningful and worthwhile. However, there is an extraordinary amount of content covered in every lecture, and a lot of it ends up being memorization of small details. I actually enjoyed studying for the exams because I liked the content, but if this class doesnt interest you, studying would kind of suck. Dont take this class unless youre prepared to show up to lecture and pay attention, because lecture recordings arent shared with the class and Hedy talks so quickly that she sounds normal in half speed on playback. Although the course was not always the most well-run, it was very cool, engaging, and relevant, so I would definitely recommend it. There really aren't enough courses like this at Yale","r"
99123,"I would only recommend this course to someone with a strong science (and esp. neuroscience) background. I believe the claim that this course is accessible to people of all experience levels is a fallacious one.","r"
99123,"I would, with the caveat that this course is not a GUT. There are a lot of really valuable insights in this course that every college students should know about drugs and drug use. The course was interesting, and I learned a lot about how the brain works that I'm already applying to my life.","r"
99123,"Yes but would not say it is a gut. There is so much information","r"
99123,"Only if they've already taken a neuroscience class. Most people in this class seemed to have done so and I felt behind from the start because I hadn't.","neu"
99123,"Yes. I think every yale student should take a course like this. Though if you are not premed I would recommend pass failing it.","r"
99123,"Not really, unless you are very interested in the topic and have a background in neuroscience. DO NOT take this for an ""easy"" or ""fun"" science credit.","dr"
99123,"I would recommend this course. Professor Kober's expertise in this field is unmatched and the ability to learn from someone with her background is a great privilege. The content of the class is very interesting and Kober makes herself available for students to ask all sorts of questions regarding content and personal experience.","r"
99123,"Definitely! Super interesting for all majors. And professor Kober is amazing","r"
99123,"No, unless you are extremely into drugs. There is a lot of memorization and it is often unclear what is going to be covered in exams. Many concepts are not fully explained and the way the assignments and exams are structured do not facilitate the learning.","dr"
99123,"YES! Its so interesting and empowering. Its such a unique experience to get to learn about drugs in an academic setting. Im not a science person at Yale and it turned out to be my favorite class here!!","r"
99123,"I would recommend this course to another student with the caveat that they need to be really really prepared to work hard for it and study a ton. I wouldn't recommend this course at all to someone who's a non-STEM major looking for a STEM gut. I'd only take this course if you have the capacity to put the work in.","r"
99123,"If you want to learn about the science of drugs yes. If you are looking for a science gut, then no.","neu"
99123,"Yes, I thought the material was interesting.","r"
99136,"Yes, especially if you take it with MDR. If you haven't taken a philosophy course before, you really should take this one!","r"
99136,"I would recommend this course to anyone and everyone. There is no reason I can find to not take this course.","r"
99136,"I definitely recommend this class, even for non-majors!! The material is just extremely interesting, and the class is not really stressful.","r"
99136,"yes very interesting intro class","r"
99136,"Yes, for all the reasons discussed above. Fantastic intro-level philosophy lecture. Knowledgable and caring professor. Ample opportunities for support. Intellectually exciting material.","r"
99136,"If you're looking for an accessible and enjoyable introduction to philosophy or a relatively lax humanities credit, this course is for you. Two short papers and one final make for a lower workload than most Yale classes. However, this also means that your grade will be heavily reliant on just a few assignments. Getting feedback from MDR and your TF on your essay is likely a must if you want an A. I took this course Credit/D/Fail just to explore and didn't have to worry about this much. If you're a first-year with expiring Credit/D/Fails and want a chill fifth class, this is it. Just note that this class is primarily about metaphysics instead of other areas of philosophy like ethics, philosophy of mind, etc.","r"
99136,"Yes! This class only has 2 essays, in comparison to 3 essay in 125. I find this class to be more interesting than ancient philosophy, personally. Lectures are very engaging, and MDR is wonderful at encouraging questions and responding to them. He's a stellar philosopher in his field.","r"
99136,"Yes","r"
99136,"Yes, if they want to know the basics of modern philosphy.","r"
99136,"i would recommend this class to someone already familiar with engaging with philosophy and writing philosophy papers","r"
99136,"I would recommend this course to anyone with a genuine interest in philosophy, especially ideas such as naturalism, essentialism, necessitarianism, etc.","r"
99136,"No- Focused so much on metaphysics and is definitely not an overview of modern philosophy","dr"
99136,"Yes - the things I learned in this course brought a whole new perspective of philosophy which I was previously unaware of. Beyond the topics themselves, I believe this course helped me immensely in critical/logical thinking, as well as writing philosophy papers. The course is as boring or as exciting as you make it out to be, so it is quite self-directed. I encourage future students of this course to take initiative to reach out to MDR/TFs if you really want to improve. Being lazy with course will lead to poor performance.","r"
99136,"Yes. The material is very interesting. The course helps you build writing skills. And lecturers were fun and engaging.","r"
99136,"I would, but only if you are willing to do your readings and pay attention in lecture. If you do, you'll get a lot out of it, but if not, not really.","neu"
99136,"Absolutely. Della-Rocca is a great, passionate, and intelligent lecturer. If you have any interest at all in the modern philosophers on the syllabus I definitely recommend this course as its the perfect introduction to their ways of thinking.","r"
99136,"I'd recommend the class if you like metaphysics or are interested in trying out philosophy. The lectures were interesting and I came away with a general overview of different modern philosophers.","r"
99136,"Yes, if they are interested in that era of philosophy I think it is a good introduction.","r"
99136,"Yes, the professor is excellent.","r"
99136,"I would recommend this to another student if they are very interested philosophy. This class is a lot of reading, so take if prepared to do the readings.","r"
99136,"Yes. I am not a philosophy student nor did I think I was interested in philosophy. I took this course and by the end felt very challenged but that I also learned a lot and improved my writing and thinking greatly.","r"
99136,"Yes! Good intro course to modern philosophy","r"
99136,"yes if you want to know about the beliefs of these philosophers. the information wasnt actually that interesting","r"
99136,"Yes! I think this is a great survey course for an arts and humanities credit if you are no where near a philosophy major, but super interesting if you are a philosophy major as well.","r"
99136,"Definitely.","r"
99136,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in philosophy! It is a fun intro course and you really learn about the thought systems of a wide range of philosophers","r"
99136,"Yes. It is an insightful course that allows you to explore the philosophical thinking and arguments of pioneer philosophers in a clear and compelling way.","r"
99136,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. MDR is a great lecturer and makes the class interesting and engaging. Questions are welcomed and answered thoroughly, and the discussion sections allow you to flesh out some of the more complicated ideas. A lot of ""prerequisite"" classes at Yale are boring or arduous, but this class was genuinely interesting and fun.","r"
99136,"Yes- this course provides a great insight to early philosophical thought and MDR makes the class engaging and interesting.","r"
99136,"Yes! The course provides an introduction to several different philosophers and by the end of the semester, you can get a good understanding of their main ideas","r"
99136,"Yes, this was my first philosophy course, and I would encourage anyone to take this class since it will change the way you think youll learn to question your assumptions and ask why questions that you wouldnt have thought of asking before. As this is an intro course, I liked that we had the opportunity to learn about the views of multiple philosophers. However, if youre looking to focus on ethics/morality or particular philosophers, this probably isnt the best course for you. MDRs lectures are amazing and convey the material in the readings in a way that is much more concise and comprehensible. Go to his office hours if you can! Readings are light, but expect to devote a significant amount of time for the two papers.","r"
99136,"Yes if you are specifically interested in the philosophers studied and in metaphysics .","r"
99136,"If you're very interested in metaphysics, then yes. This class is not, however, an ethics class. You will not be discussing the trolley problem. Instead, you'll be discussing whether the physical world is real and if the mind and body are distinct.","neu"
99136,"Yes, if they are interested in modern philosophy.","r"
99136,"Yes, if you are interested in philosophy and want an introduction to major ideas","r"
99136,"Yes I definitely would because it helps get a taste for philosophy, even when you start with zero knowledge of it.","r"
99136,"Totally this course is awesome for someone with not much experience with philosophy","r"
99136,"Absolutely. The readings are interesting, lectures are engaging, and Professor Della Rocca is incredible.","r"
99136,"I would recommend this course, especially to students who aren't strong in humanities; it provides great exposure to philosophy.","r"
99136,"Definitely. If you're considering the major, definitely take this course early. If not, I still strongly recommend you take this course. You'll be fascinating by the ideas of the philosophers and will likely enjoy dissecting and evaluating their arguments. It's no easy task, although it's well worth your effort.","r"
99136,"I would recommend this course to any student genuinely fascinated by philosophical ideas and questions, and who will actually do all the readings. The class is such a rich experience if you allow yourself the time and space to be fully immersed in the ideas and questions. After all, philosophy is supposed to refer to life as we experience it. It is incredibly important to be comfortable questioning things, and meet new ideas with a sense of openness and with a calm and inquisitive nature. If you truly are interested in the content, take the course. If you are solely looking for a writing credit and don't plan on doing many of the readings, you will get nothing but frustration and dissatisfaction out of this course, when the alternative is a rich, thoughtful, meaningful experience. You get out of this course what you put in.","r"
99136,"yes! MDR is a great lecturer and this course is a great overview to basic philosophical questions (mostly metaphysics though) as well as the answers modern thinkers tried to come up with to respond to them","r"
99136,"Yes. Great into to philosophy. Lecture but feels like seminar.","r"
99136,"yes! great understanding of modern phil, wide range of (western) authors.","r"
99136,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I think it is an excellent introduction to philosophy for those who have never taken a philosophy class (like myself) since you read a range of different texts and learn about many foundational thinkers from Descartes to Kant. This class also made me think about the world in many new ways.","r"
99136,"Yes, I would. I wish this was a writing credit because I think it would encourage more students to join the class. But I found it very interesting and would tell anyone who wants to think more deeply about philosophy but has a basic knowledge should take the class.","r"
99136,"Yes! I really loved Dr. MDR! He is really funny and I loved how he taught the course with demonstrations on the board. I thoroughly enjoyed the readings too. He answered as many questions as he can in class and was incredibly helpful and kind. If he is teaching other courses, I hope to take as many as I can. 11/10!!","r"
99136,"Take this class! This was a really fun intro to Philosophy, and it convinced me that I should take more classes in the major.","r"
99136,"Absolutely, it was a great class if you are looking to learn a lot about modern philosophy.","r"
99136,"Yes, I would. I think I might have found the material of a moral or political philosophy course a little more exciting in itself, but MDR's excellent lectures made up for it. Between the good lectures, manageable readings, and reasonable workload, I really liked this class. I took this class with a few friends, and that definitely made it better than if I'd taken it alone. I also recomment going to MDR's office hours, if you have the time.","r"
99136,"I would recommend a more specific course to students who aren't pursuing the philosophy major since this class moves pretty fast.","neu"
99136,"Yes. Great course to take if you want to test your basic level of interest in philosophy.","r"
99136,"I would if they are interested in philosophy but if not I would not recommend this course because it is not super engaging if you are not interested in the topic.","neu"
99136,"Yes, although I think that Philosophy/Humanities majors will get more out of this course than others. Most of the theories discussed are quite bizarre and seemingly implausible (e.g. Leibniz's monad-based idealism or Spinoza's monism) and are thus helpful insofar as they are demonstrations of highly complex and well thought-out argumentation rather than intuitively-backed ways of looking at the world. The content can seem overly technical and removed from real life at times. So, for those looking for a solid foundation for further philosophical exploration, this class is a must; but, for those simply seeking to dip their toes in the pool of philosophy I might recommend something else.","r"
99136,"Yes, because I believe philosophical thought is a fantastic tool. It is helpful in many disciplines and is much more important to the real world than people think.","r"
99136,"Yes, especially if MDR is teaching. Just know going into it that this is a class primarily focused on metaphysics and epistemology.","r"
99145,"no.","dr"
99145,"I would if the student is sure they are interested in philosophy, and if they have a background in other philosophy courses.","r"
99145,"No unless it is required for your major. I think the grading is incredibly unfair. GPA matters for a lot of grad schools and you shouldn't have to turn in grad-level work to get an A on a paper.","dr"
99145,"I would recommend this course to another student as long as they have time for it. The papers will take time even though they are 5-pages because you have to follow a certain format and you have to make sure that you're really thinking through your argument. I would suggest trying to follow a thought-process that your TF would agree with (go to their OHs religiously if you end up taking this class!) because they are the ones grading and advocating for you when Professor Kagan brings all the TFs together.","r"
99145,"It depends what matters to you. If you're looking to take an interesting class and one that you'll probably think about long after it ends, you should. If you're gonna spend the whole time stressing about your grades, I wouldn't. Obviously, if it's a prereq/requirement for your major this isn't super relevant.","neu"
99145,"Yes. It is a fun course, especially going to discussion section after hearing Kagan's lectures","r"
99145,"For anyone interested in moral philosophy, I would 100% recommend this course (maybe take in Credit/D/F if you're worried about your GPA).","r"
99145,"No. Take it if it's a pre-req. This class could literally be three sheets of notes and I would feel just as smart.","dr"
99145,"Yes. Essays aren't that difficult, as long as you make sure you meet with your TA often, and that you really understand what a philosophical essay is actually like. Find out exactly what your TA is expecting of you, and the class will be a relatively stress-free and enjoyable experience.","r"
99145,"It's a great course that you should take, so long as you're sufficiently interested in the material to pay attention in the lectures.","r"
99145,"yes a good intro class","r"
99145,"Absolutely. If you want a class that you know you will get an A in, dont take it. If you want to learn, grow, and understand Western ethics at its root, take this class.","r"
99145,"I would if it is credit/d/failed","r"
99145,"Does your heart burn with a desire to consider what really matters? Do you feel duty bound, or emotionally pulled, towards thinking ethics is one of the most important things you could possibly try to learn? If so, you should take this class, and it doesn't really matter what major or year you're in. Just take it.  This class will not give you an answer to ethics; all it will do is raise more questions (assuming you haven't already asked them yourself). But it will give you a better idea of what the important questions are, and how to think about them. If you put in effort on the papers, you will also learn to think better.  If you mostly want an interesting class or some kind of credit, I can't really assess whether you should take this class, because that's not why I took it. It's not very much work if you credit/d and don't really try to do well. But why would you do that? Are you really going to choose ethics as the course not to take seriously?  You ought to behave ethically, and to do that you ought to figure out what ""behaving ethically"" means, and so therefore it seems you ought to do something like taking this class. You can start thinking about ethics in many ways, but most of them don't come with the side effect of a Yale College course credit or discussions with Shelly Kagan.","r"
99145,"Absolutely. You get out of this class what you put into it. I loved it. Take good notes and do not take notes on a computer. It really helped me to conceptualize the lectures to write on paper.","r"
99145,"Yes - great course and Shelly is amazing","r"
99145,"No. Not at all.","dr"
99145,"Intro to Ethics is without a doubt a 10/10 course I would recommend to any other student. I would go as far as to say it should be required for all Yale students to take at some point in their time here. Shelly Kagan is famous for his harsh grading, and while there is some truth to this, most papers are graded by your TAs so you will probably receive a fair grade.","r"
99145,"Would recommend this course if you are planning to take it credit/d/fail.","r"
99145,"I would. The class is not nearly as hard as rumored (as long as you have your TF read your outlines). Kagan is also a very good/ clear lecturer and the paper topics are fun to write about.","r"
99145,"I would recommend, with the caveat that it is really hard to get a good grade in the course, and so it might be good to take it Credit/D/Fail to avoid stress. At the same time, the harder you work on the assignments, the more you learn.","r"
99145,"Yes with the intention of credit D-ing the class. Although the topic is interesting, very little is done to help us understand the intricacies of the ideologies. The professor claims at the very beginning of class that many of us will not know how to write a philosophy paper and will do poorly on the first one. Yet, TAs and professor do very little to address paper writing and help through the process. Rather, we are left just failing with little feedback.","r"
99145,"I kind of just randomly decided to take this course and it was very worthwhile. Definitely not easy, but worth the time.","r"
99145,"Its a good class to find out if you are interested in formal philosophy, because it requires a lot of abstract thought. I still like philosophy but realized that majoring in it is not for me from this course","r"
99145,"Not unless you have to take it","dr"
99145,"No, not unless it is a prerequesite. It is not designed for learning and is a bad introduction to philosophy.","dr"
99145,"Sure for a major req - for fun if you are ready to commit","r"
99145,"I would. I think the topics we discussed were interesting and important and Shelly does a good job of walking you through the material in an engaging way. I also think the sections are a great place to exercise your critical thinking and discussion skills and both section and the papers provided us with the opportunity to do philosophy rather than hear what some dead, old, white people have had to say. I will say, try to find someones old sample successful paper if you can, because I think the guidance going into the first paper isnt enough to know what theyre looking for.","r"
99145,"Yes, for pre-requisite and to learn more about ethics","r"
99145,"I would recommend this course to another student. The class opened my eyes to moral ways of thinking I had never considered. However, I would classify it as a challenging course.","r"
99145,"Yes! This is a great intro course to learning about ethics and morality. Shelly does a great job of keeping students engaged and interested during lectures.","r"
99145,"I would and already have. Well, I would at least recommend that they take at least some course with Professor Kagan, even if it's not Ethics. That man is electric, and even though he's the ""hardest grader at Yale,"" that's reconciled several times over by his lecturing capabilities, not to mention that his philosophy behind being such a difficult grader is understandable.","r"
99145,"Yes. I think it's a great quintessential Yale course. Professor Kagan is an incredible lecturer and the fact that he teaches so fluidly (no notes, logical progression of themes) make it a different class than most, as well as a fun challenge.","r"
99145,"Yes, but be wary of the grading policy. Its common advice to take the class credit/d/fail, which I would agree with.","r"
99145,"If you want to do intro ethics, do it to it.","neu"
99145,"No!! Stay away. I hated this class. Grading was incredibly inconsistent. Your grade depends on almost entirely on what teaching assistant you get, so good luck. During lecture, no one paid attention. Everyone was shopping online or doing other homework. PRO TIP: Just create a Google doc, share it with a bunch of friends in the course, and take turns taking notes. That way, only one person at a time has to listen to Shelly Kagan's rambling, and your time will be (fortunately) better spent doing other things.","dr"
99145,"Absolutely. Especially so with my TA. Section was something that I found myself looking forward to every week. The section for this course has to be my favorite class I have taken in all of Yale so far.","r"
99145,"If you know how to write an ethics paper going in, you will have a good time. If you are bad at writing, then be warned there is very little support. Ironically for a introductory course, you will not be told what makes a good philosophical argument or what makes a good ethics paper. What makes the class difficult is simply figuring out what an ethics paper is because no one will tell you. The thinking and philosophy is fun but not when it comes to the essays.","neu"
99145,"Yes, if you wish to learn about morality and ethics this is probably the best way to do it. Worse case scenario, you CDF it and itll be one of the most worthy courses to use one of those. However, choose your section very carefully, since the TA single handedly determines your grade. The papers are definitely harshly graded but if you seek sufficient guidance from your TA and regularly follow lecture, I dont believe it should be hard for anyone to receive a reasonable grade (B+) in the course but if you wish for more, it would require some good amount of dedication but all you need to demonstrate is your ability to individually present unique and critical analyses.","r"
99145,"Yes highly","r"
99145,"yes, but know it is hard and requires a lot of commitment. if you are interested in ethics though, you should definitely take it","r"
99145,"Yes. As described above, my essay writing skills improved significantly over the course of the semester. While reviewing my essays, I learned how to read from the perspective of an ""outsider"" who knew nothing of the subject, and made sure to define, elaborate on, and clarify what might make sense to me as a student but was actually difficult to understand from someone not versed in philosophy. I think that this skill can be applied to all forms of essay writing, and that's why I think that even stem majors would take a lot out of this course. This course also introduced me to various theories of how the world works, some of which I spent days on afterwards just trying to wrap my head around, such as determinism. I had never considered the morality in my daily life and what system I use to justify what I do - it was usually just what felt right. Having a list of moral theories encouraged me to reflect on my motivation for acting as I do, and I think that this type of self reflection should be experienced by everyone.","r"
99145,"Yes, absolutely! Simply because Shelly is such an incredible lecturer. Even if you're not interested in the content, I think you'll find the course interesting just because of his lecturing. But if you're not convinced, do yourself a favor and show up to at least one of his lectures before you graduate. Another great thing about this course is that you get good feedback on your essays, and learning how to write a tight argument is an invaluable skill. People will complain about the harsh grading, but if you put in the work (internalizing what you learned in class, spending a lot of time thinking about your paper, maybe rewriting it) and talk to your TF, then I think you can get a decent grade. He also counts your later essays for more if you show improvement. So please don't let grading be the thing that stops you from taking the class. Lastly, it's a good idea to spend some time thinking about the nature of morality (utilitarianism isn't as crazy as it seems).","r"
99145,"If they want an easy class, no. If they want an intro ethics class, yes. If it has nothing to do with their major, no.","neu"
99145,"yes","r"
99145,"I am unsure if I would recommend this course to other students for the sake of being an introduction course. The standards felt unrealistically high for an introduction course. Knowing nothing about philosophy and then taking this course, I feel inclined to step further away from it.","dr"
99145,"Overall, yes, because of the fantastic lectures and because this course intellectually challenged me like no other course Ive taken at Yale. But be warned about the grading. Also, note that its not just papers: Section is also graded based on the quality of your participation. I get why Shelly does this, but also, be prepared for sections that feel adversarial because of it.   (Also, maybe this is just the nature of philosophy, but the class being graded largely based on papers means how well you understand the material isnt that highly correlated with your grade. Rather, its about whether your TF liked your take on a few slices of the material in your papers. This might work in your favor, but its worth knowing.)","r"
99200,"If you are in a biology major and need physics but are not super into it or into math, definitely go for it. I would also recommend it for people without a strong physics or math background that are looking for a science. Overall, a great course!","r"
99200,"Yes for premed req is great","r"
99200,"I would recommend this course to a student interested in learning about how physics relates to biology.","r"
99200,"Yes absolutely if you need physics for a life sciences major take 170/171!!","r"
99200,"if premed or need for major and don't love math","neu"
99200,"Yes, yes, and a thousand times yes. I don't want to see any pre-med students in 180/181. As someone who's done both, I promise you there is no class where you will learn like 170/171.","r"
99200,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to any and all other pre-meds. This class is specifically designed for premed (so if you're not a pre-med you're probably better off in 180). As compared to 180, the math is way easier and the exams are straightforward. The class targets things you'll specifically see on the MCAT. If you're a pre-med deciding between physics 180 vs. 170, I highly recommend 170 over 180 if you're looking for a less stressful semester.","r"
99200,"yes! it's a pre-med requirement so most students in the class take it for this reason, but prof demers makes it genuinely enjoyable","r"
99200,"I would recommend this course for sure. It is easy to follow the lecture, the p-sets are achievable if you work together, and the exams are accessible if you study well.","r"
99200,"of course","r"
99200,"Yes!!! Especially with Prof. Demers. She made the class my favorite STEM experience at Yale so far and compared to other physics courses made the concepts more approachable and less daunting to understand.","r"
99200,"Not unless you are pre-med or need it for your major. However, I would definitely recommend 170/171 over 180/181 because the exams are way easier","dr"
99200,"Requirement, dunno if anyone takes this for fun, but not a bad class.","neu"
99200,"Yes! Accessible, clear lectures and fair exams. Be warned that you will likely spend some long hours in office hours (but really, it's not that bad).","r"
99200,"If you want a science gut that doesn't require attendance, yes. If you want to learn physics, take PHYS 181/201/261.","neu"
99200,"Yes, if they are a pre-med student that doesnt have a strong physics background","r"
99200,"I would recommend this course to anyone that needs it.","r"
99200,"Yes","r"
99200,"Yes, I would recommend this course, especially for students interested in life science or pre-med. This course fulfills requirements that are necessary for many students.","r"
99200,"Yes!","r"
99200,"Yes, if they are interested in physics and want an approachable entrance or are premed","r"
99200,"Yes. Great for Pre-Med and MCAT.","r"
99200,"Yes I would. If students need to take physics for premed or another requirement this is a great class. It follows a good pace and there is a lot of support for students if they need.","r"
99200,"Yes! If you want a conceptual understanding rather than mathematical understanding of Physics, take this class. It was also interesting to hear the biological connections.","r"
99200,"I would recommend this course to another student especially if they are more of a conceptual learner and want to know the basics of Physics 2. I don't think this sequence is as math and calculus heavy as the 180 sequence, and I believe the workload was definitely manageable especially if you are a pre-medical student taking other pre-requisites like organic chemistry or biochemistry at the same time. I think the course is very manageable, and if you are looking for additional support and help, they are always available because the times for office hours are all throughout the week, and all of the TAs are extremely helpful.","r"
99200,"Yes if you are pre med, I'd choose 171 over 181 because the workload is much less and you are pretty much learning the same things","r"
99200,"Yes. If you are deciding between PHYS 181 and 171, take 171 if Sarah is teaching! Excellent course.","r"
99200,"Yes its taught well","r"
99200,"Yes, if Dr. Demers is teaching the course, I would recommend it to another student. She did her best to take into account our feedback, actively seeking it out, and made a lot of effort to implement it within the course. She adjusted the course from last semester, based on student feedback, and created a very well-balanced course that I enjoyed greatly!","r"
99200,"Yes, if you want some respite after the HUGE workload of PHYS 180 with Steinacker/if you are a pre-med student with a busy workload. It is fun, useful for MCAT, good for mental health class. If you want a class that provides a more rigorous introduction to physics with calculus, take 181.   I actually loved doing PHYS 180/171 as a sequence. PHYS 180/181 would have been too much work but 170/171 would feel slightly lacking for someone who likes proofs.","r"
99200,"Yes. This is a good intro physics class to take, especially if you're premed. Professor Demers is amazing and very kind","r"
99200,"Yes! This class is 10/10 and really makes physics interesting and fun! I would especially recommend this class for pre-meds or people interesting in the biological aspects of physics! For example Professor Demers connects concepts like oscillation to how they ear is able to hear vowels and optics to how corrective lenses work. This class is great and honestly made me love physics! Take itttt :D","r"
99200,"Yes! Much easier than other physics courses and it is so fun!","r"
99200,"Yes, it was a great physics class.","r"
99200,"Yes! class well structured to learn physics !","r"
99200,"Yes absolutely!","r"
99200,"I would. PHYS 170/171 has a reputation for being the easier of the 2 introductory physics classes because it is not math-heavy. However, I found that I was able to learn more physics because this class focused on more conceptual material than PHYS 180.","r"
99200,"Not unless its a requirement or you are just super duper interested in physics.","dr"
99200,"Yes. If you are considering 171 to 181, I made the switch and I believe it was a great change. The teaching team for 171 was amazing and the workload made my spring semester much more balanced. I got to enjoy physics with Professor Demers!","r"
99200,"Yes, amazing course with a great prof","r"
99200,"Yes!!!","r"
99200,"Yes, if you need physics that is more conceptual based then this is the class for you.","r"
99200,"Yeah if you want a relatively easy E&M course you should take this. I switched from 180 to 171 and it was a game-changer.","r"
99200,"Only over PHYS 181 because its easier to get a better grade in this class.","neu"
99200,"YES! Take this course if it is with Professor Demers. She is a gem. This is wayyyy better than 180 for premeds. The tests are totally fair and you have a lot of help on problem sets. There are ""weekly"" quizzes, but you get a 90% for putting your name down and it can only go up from there. They are also very basic, so you don't have to stress. And you get to drop two of them. Take this class if you are premed, or if you are interested in physics.","r"
99200,"Sure. Professor Demers is great and she really puts effort into making the material engaging and for providing support for her students. The material itself isn't the most inspiring stuff. If you don't have to take it as a pre-requisite there are probably more interesting physics classes out there. If you do, do 170 instead of 180 if possible.","r"
99200,"yes","r"
99200,"Yes, for those that need a physics credit, this course is well taught and walks you through concepts at a pretty slow pace. As someone who doesn't love physics that much, I appreciated the amount of enthusiasm Prof Demers gave and how much support there was from study halls, office hours, and TAs.","r"
99200,"I definitely would. I learned a lot, and the course did not make me stress.","r"
99200,"It is a very easy physics class. If you do not care about an in depth understanding and just want to get the basics, this is for you. However, if math and physics come more naturally for you, you may get bored with the pace of this class.","r"
99201,"This is a required course for most STEM majors. It's a tough sell to take this for fun. The class definitely teaches a lot, but there are better ways to learn this material. Many pset problems seem unnecessarily difficult and tedious compared to what is tested on exams. It will take a lot of work to gain a true appreciation for electricity and magnetism, and you won't get much from half-assing this class.","neu"
99201,"I would absolutely recommend this class to someone else! The skills you learn here are transferrable, and engagement in this class allows you to not only understand physics more but gain life-appliable tactics to succeed. (Also, the professor is so kind that meeting her is a real pleasure.)","r"
99201,"Yes, you get a lot more out of learning physics, but the psets involve a lot of calculus.","r"
99201,"With Prof. Steinacker, absolutely","r"
99201,"I would recommend this course to another student simply because of Prof Steinacker. She facilitates learning in a unique way that allows for us to become much more fluent in physics than any course I've taken.","r"
99201,"Yes. Even if it's not a requirement for you, the material is interesting and the professor is great.","r"
99201,"Absolutely, especially if Professor Steinacker is teaching it! I had a few friends who took PHYS 181 without Professor Steinacker, and from what I heard, my experience was considerably better than theirs because of Professor Steinacker. She does a great job of going through lecture at a quick pace but offering plenty of opportunities to clarify material. The workload was also a bit more manageable than PHYS 180 (due to the slightly shorter problem sets), which also made the class better than PHYS 180 I think.","r"
99201,"Absolutely would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about E&M in a challenging but incredibly supportive environment. You will learn a lot and have countless opportunities to think critically about the material while also building community with fellow students, peer tutors, and TFs who act as resources in the course.","r"
99201,"Yes this course is wonderful and Prof. Steinacker is a very rare and wonderful sort of teacher who guides you through a physics journey that is difficult but very possible for anyone","r"
99201,"Probably not if it wasnt required for their major.","dr"
99201,"I would recommend taking it. Most people need it as a major requirement, but it is well taught and resources for help are readily available.","r"
99201,"Yes, with Prof. Steinacker this course was a treat.","r"
99201,"I would 100%","r"
99201,"Yep, well taught and organized. Homeworks do take a bit of time tho","r"
99201,"No, absolutely not. For an introductory physics course, it was completely unnecessary. Prerequisite courses should never be this time consuming. Difficult, sure, but time consuming because of contrived mathematical tricks in problem sets and tests? Definitely not.","dr"
99201,"I would recommend this course to anyone interested in physics. I don't really think people coming in with advanced physics backgrounds should skip this class either. This forms a very strong foundation for future physics. That being said, people taking it only for a requirement, especially premeds, should not take this course and opt for the lower level physics course. Engineering majors have to take this course so to them I would recommend to put in the work early and try to learn the most out of it.","r"
99201,"yes. Take this over 171 if you are stuck. It is a more formal class, and you will feel better for it.","r"
99201,"If you want to learn physics, this course is for you. Great professor and good vibes.","r"
99201,"Absolutely, though I'm assuming you have to. If you are deciding between 171 and 181, take this course trust me. It is worth it for Prof. Steinacker alone. She is so passionate about this course, and you will definitely not regret taking this. You learn a lot in a pretty short amount of time, and it could be just that I disliked kinematics, but I found that this course was more interesting and applicable.","r"
99201,"No, unless you are a physics major and have taken multi variable calculus (this should be a prerequisite).","dr"
99201,"Yes, but make sure you have a good understanding of calculus beforehand!","r"
99201,"Yes, I enjoyed the problem solving process for the psets and I liked collaborating with my peers.","r"
99201,"Yes, its an important Physics class. You make friends in office hour as everyone works on them together. The material is very interesting","r"
99201,"I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Steinacker is a one-of-a-kind instructor and person; truly the finest STEM professor at Yale. Her lectures are so engaging, fun, and interesting. The sheer amount of passion and dedication she has motivates us to work harder and is honestly very, very inspiring. I am not even planning to go into STEM after college, and this has been an invaluable course for me. There is a lot of rhetoric that surrounds this class and grading. If you're asking if it's an easy A, the answer is no. But you don't take this class because it will be easy. You take it because of Professor Steinacker and to have the chance to learn from easily the best STEM professor at Yale. Physics is hard, but it is not impossible. As Professor Steinacker says: ""You can do it!""","r"
99201,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it represents a backbone in the Physics/Sciences major, developing interesting and engaging problems and discussions around fundamental, vital concepts in the field! The course developed my critical thinking and I learned skills useful in life and in many adjacent STEM fields.","r"
99201,"Yes. For most people taking it, it is required, but the amount of help and time dedicated to this course by the professor helps immensely with the difficult nature of physics.","r"
99201,"Yes, but I wonder if PHYS201 or PHYS261 might be better if youre looking to learn physics for the sake of learning rather than getting requirements done.","r"
99201,"This class is one of the best I have taken at Yale. Steinacker is unlike any other professor you can see how much she cares about teaching and the art of learning in everything that she does. I developed such a profound appreciation for math and the mechanics of physics through this course. This class is a lot of work, but I truly believe it is one of the most rewarding challenges you could take on academically at Yale.","r"
99201,"Yes if needed. I took it even though I could've taken 171 and it was still rewarding","r"
99201,"Yes!! I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Though the material can be tricky, ample support is provided to students, and the course is designed to encourage collaboration between students as they work on problem sets.","r"
99201,"I would recommend that another student take this course if they need it for their major or have any interest in learning about physics.","r"
99201,"Yes if it is a prerequisite or required for their major.","r"
99201,"No, nothing personal but this class contains more content than a general physics class should","dr"
99201,"Yes! You learn a lot in this course, and it was a really great experience!","r"
99201,"I would recommend this course to a student fully dedicated to their pursuit of physics and with some background in Electromagnetism and/or multivariable calculus. This is not a good class for someone who has never had a physics class (or never gone past AP Physics A), as there are certain assumptions made of familiarity of content. For example, I found myself just having to intuit what ""ds/dr/dt"" meant in each context because I was scared to ask outright for a while. When I finally did, the reasonings for when (and in what context) it is one versus the other, was made completely clear to me by a peer tutor and I never have felt confused by that again. However, if this had been conceptually explained at the beginning of the course (for maybe 5 minutes), it would have saved many students many hours of convoluted guessing on problem notation. I definitely felt frustrated and ""dumb"" in this course many times because of my lack of experience in electromagnetism, and seeing as even students who had taken AP Physics C struggled in the class, I'm not sure it's the best decision for those wanting to be introduced to physics in a way that doesn't scare them off. Additionally, it is hard to get by in this class if you don't have availabilities during weekday afternoons and evenings to spend hours working on the problem sets. I felt like the bulk of my real learning happened outside of class.","neu"
99201,"Absolutely! Professor Steinacker is wonderful and the class is pretty interesting. There are so many help opportunities. If you happen to be like me and wondering if you can take 181 before 180, its doable. Office hours are the best part of this class, go to them!","r"
99201,"Yes, I would. Although I sometimes find Professor Steinackers problem sets unnecessarily challenging, and the way she introduces new concepts hard to follow along, she puts in extra effort to provide support to students struggling with the material. There is plenty of peer tutor and TF support all around, and she is very accommodating when we need to request extensions on problem set deadlines.","r"
99201,"Yes!!!","r"
99201,"Yes!! So interesting, but definitely recommend taking PHYS 180 in the fall before taking 181","r"
99201,"If they have a real interest in physics and are willing to put in a large amount of work, this is a really great introductory class. I didn't know any physics coming into the sequence, but I feel it was decently beginner-friendly but still generally intellectually challenging and stimulating for students of different levels.","r"
99201,"I would recommend this course to another student, especially since Adriane curtailed her Psets from 6 problems a week to 4. This makes the workload far more manageable while still preserving the intellectual rigor of the course.","r"
99201,"Yes. Its a good course to learn intro physics.","r"
99201,"probably a req","neu"
99201,"Yes! It may be daunting to take 180/181 over 170/171, but I truly think it is worth it. I had never taken physics before in my life, so I was very hesitant to take this course, but Steinacker is a great professor and you have a lot of support to succeed in this class. I think I have actually learned more in this class than any other class I have taken at Yale. I feel like in other classes I just memorize a bunch of information and regurgitate, but 181 genuinely taught me new things and has made me a better student as a result. I am very grateful that I took this class!","r"
99201,"Yes, any class with Professor Steinacker is worth taking","r"
99201,"I would certainly recommend this course to another student if they are in the 180/181 track, or want to solidify their high school physics before moving on to more intensive subjects.","r"
99201,"I would recommend this course to another student. The course is very difficult and challenging but worth your time if you want to improve yourself as both a student as well as a future STEM Major Graduate.","r"
99201,"If they're interested in introductory physics, absolutely! There are ways to not make it heavy and bothersome so very good","r"
99201,"If its a requirement take it with Steinecker!","neu"
99201,"I would, but only if required for a major. I think that this course is difficult and can be a lot of work (PSETs each week and studying for exams) but that you can learn a lot. I think that the dedication one would have if it were to be a required course helps to justify all of the work.","neu"
99201,"Highly recommend for STEM students and those interested in the fundamentals on how the world works","r"
99201,"Yes","r"
99201,"Yes!! Professor Steinacker is one of the best instructors I've ever had. She is so dedicated and organized, and she really cares about the course and her students. The course is not easy, but there are so many office hours and study halls and resources (lectures notes and lecture videos), and you come out of it really feeling like you've learned something. If you can, go to Professor Steinacker's office hours!","r"
99201,"Only if they are truly interested in physics. I am not and would have taken the bio physics course 170 if my major allowed me to.","neu"
99201,"only if required","neu"
99201,"Yes, basic physics is necessary for most","r"
99202,"Yes! Great application of calculus and differential eqs.","r"
99202,"I would recommend any course taught by professor Steinacker to another student. I would absolutely recommend PHYS 181 to another student if they were looking to gain a thorough understanding of the basics of E&M or to satisfy a major requirement. I would not recommend students to take this course if they are looking for an easy science credit, but if they are looking to be challenged, I think this course can be extremely rewarding.","r"
99202,"yes but its not a gut or a fun exploratory course or anything","r"
99202,"Absolutely! Professor Steinacker is AMAZING, and while I may not be a physics major, she always kept my interest and explained very challenging concepts in a very clear and concise manner!","r"
99202,"Avoid at all costs and take 170/171 unless this is a major req (it unfortunately is for me), there is a far to high workload to merit recommending this course. After phys 180 many students dropped to 171 for good reason and many like myself wished they could drop.","dr"
99202,"take if you need it","neu"
99202,"Absolutely. If you're looking to better understand the physical world, this is a fantastic class. It is challenging, but there is so much support to complete the homework and understand the concepts.","r"
99202,"I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in physics. I think it is taught so well that you come out of it feeling like you have really truly learned and understood so much.","r"
99202,"If you have to, its also an ok stepping stone from 180 instead of going to 171 as you know what to expect from the professor","neu"
99202,"Yes, especially w/ Prof. Steinacker. I am pre-med so was thinking about 171 instead, but I took 181 because I liked physics and ended up enjoying the class. Be ready for long assignments and please go to Office Hours/Study Hall!","r"
99202,"Yes, if you are interested in physics or have to take it as a requirement. It does take up a lot of time.","r"
99202,"Yes. I think Steinacker is a very sweet professor, and I think that the workload was manageable. Granted, I had some physics background from taking Physics C in high school, so this course was not as challenging for me as it was for others.","r"
99202,"Yes, I would recommend this course. If you are interested in physics, engineering, or any physical science, this class helps provide foundational physics and problem-solving skills that can be applied. It will be a difficult, but rewarding class. Professor Steinacker prioritizes the learning of her students and cares deeply about your growth. So, even in the difficulty, the support is larger and the growth will be as well.","r"
99202,"Absolutely, and take it with Dr Steinacker! The physics of electric and magnetic fields is both fascinating and complex, and Dr Steinacker teaches in such a way that makes you really understand and hence enjoy the topics. There is a lot of support available in the class (peer tutors, TFs, office hours and study halls pretty much every day) to help you succeed. The content itself is interesting, and with an excellent professor who cares, it becomes that much more valuable.","r"
99202,"Yes! While this course is really hard if you dont have a physics background, you learn a lot and Professor Steinacker is AWESOME.","r"
99202,"Unless the person has this course as a major requirement, this course is incredibly difficult and presents a time commitment as well","neu"
99202,"Really, PHYS 181 is very doable after PHYS 180. The kind of problem-solving and math that you're doing in this class should be really familiar, it's just that the topics differ. P-sets are shorter than in 180 and exams struck me as slightly easier.","neu"
99202,"Absolutely","r"
99202,"Yes, this is a great choice for an intro physics sequence","r"
99202,"Yes","r"
99202,"Not really; If you are not required to take this class, but wish to establish a thorough foundation in the physics of mechanics, electricity. and magnetism, maybe. This class will take a lot of time and effort to do well and should not be taken lightly. This is not a class to take on a whim because ti just seems interesting. 1If you must take this class then be prepared for the effort it will take, but if this a non-mandatory class for you then be wary of taking it unless you truly think you van dedicate hours of time for PSETs alone, in addition to studying.","dr"
99202,"Yes! This is a great introductory physics course to learn more about this topic and also gain insights on how to solve certain problems and approach E&M from a novel perspective.","r"
99202,"Yes, Professor Steinacker is fantastic and you will have ample opportunity to learn the material. You'll take from the course what you put into it.","r"
99202,"YES! ABSOLUTELY! I love Professor Steinacker. She made learning physics so fun. If you have no reason to learn physics I probably wouldn't take this class, but if you're pre-med, an engineer, or a potential physics major, this is a great class!","r"
99202,"Yes, Steinacker is insanely passionate about physics and deeply cares for each of her students. The material is great but its only so because of the way its presented.","r"
99202,"Yes, please it take it","r"
99202,"If you're between 201 and 181, I would definitely suggest you take 181.","neu"
99202,"I would totally recommend this course because Professor Steinacker is a great teacher who understands what it takes to get students to learn, and her office hours are super helpful. I enjoy the classes a lot and she makes the information interesting and makes sure to engage the class.","r"
99202,"I would recommend it if the person needs to take a physics course. The 180 series is definitely the best option.","r"
99202,"Yes absolutely! You will learn so much and be challenged to think in new and interesting ways.","r"
99202,"I thought it was very interesting so I would recommend, but only if you're willing to put in a lot of work into the homework assignments.","r"
99202,"I would recommend this course, but only to a stem major in need of a physics credit. This course is not for someone just causally interested in the subject.","r"
99202,"Yes, the teacher is phenomenal and it's overall very interesting to learn about how the universe works.","r"
99202,"Yes, if you enjoy hardcore integrals and math applications.","r"
99202,"Yes!! Take it with Professor Steinacker if you can! Although the material moves fast and is challenging, there are enough resources if you seek them out, and the grading is very forgiving to truly encourage learning the material. The problem sets were a bit shorter this semester compared to PHYS 180, which made the workload more manageable as well!","r"
99202,"I would definitely recommend this class to other if you looking for introductory EM course to give you a solid foundation in approaching and understanding physics concepts. The professor, TAs, and peer tutors are very much supportive of the students learning.","r"
99202,"Yes, I would definitely recommend 180 and 181 because of the professor. Yes the material might be a little more challenging but you genuinely understand it and the math is kind of fun!","r"
99202,"Its a difficult class but you learn the fundamentals of physics very well.","neu"
99202,"I would recommend this course if the student is a non-physics major who still wants to get a comprehensive introductions to fundamentals of physics, but I would warn that while grading is very fair and the course has a lot of support from Professor Steinacker, TAs, and ULAs, the problem sets are very time-consuming. If you are just taking this course for a major/pre-med requirement, I have heard 170 is a lower workload, but 180 is definitely manageable especially if you are comfortable with calculus and have time to attend office hours.","r"
99202,"I would say, even though this course is at times fairly interesting, I'd only recommend it to someone who needs it for their major or is very interested in physics.","neu"
99202,"Yes. It is very important to learn physics.","r"
99202,"I would recommend this course, but I likely wouldnt recommend it for for freshman. It was very difficult, and a much larger time commitment than any other class I have taken. However, I did feel that I learned a lot and that I was trained by this class to effectively conquer other classes. After this, other classes felt easy.","r"
99202,"Yes. Especially if you do not have a background in math and physics, this course is designed to encourage success from all stem backgrounds. So much support is available, all peer tutors and TAs are excellent. Also, it is a very fun class, with physical demonstrations and the professor is phenomenal.  Go to the exam reviews! Best STEM course exam reviews at Yale so far, she brings all of the concepts together so well.  Try to take this course fall/spring (180/181) with Steinacker both semesters!","r"
99202,"Only to students who have taken 180 before and are familiar with the prof's teaching style / expectations","neu"
99202,"I would recommend this course to anyone for the camaraderie of working through really tough psets","r"
99203,"If you're going to take physics, this is a good way to do it! Probably not a good experience if you don't plan on using the knowledge for anything else though.","r"
99203,"Sure! I didn't have to take this sequence, but I'm glad I did it as the intellectual challenges were much more interesting than they would have been in a lower level physics sequence.","r"
99203,"I think it's more interesting than 180/181 and not as oppressively difficult as 200/201. For sure.","neu"
99203,"I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone with even a remote interest in physics. It doesnt require vast prior knowledge from high school physics courses it only requires that you pay attention and care about your own learning.  I do note however, that this course should be taken after physics 200 (or equivalent), because although material from the prior course does not show up explicitly in this course, you will still be required to have at least a passing understanding on how forces act on bodies, Newtons laws and other physics staples. A student without this knowledge may find themselves without the tools other students have, and playing catch-up. Similarly, this course assumes an understanding of multi-variable calculus. Although Professor Tipton does give a video primer on the topic, a student without math 120 (or equivalent) under their belt may lose points unfairly not because their physics is letting them down, but because they integrated incorrectly despite getting the physics of the problem right.","r"
99203,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think this intro physics class offers a great introduction to both classical and modern physics with a wide variety of topics and a good amount of depth in each.","r"
99203,"Yes, if you want to/need to take a physics sequence, I would really recommend. I think it is structured in the best way possible. I wish more STEM courses would follow this sequence.","r"
99203,"yes if you want to learn physics","r"
99203,"I would recommend the Physics 200/201 sequence given my experience in these classes. 180/181 usually teach the same subjects as 200/201, but have a significantly higher workload for no apparent reason. Of course, 260/261 is always an option if you're looking to challenge yourself, but 200/201 is a great middle ground. I particularly enjoyed 201; our unit on quantum mechanics was by far the most interesting part of the course. The psets for this class were not too challenging but kept you on your toes and kept us engaged and fascinated by the material. The two midterms were easy, but the final was a little rough, especially since we were tested on optics (I hate optics) and quantum mechanics.","neu"
99203,"Yes, it is much better than 260, which I took last semester. It is a great introductory physics course that is a bit challenging but not impossible to get an A in.","r"
99203,"This class never stressed me out too much, because homework is 40% of the grade and the TFs can check answers in office hours. I think I had the physics background to take 261, but even though I've seen the material before, I was rarely bored. Tipton isn't always the best lecturer -- he can get confused by his own slides sometimes, and I don't know how much more stressed I would be if I couldn't fill in some of his blanks with my own prior knowledge -- but given my background I thought the class was chill and always enjoyed the 15-minute walk to SPL to attend lecture.","neu"
99203,"If you want to learn the important topics in E&M without having to do super difficult p-sets, I would recommend this class. It covers more topics than PHYS 180 but is less challenging than PHYS 260.","r"
99203,"I would recommend this course to someone who has some physics and math background and is interested in learning about a wide variety of topics in physics.","r"
99203,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student, who is interested in physics. It is a good choice for physics majors as it is well taught and comprehensive, covering lots of content.","r"
99203,"Yes. It is a great look into electricity and magnetism, and the quantum portion is especially good!","r"
99203,"Yes! I am a huge fan of Prof Tipton's lecture style and the depth/breadth of concepts that this course covers.","r"
99203,"I would! Its one of the best classes Ive taken!","r"
99203,"I would! Especially over PHYS 261. It's way more chill, and if it's with Prof. Tipton, it won't be grueling, but it will be interesting.","r"
99203,"If you want a good introduction to university E&M, this is a great class. If your not super passionate, there are easier classes that still touch on interesting topics.","r"
99203,"I would recommend this course to any student interested in majoring in physics, or who wants a challenging course to explore physics further. If you are seeing college-level physics for the first time, it will probably be pretty tricky; I struggled as someone having already taken calculus-based colle-level electromag. It definitely helps to have seen the concepts before/understand the main concepts already, as Tipton goes more in depth and challenges you with difficult problems. This course requires some dedication and work, but it is worth it as Tipton is a very nice professor! Definitely go to office hours, it's a great way to meet friends, do problem sets, ask questions, and get to know the TFs/Peer tutors and Prof. Tipton!","r"
99203,"Yes I would! Tipton is a great professor and will give you a rigorous introduction to a variety of topics that are currently at the forefront of physics research.","r"
99203,"Most likely - it offers a great foundation for approaching more complex ideas in physics, even if the teaching is sometimes lacking.","r"
99203,"I would definitely recommend this class. I took this class for fun as a cs major interested in physics topics (not looking for a career in physics). This class goes over the fundamentals without being too difficult and it does so in a way that facilitates an understanding of the big pictures in physics. Taking this class was a great decision. I learned to see the world in a different way that when I began the course. I especially love how the course emphasizes understanding the theory rather than computation.","r"
99203,"Hell yeah","r"
99203,"Yeah definitely, especially out of the other options of intro physics sequences. I really think it was a reasonable, rigorous, and enjoyable class throughout.","r"
99203,"If a person is interested in taking the introductory physics sequence, I would recommend this course, if only for the people that you will have the pleasure of being around. Even as a non-physics major, I enjoyed being in the class and interacting with physics on a deeper level (something that you might not get with some of the other introductory physics classes).","r"
99203,"I would highly recommend this course to anyone starting out in physics at Yale who has had some experience with physics EM in high school. The class's speed assumes some level of experience with EM-type physics however if you've seen it before it is quite an interesting dive into the world of particles, electricity, magnetism, light, quantum mechanics, cosmology, and more.","r"
99203,"Yes. I was originally going to skip this class and go directly to 410 because I already took AP C in highschool. Totally worth it to stay because Tipton slowly eases you into quantum that will prepare you for future physics classes, if you're considering this for the major. Also, the tests are really predictable and always align with material in the review guides and psets.","r"
99203,"I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I took 260 in the fall, and 201 with Professor Tipton made my life so much better. There are so many office hours, and the class is at just the right level of difficulty.","r"
99203,"Yes, I would. It gives you a good foundation in physics.","r"
99203,"yes! great overview to electricity and magnetism (and their connections!) and dabbling in quantum at the end of the semester was super cool!","r"
99203,"Absolutely, as it seems the objective best of the 3 intro physics courses.","r"
99203,"Yes, unless you really think that being in 200 would bore you to the point of lunacy, it's definitely worth taking with Tipton.","r"
99203,"Because of https://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-201 , I would always take phys 201 over phys 181. I would take phys 261 over phys 201 if I took Multivariable Calculus and AP Physics C.","dr"
99215,"Quantum computing at Yale is very good, and Girvin is one of the most well-accomplished quantum physicists in the country. I would recommend.","r"
99215,"good intro to quantum","r"
99215,"If you want to learn about quantum computing, then I highly recommend this course. Through the course, you learn about the basics of quantum computing, such as qubit states, qubit gates, and basic quantum algorithms that allow you to obtain the necessary background to take a deeper dive into quantum computing and understand more about this fascinating, burgeoning field.","r"
99215,"I would certainly recommend this to a student who has taken linear algebra and is interested in math, physics, or computer science. The course is a very good entryway into the field of quantum computing and provides many of the tools needed to do research or engage further.","r"
99215,"Absolutely! It's at the intersection of so many areas, you're sure to find at least some aspects of it interesting. It's also cool to learn about a truly cutting-edge technology that's still well within what an undergrad can understand.","r"
99215,"Yes, this is a great course if you are interesting in understanding quantum computing","r"
99215,"It was a very interesting course, and I would recommend it to anyone, even if you're not doing physics.","r"
99215,"Yes, especially if you are interested in the field of quantum information at all.","r"
99215,"I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in quantum computing. Professor Girvin brings a sense of excitement and wonder to the course and its focal question of why quantum computing can be done and what makes it so special. I came in without much experience in physics, computer science, or math beyond the prerequisites and found the class challenging but rewarding.","r"
99215,"Yes, if youre interested in quantum computing, a topic that is not often taught comprehensively","r"
99215,"Yeah absolutely.","r"
99215,"I would recommend this course to another student in a heartbeat. As of right now, this is most definitely the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Girvin does an amazing job of making the material accessible and slowly building up understanding from the ground up. Exams are open note, because the most important thing is the conceptual understanding. If you are remotely interested by what you see on the syllabus, TAKE THIS COURSE.","r"
99215,"Yes, absolutely! The material is quite interesting and the workload is on the lower side, so it works well as a 5th/6th class.","r"
99215,"Yes, definitely, if you are interested in quantum computation especially, Professor Girvin is great!","r"
99215,"I would recommend this course to a student interested in quantum computing, and especially someone with an interest in information theory. The course was more mathematical than applied (there was not much implementation of quantum programs beyond some final project topics and we didn't go into how a quantum computer physically works, so I would keep that in mind.","r"
99215,"Definitely! A great introduction to quantum information science that is accessible to non-physics majors. Prof. Girvin does a great job explaining concepts and makes them easy to understand, while giving motivation to learn more and pointing out the unusual and intriguing features of quantum systems.","r"
99215,"Absolutely! It was a well taught class that gave a lot of new information. If you might be interested in quantum computing, definitely go for it.","r"
99215,"Yes, it's a great way to learn about quantum computing if you're interested in that.","r"
99215,"I would recommend this class to a student interested in quantum computing from a theoretical point of view.","r"
99219,"For non physics majors, it must be taken with Skiba.","neu"
99219,"Absolutely not if Skiba is teaching it. And I say this as a straight A intensive Physics major who has been able to overcome the difficulty of every previous STEM class here. Unless you do college level competition Physics, you will fail this class. No matter how much you study, it's impossible to do well unless this is the only class you are taking in the semester and are devoted to teaching yourself Griffiths every day. If you HAVE TO take it with Skiba, I recommend skipping lecture and just reading the textbook every day, and going through every single practice problem in it (there's hundreds). Maybe then, and just then, will you be able to do okay in this class if it gets curved.","dr"
99219,"I should start by saying that Skiba is a wonderful person--he's really funny and genuinely kind, and was very entertaining in lectures! With that said, I would hesitate to take 430 with him if it's offered again. For starters, there was an enormous amount of content to be covered in the class, and we went through it so quickly and with so little practice that it often just felt impossible to fully learn everything. Secondly, the midterm and final were disastrous for our class; despite Skiba seemingly believing that they were easy tests, the overall performance of our class was possibly the worst out of every upper level STEM class I've been in. I think the problem was that Skiba failed to see that we were not understanding the content in the way that he thought we were, and he routinely seemed to simply not tell us what we were learning in lecture and make mistakes in very important derivations that were not fixed during lecture. Efforts were made with the TAs to address this, but nothing really happened. Myself and everyone I know essentially taught ourselves the course content out of the textbook (Griffiths) and gained all of our understanding that way. If taught by a different professor, or maybe if the final was not so completely out of the ballpark of everything we'd seen on our psets, I could imagine 430 being super engaging and fun--the content is really interesting if you like E&M. However, it just felt insurmountable with Skiba, which is really unfortunate.","dr"
99219,"I would not recommend this course to another student. Prof Skiba is a great person, but his teaching of the material is unclear and often seems aimless. He doesn't tell us why we're doing the calculations we're doing on the board, and most of the time many of us leave class both a) more confused than when we first arrived and b) having gained no useful knowledge whatsoever. I now realized that it would've been better if I didn't go to class and just read the textbook instead. Problem sets were fine, though there were a few that had me staying up until the wee hours of the morning and walking up science hill to turn it in, printed, in person, to the SPL mailroom (horrifying experience). I will say that the midterm was fair---I thought it was a fair evaluation and consolidation of the information that we'd learned so far. The problems were clever and interesting. However, the final was, honestly, borderline cruel. Literally incomprehensible. None of the problems matched anything that we had ever done in class, on the homework, or in the textbook. I had never studied so hard (I'm talking upwards of 40 hours) for an exam that I could not solve a single problem on.","dr"
99219,"The course essentially goes through all twelve chapters of Griffith's textbook in a single semester. This is extremely fast. I often felt lost in class and only learned concepts for the first time doing the homework (which I would often stay up 'til 3am completing). Griffiths is a fantastic book, but I did not have the ability to follow it at the pace we went. If you want to learn electrodynamics, and are used to self-studying from textbooks, just read through the book on your own. Budget a year for it.","dr"
99219,"Only if it is required (or you are a math major)","neu"
99219,"No, absolutely not if Prof Skiba is teaching it. He's a very kind person and makes the best jokes in class, but he's not a good teacher. His teaching style is to purely show derivation after derivation of complex math on the board without any associated physical explanations, which makes everyone feel completely lost in lecture. The problem sets are really difficult and the TAs don't have solution sets so they just have to spend hours and hours solving the problems themselves, and then explaining those solutions to us because the problems are too hard for them to be able to lead us to the answer without just giving it to us. The exams were ridiculously, ridiculously hard, especially the final, which was entirely impossible and way beyond the scope of the course -- we had never seen any problems like the ones on the final before, not in lecture, not in the problem sets, and not even in the entirety of the Griffiths textbook (which is a necessary read if you want to pass the class). Even after we asked for a different teaching format in lecture and even after the midterm scores were outrageously low, he never changed the way he was teaching. We spoke to the TAs about it too and nothing changed. The TAs were a godsend, but not enough to salvage the class. This class made a lot of us reconsider our love of physics and some people have switched out of the major because of it. It's made me feel really discouraged about my knowledge of and appreciation of physics, and definitely given me a lot of imposter syndrome in the field. If you're an intensive physics major and have to take this class to graduate, I'm sorry. If you have a choice to wait another year to take it with a different professor or don't have to take the class at all, please don't take it.","dr"
99219,"Yes, take this class! It may feel like a repeat of PHYS 261 at first, but you will definitely learn much more and in more depth.","r"
99219,"Yes, we learned a lot and Skiba is an excellent professor.","r"
99219,"Yes, especially with Professor Skiba. He's so nice, very funny, and a great teacher. I'm not a physics major and I just shopped this course after taking 410 on the off chance that it would be good... and I'm so glad I did!","r"
99219,"I would recommend this course to any physics student.","r"
99219,"This class is workable if you have a good group to work on psets with and if youve already seen E&M before at a high level. Otherwise, Id be cautious in taking this class.","neu"
99219,"Yes, if they are up for the rigor","r"
99219,"Probably, if the student is majoring in physics or similar, and the course is taught by Professor Skiba. The lectures were generally engaging, the PSETs weren't too difficult, and I learned a lot about electricity and magnetism, as well as a few new math tricks for solving physics problems. I also picked up some intuition for what various equations should look like (e.g. something radiating outward in space probably decreases with 1/r^2).","neu"
99219,"I would not recommend this course if Professor Skiba is teaching it. This course is a requirement for the Physics major (and many Astrophysics majors also take it), so you can't avoid taking it all together, but if you have the chance to postpone taking it when Professor Skiba is teaching I would definitely recommend doing so. Professor Skiba tried to cover way too much content throughout the course of this class. He would sometimes launch into a complicated derivation of a concept during lecture without telling us the broad-picture implications of what he was doing, get lost in the weeds of the math, come up with an answer that was often incorrect after saying its ""trivial"" and ""morally correct"" and still not inform us about the significance of the material he tried to teach us. This had a negative impact on my learning in the course, as I was never quite sure how to connect the concepts covered in lecture and I couldn't get a grasp of the bigger picture of what we were trying to learn. Professor Skiba never made adjustments to the course despite the average on our midterm being a 57%, and in the end, we took a final that had little to no resemblance to any of the problem set questions or examples covered in class even after being told by Professor Skiba that they would match. Our head TA even told us he would be able to start one of the problems on our final. As such, I do not recommend taking this class with Professor Skiba.","dr"
99219,"I would not recommend this class. It was nice that we followed the Griffiths textbook closely, but even if you do well on the homework, there is a good chance you will earn less than a 50 percent on the exams.","dr"
99219,"No, unless its for their major or their department is incompetent and cancelled the required course for their major forcing the seniors to take this class instead in order to graduate","dr"
99219,"If you like E/M, then sure, because you'll strengthen a lot of knowledge and add on to it. I guess if you're a physics major, you sort of have to take it. If you're a math major that's trying to get a requirement out of the way, though, maybe just do 410 and 440 (or maybe I just dislike E/M).","neu"
99219,"Yes. this is an important course for anyone interested in physics, engineering, math, or any related fields.","r"
99219,"Yes, if you want to learn E&M.","r"
99219,"Absolutely not; under no circumstances would I recommend this course. If it's not required, there's no reason to put yourself through this torture. This class is a complete time sink; I easily spent upwards of 20 hours a week between lecture, office hours, and the weekly pset.  You won't learn anything from the class; you might as well just read the textbook on your own or watch YouTube videos to learn E&M if you're really interested in this topic. The lectures move too quickly for you to understand anything, so you might as well learn on your own so you can control the pace of learning.","dr"
99219,"Had to take as an ABET EE. Incredibly challenging and not that rewarding, but I do feel like I accomplished something getting through. Honestly a boot camp in vector calculus if anything. Only take it if you have to or if you really love difficult physics and math (you must be able to handle both)","neu"
99219,"I would recommend this course to other students only if they are well versed in the common solution/analysis methods and problem setups utilized in Physics. If you are a non-physics major (for example, EE) fight as hard as you can to never take this course.","neu"
99219,"It largely depends on who is teaching this course. For the most part though, I would personally recommend PHYS 401/402 instead, as I feel like there was simply too much content being covered in this one semester course.","neu"
99219,"I would recommend this course to someone explicitly interested in electrodynamics. The topics covered provide a solid basic understanding of electrodynamics and some basic problem solving techniques.","r"
99219,"If you know you really want to do physics, then sure. If you are a bit iffy, I would probably say look at the textbook beforehand and see if you are into it. If you have some hesitation, probably take 402.","neu"
99224,"Sure as its a great introduction to the many factors that impact our world and contemporary history of diplomacy.","r"
99224,"I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in History or IR. Especially military-related history, as it was largely covered within the course.","r"
99224,"yes","r"
99224,"I would highly recommend this course to any Yale student. It provides a very helpful understanding of our world as political scientists see it, allowing you to better understand the goings on in the news. It is a helpful course for any student, because a proper understanding of the way our world interacts with itself can give every concentration a new spin and look at their own work.","r"
99224,"Yes i would recommend this class to those interested in real world events/ problems and history","r"
99224,"Yes","r"
99224,"No. Didnt like how the class was structured nor did I think I learned anything meaningful","dr"
99224,"Yes I would.","r"
99224,"YES! An interesting and relatively easy intro course; good for the plsc intro course requirement or to get a social science credit out of the way.","r"
99224,"N/a","neu"
99224,"I would recommend this course. Even though it had some logistical issues, the content of the class was very interesting and I enjoyed attending class.","r"
99224,"I would emphasis that it is designed for a particular type student f","neu"
99224,"Yes because this course teaches valuable knowledge and enhances the way one thinks of the world.","r"
99224,"Yes - if you are at all interested in International Relations, I would recommend taking this course. It gives you a solid understanding of the history that has shaped IR and the core ideas that make up its study.","r"
99224,"Yes. I think the course provided a good overview of the field of international relations and a helpful introduction to the practice of being a social scientist as well. Professor Allison's also a funny, interesting lecturer and the course is definitely designed to be accommodating of newcomers to the field and low stress.","r"
99224,"Yes I would. Would just give them a preface warning.","r"
99224,"Absolutely, I think every student should take this class so that they know the world we live in and have a basic understanding of human governmental history.","r"
99224,"Some students may find that they aren't particularly interested in the topics of focus such as world wars, nuclear politics, etc. This is no one's fault, but it is something to have in mind before selecting the course. For students who do find themselves interested in the politics of the world, this course is easily the best one for learning a bit about all the major global issues and finding out which one you may want to focus on learning about. It serves the function of an introductory course perfectly. This course is also very fun to be in. The 50-minute lectures by David Allison leave you feeling more knowledgeable without feeling tired or overwhelmed.","neu"
99224,"Yes.","r"
99224,"Yes! I genuinely loved this course and Prof. Allison is an amazing lecturer. I frequently left the lecture hall wanting to discuss content and questions Prof. Allison had posed us. I found this class to be extremely engaging because of --- rather than in spite of --- it's lecture format.","r"
99224,"Yale students interested in how military history and strategy should absolutely take this course. For students seeking a more comprehensive look at world history and the cooperation of international relations, this is not the course.","neu"
99224,"I would definitely recommend this course because it was engaging, applicable, and overall interesting. Professor Allison was a great lecture giver, and the content that we learned about was very interesting because it can be seen in the world today and also has a healthy amount of history associated with it so it expands both modern and historical knowledge.","r"
99224,"Perhaps if you need a gut or it's a requirement. You learn some IR theory, but the assignments do not match with the subject of the class. You could probably just read the syllabus readings and learn what you need. Take this class if you are okay with doing a major assignment during spring break.","neu"
99224,"Yes. Course was very interesting","r"
99224,"Absolutely, it is not very demanding but teaches many important facts.","r"
99224,"Yes, great course, thoroughly enjoyed the lecture","r"
99224,"Yes. Important course to take in a very important field!","r"
99224,"Absolutely! Fantastic pick for a poly sci course that explains theory, history, and present day.","r"
99224,"Yes, if theyre interested in international relations","r"
99224,"Not necessarily not very interesting and the coursework does not go very in depth","dr"
99224,"I would. Anyone interested in foreign policy or world history (particularly military history or the history of international relations) should take this class. I thought it was informative, engaging, and provided a good framework for analysis.","r"
99224,"Yes, I would. It's a great class that is both relevant to the times as well as teaches theory.","r"
99224,"yep, its good","r"
99224,"Yes, most definitely. The class is not all about just history or current issues; it teaches you the importance of learning all different perspectives so even if it isnt a major requirement, its a good course to take.","r"
99224,"If they are trying to determine whether they might be interested in the field of international relations, then yes.","r"
99224,"Definitely. This is crucial information to anyone who is interested in politics or wants to understand how the world works","r"
99224,"I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about the ways in which states interact, but especially if they are interested in pursuing political science or global affairs and wish to learn more about those fields. This course really provided me with a strong foundational framework with which I could view the world of international relations, and it has informed both the ways that I analyze interactions between states and my approach in forming my own opinions about current international affairs.","r"
99224,"I would recommend this course to another student, especially if it is a major requirement. The course has a very organized structure and I enjoyed gaining experience conducting mini political science experiments.","r"
99224,"Yes, I enjoyed this course and would recommend it to a student who wanted to learn a basis for international relations and a foundation for overall political science.","r"
99224,"I would recommend this course. It is an interesting introduction to political science and a good survey course for those interested in international affairs.","r"
99224,"I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in IR especially for anyone interested in conflict and its implications on international stage.","r"
99224,"Yes! I highly recommend this class to any student interested in global affairs or political science. It is a great introduction to a complex school of study and the topics we learned are very interesting and relevant to the modern world. I am now able to look at news articles and pinpoint/understand the undercurrent ideological and political forces at play.","r"
99224,"100 %.","r"
99269,"I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about the Constitution.","r"
99269,"Yes- easily the best course I've taken at Yale, Amar is an amazing professor. All the TFs are brilliant and super helpful as well. Even if you don't have a profound interest in constitutional law, this course is a must to be able to understand our political system.","r"
99269,"100%, it is a lot of work and hard to get a great grade without putting all of yourself in the course, but I think it is a must take for any Yale student. A very reasonable Credit-D-Fail.","r"
99269,"If you are interested in constitutional law, you should take this class. I would recommend this class to a student who is self motivated to do the readings and go to section. Going to lecture will not give you much and will leave you cramming for the midterm and final. But if you go to section every week and try to stay on top of briefing the cases you're learning about, you'll be fine!","r"
99269,"I took this class Credit/D/Fail my senior spring, which I intended from when I started the course. Taking it in this manner definitely made the material more approachable. I do think that if a student wants to take it for a grade, they should expect to invest a significant amount of time studying for assessments and reading material. That being said, I do think that it was worthwhile.","neu"
99269,"If you are interested in law, this is a great class to take. Professor Amar is a spirited lecturer, and there are a lot of students who take the class to try and cozy up to him with the idea that he will get them into law school. This does not have to be you. Even if you disagree with some of Professor Amar's stances, the TFs do an amazing job of teaching the material in a really thorough and neutral manner, and you don't have to agree with him! Learning why you disagree with someone can be just as educational as learning why you agree with them. If you do take this course, absolutely do section (it is optional). I don't know how anyone understands any of the material without going to section.","r"
99269,"Yes, if you're interested in the Constitution at all!","r"
99269,"yes","r"
99269,"I'm a huge fan of this course. It gives you a reason to develop a close relationship with a student TA from the best law school in the world, and you even get to make a well informed choice on who your TA will be. Hell, you can even have multiple TAs and they'll all give you valuable insight on ConLaw, law school, and consequential topics in our world today.   I know the main complaints about this class are that ""Amar only teaches his view"". All teachers do this but only Amar is up front about it. Besides, if you want another perspective on ConLaw you have 8+ TA's who would be happy to talk. In my experience, most of the people who have a negative view on this class are know-it-alls who think their you-know-what doesn't stink. If you're so smart that you think your view is better than Amar's, that's totally fine because he's not even the one grading you.   Throw yourself into this class and be prepared to adjust for what you enjoy learning. You might like lectures more or certain TA sessions. You might like short exams or longer ones. This course offers all options and I guarantee it will be rewarding if you explore those options.","r"
99269,"Yes, please please take this course if you have an interest in constitutional law. If you don't know anything about the Constitution, I would say that this class might be challenging for you. However, for those interested this class is a must. It starts off a little slow but really picks after spring break and becomes super interesting. These days, Amar is THE con law guy and to be able to learn from him about how to make a constitutional argument was invaluable. This class could be frustrating at times and there was a lot of reading and Amar's lectures didn't always get to everything. But, in hindsight, this was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. If you get frustrated with it just know that is normal and to keeping going anyway!","r"
99269,"I would but go in with a plan to either Cr/D/F or figure out how to slice up the readings so you're staying engaged but not drowning.","r"
99269,"Yes, absolutely. Though it's such a well-known class that I don't know if it needs my recommendation. Nevertheless, I had a truly outstanding experience.","r"
99269,"I think this is a really good course and it is really engaging, but keep in mind that there is a lot of reading and the exams are graded quite harshly. A good credit/d class though!","r"
99269,"I'll recommend this course to those who want to experience law school study being an undergrad.","r"
99269,"If you are interested in con law, absolutely. If reading and writing are not your strong suit I would not recommend taking this for credit; there is a lot of reading involved.","r"
99269,"Yes. It was very interesting, ESPECIALLY if you take it with discussion section","r"
99269,"I would recommend the course to a student if they are very motivated and excited about constitutional law. I think this motivation is key to working through the incredible about of time it takes to understand the lectures and readings.","r"
99269,"Yes: if students want an interesting social science credit to remember, this is a great course","r"
99269,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is doing anything in the public sector. You will not only learn about Constitutional Law, but also how law itself is practiced. And you will learn about the fundamental structure of our government.","r"
99269,"Yes. All Americans should have an understanding of the Constitution. I thought I did before taking this course but quickly realized how many misconceptions I had.","r"
99269,"yes, under the condition that they prioritize preparation for section over that for lecture","r"
99269,"Absolutely - best course I took at Yale!","r"
99269,"Yes. The content is great, the topic is important. Amars lectures can be very difficult to follow but if you go in knowing that youll have to learn the content from readings and section youll be fine","r"
99269,"I would recommend this class to anyone interested in politics, government or law.","r"
99269,"Yes! Great introduction to constitutional law and good indicator of whether or not you might like law school. Don't take this first year though or if you are going to, not with 5.5 credits. There is a lot of reading and to get the most out of the course, you're going to want to do it. So take it with a courseload of 4-4.5 credits.","r"
99269,"Yes! This is a classic Yale course for a reason. Professor Amar is extremely dedicated to the class and its students. While lecture can be a bit confusing at times, sections &TAs are fantastic and help clear anything up. It is not an easy class, but is manageable if you put in lots of effort.","r"
99269,"Yes, great Professor and content","r"
99269,"No, I would not recommend this course to another student even if you are prelaw. You can read Amar's books, listen to his talks and podcasts online anytime you want. You will little if anything from taking this course, unfortunately.","dr"
99269,"I would absolutely recommend this course. It is probably my favorite that I have taken at Yale. Absolutely loved it. SUch an interesting course and it is a great opportunity to take a class with a Sterling professor.","r"
99269,"Yes! Akhil Amar is a wonderful lecturer on examining Constitutional law cases through a historical lens, clearly loves the subject, and takes the time to get to know his undergraduate students through his lunches after every class. If you spend the time to take this course, it will make your semester!","r"
99274,"Yes, the content is very interesting","r"
99274,"yes, especially if you're interested in law and the healthcare system","r"
99274,"YES!! Low workload, great professor, extremely interesting content. I definitely see the things I learned helping me in my day to day life.","r"
99274,"Yes! This is a great course for anyone interested in health, in law, or in health law. I thought there was a good mix of pre-meds, pre-laws, and just people interested in the course, and this variety made the discussions more fruitful. The course grade is made up entirely of tests, and the test are very fair, so if you pay attention and go to class, you should do well in this class.","r"
99274,"Yes. Super fucking interesting and forced me to question a lot of stuff and also learned a lot of stuff about things I thought I knew.","r"
99274,"YES!!! take this class -- great 5th class and very worthwhile","r"
99274,"Yes","r"
99274,"Yes. It is a super interesting course but be prepared to really study for the three exams because they make or break your grade","r"
99274,"Yes, it has changed my view on certain issues and events for the better.","r"
99274,"I would, just be prepared to memorize. If you don't have the space for it, just get a study guide from someone and read it on your own time.","r"
99274,"Yes, I learned things that are very applicable to my life and learned how to think critically on bioethics issues.","r"
99274,"I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Professor Latham is one of the best lecturers I have had at Yale--engaging, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable about the course material. The subject material is also super timely and interesting.","r"
99274,"Yes!! Super engaging for a non bio non polisci student","r"
99274,"I would highly recommend this course to another student interested in bioethics and important issues affecting society.","r"
99274,"YES! Such a good class to take as a second-semester senior.","r"
99274,"Definitely, Latham is a great lecturer","r"
99274,"Absolutely, both for students with prior experience in this field of study and for those from other disciplines.","r"
99274,"Yes, definitely one of the best college classes to take at Yale!","r"
99274,"Yes, especially in the political science field, a lot of the topics were unique and engaging.","r"
99274,"yes, super interesting and learned a lot","r"
99274,"Yes! Professor Latham is a great lecturer and the content is really interesting.","r"
99274,"Yes! A must take at Yale!","r"
99274,"100% even if you're not a politic major, you get so much out of it. Important to understand how public health and healthcare works.","r"
99274,"Yes, very interesting material and exams are easy as long as you go to class. TA's are also very helpful, but this course is very TA dependent.","r"
99274,"yes! incredibly interesting especially in regards to more contemporary issues like Dobbs and Covid","r"
99274,"Best course Ive taken at Yale so far. Professor Latham is fun and an absolute expertthe course is also not too challenging or too much work, and could be a great fifth class. Highly, highly recommend.","r"
99274,"Yes. Fascinating overview of the legal landscape of modern bioethical issues. Low workload & generously graded.","r"
99274,"I would recommend.","r"
99274,"Yes!! Excellent intro course that is interesting for matters concerning law and science.","r"
99274,"Overall, yesthis was one of my favorite classes this semester, primarily due to the very interesting subject material. Just keep in mind that this class is not necessarily as much of a ""guaranteed A"" as other reviews make it out to be. Grading is often incredibly arbitrarymost TA's grade exams like a checklist, so if you don't mention one of the cases they were looking for, your grade will go down. Grading also can vary pretty dramatically between sections. Overall, though, the class is pretty low workload (you can do well just by showing up to lectures/sections) and the material is very interesting, so I'd recommend the class on that basis alone.","neu"
99274,"Yes, Professor Latham is an engaging lecturer, the workload of this is course is very manageable, and the content is very interesting. It was a great course!","r"
99274,"10000%! This was my favourite course at Yale and I could not recommend it more. The lectures were engaging, the readings so interesting and the knowledge you gain is so applicable to your daily personal life and for general knowledge! Its also a great introduction to law and justice!! Take this class!!!","r"
99274,"Definitely. I think if you are at all interested in medicine, ethics, etc, then you will find this course very interesting. Lecture and discussion are both enjoyable, and you will learn a lot!","r"
99274,"Yes, 100%. Not much work, GREAT professor who is incredibly intellectually engaging, and exams thats are very fair.","r"
99274,"Yes, especially if you're not necessarily studying something related to this field. The content is so important to know and Professor Latham makes it easy to approach and understand.","r"
99274,"Yes! You learn about lots of really cool and interesting bioethics issues.","r"
99274,"Yes, the content is so interesting and Professor Latham is my favorite professor at Yale. You learn so much about bioethics and a lot of it is super new with Dobbs and covid mandates. Definitely take this class if you can.","r"
99274,"Yes, if you are interested in a survey course on bioethics.","r"
99274,"Yes - one of the few classes I've taken where the workload is low, but the material is interesting.","r"
99274,"Absolutely. Probably my favorite class at Yale.","r"
99274,"I would highly recommend this course to another student because the class was very exciting. I gained a better understanding of the world around me, especially when it comes to bioethics issues, so I would highly recommend this course to another student.","r"
99274,"Yes! I think it's just really important to learn and be aware of all the issues discussed throughout the course. It really is eye-opening to know more about legal decision-making as well as what medical rights we have, especially as we leave Yale.","r"
99274,"Yes! So interesting. The professor is really knowledgeable and the TAs were great. Its not much work besides the 3 exams which are essay questions. I enjoyed the material a lot and studying for the exam was interesting. Even as a psychology major I really liked this class","r"
99274,"YES YES YES YES. Please take this course no matter what you want to major in. It is so interesting and you learn things that will stick in your mind for year to come.","r"
99274,"Absolutely","r"
99274,"Yes, take this course if you can!","r"
99274,"Yes! The course is very interesting and the teaching team is very supportive. PLSC 257 teaches you how to think about bioethical problems and what the current laws about these issues are, which is important to everyone because all people receive medical care, but especially so for people in medicine and law.","r"
99274,"Yes, especially for students who want to engage with the law or want a more generalized approach to understanding our current legal framework and how biomedical technologies have paved the way and altered the meaning of certain laws. Very easy to understand the material and was interesting enough that I actually enjoyed reading the textbook readings.","r"
99274,"Yes! It doesn't have a very high workload but it's still super interesting and will make you think a lot about bioethics and healthcare. The topics and lectures are very interesting and I found myself discussing what I learned with friends. Great class for people looking for a Social Science credit or for Political Science majors looking for a lecture class in American Government.","r"
99274,"Yes definitely. Every kind of student has something to gain by listening to Professor Latham talk about the topics in his field. Super interesting stuff and would definitely recommend, especially to stem people.","r"
99274,"yes! i learned so much whether or not you are interested in law this course would be amazin","r"
99274,"Definitely","r"
99274,"Yes, this course is great for any student to take. It really lives up to its reputation as one of the best courses in the school.","r"
99274,"Yes!! Very interesting course esp if you like memorizing court cases","r"
99274,"Yes because it was not overly taxing and I really enjoyed learning and attending class as a whole.","r"
99274,"Yes!! This is such an important course to take for any major to understand the landscape of American healthcare and different bioethics issues that are pressing and important to know. It was well organized with weekly reading responses that kept you accountable to learn the material as the course went on rather than cramming right before exams. The TFs were very helpful and organized review sessions that were productive and helped synthesize the material well.","r"
99274,"Absolutely! Great understanding of the American health system and legal/ethical questions that continue to dominate our discourse today. Very happy I took PLSC 257!","r"
99274,"Yes, enjoyed going to class for this course.","r"
99274,"Yes, I would! I love the lecture format of this course and Professor Latham is a very engaging lecturer.","r"
99274,"Yes, whether you are pre-med, pre-law, or anything else, I think this course is fascinating.","r"
99274,"Yes! It's a great way to learn about some fascinating stuff without destroying yourself in the process. My TA was also FIRE, and I think that impacts people's experience of the class quite a lot.","r"
99274,"I would recommend this course because it is interesting, well-taught, and helpful for those who may want a career in law or healthcare.","r"
99274,"Yes, great if you are interested in medicine and law.","r"
99274,"I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer and knows how to keep students engaged with the material. I also appreciated how a lot of the topics were connected and he updated the course material with recent cases.","r"
99274,"Yes definitely, the course was very enjoyable and I learned a lot!","r"
99274,"Absolutely, one hundred percent, this is one of my favorite classes at Yale. It does a really good job of giving comprehensive consideration to many bioethical and legal questions and consistently inspired me to pursue some kind of hybrid career in medicine and law. It really. pushed me to think in new ways about issues that are so close and intimate to people's lives and I think it's an excellent class to take regardless of what you're thinking about doing.","r"
99274,"Yes. Although it is not technically a gut, you just have to go to lecture and take the 2 midterms and the final. The bioethics topics are also very interesting tot learn about, and Professor Latham is a great lecturer.","r"
99274,"Yes! My favorite class I've taken so far.","r"
99274,"Yes I would","r"
99274,"I absolutely would! It was really interesting and I thought it was very well taught. Learned a lot.","r"
99274,"Yes! It's super interesting and not a lot of work","r"
99274,"Yes it is a great class and interesting","r"
99274,"Yes absolutely Dr Latham is an amazing professor and the TFs are amazing","r"
99274,"Yes! Very interesting especially if you are not pre-med and are just taking it out of genuine curiosity.","r"
99274,"Yes yes yes!! It was an incredible course and you learn so much without having to do excessive assignments. Its not a gut, but its incredibly doable and rewarding. If you are a prospective doctor or lawyer its a great coarse to have to build up your knowledge.","r"
99274,"Yes. The course is enriching for both students interested in entering the medical field and those interested in practicing law. Beyond that, Professor Latham is an incredible instructor and I would strongly encourage students to take a class with him, whether it's this one or another one.","r"
99274,"Absolutely, Latham is one of the best professors and the class is so interesting.","r"
99274,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING THIS COURSE! The workload isnt bad, and the grading isnt harsh. Moreover, the content is super interesting and provides a solid introduction to the law for any pre-law students out there.","r"
99274,"Yes, a really good introduction to interesting topics ... makes you think critically more than most introductory classes.","r"
99274,"Yes, interesting material and format","r"
99274,"yes one of my favorite classes in terms of content and teaching","r"
99274,"Absolutely. Great course for understanding the legislative and social aspects of health care, public health and biotechnology, their role in our lives, and the way in which it is going to be evolving.","r"
99274,"Yes, I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of their focus of study. The issues discussed in this class are not just pertinent to the medical or legal fields, but also are deeply important social issues that everyone should be informed on. Latham presents a clear, concise representation of the facts, allowing for students to form their own opinions regarding the issues discussed.","r"
99274,"Yes, this has been one of my favorite courses I have taken so far, as it is both interesting and engaging.","r"
99274,"YES","r"
99274,"I would recommend the course to other students since it doesnt require any prior knowledge of politics or law and can be interesting for anyone.","r"
99274,"Yes! This a class every Yalie should take. Not only does it have practical value, it also is very interesting and informative.","r"
99274,"Yes, especially if you are interested in health law","r"
99329,"Yes; it provides a good introduction to psychology in an interesting way. The lectures are well organized and the slides are helpful. If you show up to class and pay attention, you can do well on the exams with minimal studying.","r"
99329,"Only if you're good at memorization -- I am not and it was pretty frustrating since the writing assignments barely carried any weight. I thought I understood concepts well, and found the tests pretty confusing.","neu"
99329,"Yes, but only if they are interested in psychology","r"
99329,"This class was your basic introductory Psychology class. I appreciated how enthusiastic the professor was and how she put the main points we had to grasp at the end of each lecture on a slide. However, I felt like the teaching fellows were not the best at providing feedback; they often docked points for citation errors (?) and such without fully explaining why. Feedback on exams was also non-existent, making it difficult to know where to improve. You got the grade but you are never told what you missed explicitly. The good thing about this class is that all of the exams were non-cumulative.","neu"
99329,"Yes! This was the course that made me realize I would probably major in psychology or something related. I consistently showed up to this class even though the slides were absolutely clear enough for a sick person to walk themselves through the material.","r"
99329,"Yes it's an interesting course that gives you a lot of basic understanding of psychology","r"
99329,"I would recommend this course to another student with the stipulation that the work load is a lot higher than other courses I've taken so far.","r"
99329,"Yes, it is a fun course but a lot of work","r"
99329,"It is an amazing class. Made me want to major in Psychology and take more classes in it. This is a must take while at Yale","r"
99329,"Yes. good knowledge to know. Helpful if you're pre med for the MCAT","r"
99329,"Hard to get high grades","neu"
99329,"No, not unless they were considering psychology as a major. It's just not as interesting as most of the other courses I have taken at Yale, since it is an introductory course that pretty much just gives a broad overview.","dr"
99329,"Yes. If you're looking for an interesting course to broaden your schedule (and a class that isn't such high workload), this is a great option. It covers a wide variety of topics, all of which are super interesting even if you have zero psychology experience and zero interest in becoming a psychology major. Professor Lazzaro is also an incredible lecturer, maybe the best I've ever hadso if you have the opportunity to take this class with her, you should. The workload isn't zerothere are multiple essays/5-page research papers throughout the semester, in addition to three midterms that you will have to study for if you want to do well. However, for an interesting class with a manageable workload, this is a great option.","r"
99329,"I would recommend this course to a student looking for a low-stress social science credit. I would not consider this course a gut, but if you put in enough time to learn the concepts, you will most likely be guaranteed a good grade. Professor Lazzaro's lectures are quite engaging and the topics are fun, since she simply just chooses whichever ones are most interesting to her. In this way, you won't be following a traditional textbook-style lecture. You will have to attend lecture because they aren't recorded, but the content is pretty interesting, in my opinion.","r"
99329,"I would recommend this course only to people who have to take it for their major. It is an incredibly boring course, and I do not recommend this class as a social science credit because it is boring and fully dependent on your TA.","r"
99329,"I took this course because I need it for pre-med requirements, and I'm sure that's the reason a lot of other students were in there as well. If you need this course for your major or pre-med, sure. It's a great course that teaches fun information and is not very difficult workload or exam wise. However, if you are interested in psychology or want something beyond a broad scope of information, take a higher level psych class.","r"
99329,"Yes, very good lecturer and interesting information","r"
99329,"Kind of a social science gut if you are willing to cram a little bit before exams and go to class (the slides arent super helpful by themselves)","neu"
99329,"yes ! good intro info","r"
99329,"Yes. As described above, this course opened my eyes to human behavior, and everyday I can't help but notice the patterns and reasoning behind every action I witness as well as those I take myself. I also think that this course could potentially be an eye opener to some people struggling with mental illness and anxiety, as oftentimes they might not even realize how real their struggles truly are, and how there are real ways to overcome these problems and lead happier lives.","r"
99329,"Yes, this is a fun and helpful course!","r"
99329,"Yes, class was very interesting","r"
99329,"yes, it is a good introduction to psychology course, interesting and engaging lectures, and instructor is a good teacher","r"
99329,"Lectures are interesting but you really have to work for an A. Not a gut.","neu"
99329,"Yes this is a very fun class","r"
99329,"Yes, I think intro to psych is a class everyone should take and can benefit from. It allows you to understand yourself, the people around you, and our interactions with each other better.","r"
99329,"only if you are interested in psychology and willing to put in the work for it.  this course is LOT of work (4 papers, 3 exams) for an introductory course and the grading is NOT super easy. With that being said, the professor Lazzaro was INCREDIBLE of a lecturer (i was always so engaged in each of the lectures) and I really did learn a lot of interesting psychology principles, how to review studies, and genreal useful skills.","neu"
99329,"Yes! Good intro class. Not too difficult conceptually, but still very interesting to anyone who might want to learn a little psych.","r"
99329,"Note: if you've taken ""Intro to Cognitive Science"", I don't recommend Intro Psych. There's substantial overlap between the material.","neu"
99329,"Yes, the lectures presented really cool topics, most of which were definitely applicable to our daily lives","r"
99329,"I would. I would caution that it was more work than perhaps initially anticipated, but overall enjoyable.","r"
99329,"The course wasn't time consuming, and the lectures were awesome. With that being said, I didn't find it to be a particularly deep learning experience. Probably good information to have been exposed to though, so if you have space/ have to, go for it.","r"
99329,"No. There are other more interesting psyc classes. You only get feedback on papers and that only counts for 29% of your grade. Also, Prof. Lazzaro is mean, in my opinion.","dr"
99329,"Yes, it was a good overview of psychology concepts and allowed me to build understanding of the way our minds work.","r"
99329,"If youre unfamiliar but interested or if you want to pursue the major. If you already know quite a few ideas in psychology then this wont break much new ground.","dr"
99329,"Probably not unless you need to take it. I wanted to take this class to learn about the field of psychology and although I feel like I did a bit, I think it could have been much more engaging","dr"
99329,"Yes - it is a very good introduction in both breadth and depth.","r"
99329,"If the content sounds interesting to you, then yes! Be aware that the exams involve memorizing a lot of random facts.","r"
99329,"I would recommend this course to anyone interested in psychology. Its a great starting point.","r"
99329,"Yes if they are interested in psych","r"
99329,"Not really, take Introduction to Cognitive Science instead!","dr"
99329,"Absolutely, if they want to dabble in psych","r"
99329,"Fun and a relatively relaxed social science credit. Be prepared to put work in to do well, but it is an enjoyable class","r"
99329,"Yes! This is a wonderful course if it is required for your major, or if you are simply looking to explore diverse course offerings. It is incredibly engaging, the workload is manageable, and the payoff is immense.","r"
99329,"I would recommend if you are interested in psychology and potentially surrounding majors - this will provide good insight as to what other courses in the field may look like.","r"
99329,"I would recommend only for students who are considering a psychology major.","neu"
99329,"The lessons are extremely well structured and follow a logical ordering. The teacher seems very engaged in the subject as well.","r"
99329,"Yes especially if Lazzaro is teaching it.","r"
99329,"Yes! Stephanie is an incredibly engaging lecturer.","r"
99329,"I would recommend this course to another student because I feel like I now have a better understanding of myself and other people.","r"
99329,"no, grading is really strict","dr"
99329,"I would but know that it is not a gut, and it'll take work to get an A","r"
99329,"I would! I thought it was very interesting and I learned a lot of worthwhile knowledge.","r"
99329,"I'd definitely recommend this course! It's a lot of fun and a really approachable intro to psychology, though there is a lot of information to remember for the exams.","r"
99329,"Not really, I didn't think it was that interesting. However it is a pre-req for a lot of other classes and I also have taken a few psyc classes before, so maybe I was just annoyed by the repeating of info.","dr"
99329,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The material presented in lectures was very interesting and there were too many or any super long assignments that were worth a large portion of the grade.","r"
99329,"Yes. The lectures were very interesting and I thought Professor Lazzaro was an amazing professor. This course was well structured. I felt that no lecture was ever incredibly boring. Do keep in mind that this class is NOT A GUT. You have to be careful with how you study for the three exams. They are not easy and require a careful studying plan in order to memorize all the material we are given. The essays are also time-consuming and follow a very strict grading rubric. Messing up on one assignment in the course may greatly hinder your chances of getting an A in this course.","r"
99329,"I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about the current topics in psychology and gain practice writing research reviews and research proposals.","r"
99329,"No, this class was not enjoyable.","dr"
99329,"I would recommend this course if youre looking for an introductory psychology class.","r"
99329,"I would recommend this course to every student because it helped me better understand my own behaviors and tendencies.","r"
99329,"Yes. I greatly enjoyed this class and Professor Lazzaro provided a fascinating and exciting learning environment for the class.","r"
99329,"Yes - Professor Lazzaro is amazing","r"
99329,"I would recommend this course to another student if they need it for their major or another requirement. It is well taught and the grading is fair. Be prepared to spend a good amount of time on the written assignments. I think you gain a broad understanding of many topics, but if deciding to take this or another social science credit, it might be more interesting to take a class focused more on one specific topic.","r"
99329,"You probably need to take it at some point. I recommend memorizing the slides and readings.","neu"
99329,"I would recommend this course to a student looking to truly know more about psychology, but not if they already have a heavy workload.","r"
99329,"yes if psychology is interesting to you.","r"
99329,"Yes it is very interesting material that is good to know","r"
99329,"Yes, if you are a psychology major.","r"
99329,"Yes generally but it wouldn't be the first course I'd point them toward to fill 36 credits","r"
99365,"Yes!","r"
99365,"Only if they are really interested in statistics.","neu"
99365,"I would recommend it to them only if they were confident in their ability to engage with a flipped classroom asynchronous structure.","r"
99365,"Yes great intro to stats","r"
99365,"I would really consider if the flipped classroom format (basically learning from prerecorded videos) would work for your learning style. It can be hard to stay engaged and you need a lot of self-motivation.","neu"
99365,"I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great way to learn about statistics if you have no prior experience.","r"
99365,"Yes, its great for a variety of majors and interests","r"
99365,"Yes! Its an easier QR credit and a nice way to learn some intro stats that might be helpful in other majors.","r"
99365,"Not a bad class but I would take S&ds in the fall with JDRS","dr"
99365,"Yes, its a great way to learn the basics of stats with no prior knowledge","r"
99365,"Yes! It is a very good intro course to statistics","r"
99365,"I think I would recommend it to another student but would tell them that it's really important to stay on top of the lectures and that if you're not someone who can do that then I would not recommend it.","r"
99365,"No, I would not. It was hard to adapt to the learning environment, as well as the workload and time commitment.","dr"
99365,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I had never taken a statistics class before this or learned any coding, but I was able to understand all of the course material and become comfortable using R. All of the skills I learned in this class are very applicable even though I do not plan to major in S&DS or get a S&DS certificate.","r"
99365,"This instructor is a master lecturer.","r"
99365,"Would recommend the course to students looking for a different style of approach","r"
99365,"Yes, I think it is a good intro QR course and one that is manageable for non-STEM majors.","r"
99365,"If they want a basic understanding of statistics, yes.","r"
99365,"Yes. If you need a stats background, this is a great place to start.","r"
99365,"Yes because it was a fun and fairly accessible way to learn the basics of statistics which is a useful life skill.","r"
99365,"I would! If you are hesitant about taking a math class at Yale but still want to/ want something useful I would recommend it. I think I got a lot out of it without it being overbearing.","r"
99365,"I mostly would, but I honestly may recommend a different into to stats class for a bit of a lesser workload. It was overall taught pretty clearly though and I feel I definitely walked away with more knowledge.","r"
99365,"not really . - you learn the similar concepts as you would do in 240 for a example but with more exams and therefore more exam stress. - learning style of online was really convenient when wanting to review but also made student engagement pretty low...","dr"
99365,"Absolutely. Came into this as someone knowing nothing about statistics, took it as a pre-med req, loved it, may take more stats courses in the future, interesting without having a super heavy workload or requiring prereqs/previous knowledge which is rare at Yale.","r"
99365,"Yes, it's a good introduction to statistics for those without any background knowledge in stats or coding. If you have any experience, it might be a bit elementary","r"
99365,"Yes, for a QR credit","r"
99365,"Yes, with caveats; if you are a more stem-inclined person, I would recommend taking the intensive introductory statistics instead.","r"
99365,"Yes because the content of the course is stimulating and the professor is good at teaching the material","r"
99365,"Yes definetly. It teaches you applicable and marketable statistics skills + coding in R. It is very useful irregardless of whatever you hope to pursue in the future.","r"
99365,"Probably better to take one of the stats classes which targets an area of interest to you. But I haven't taken those classes.","neu"
99365,"yes, I think everyone should know the materials taught in this course and here is a good place to learn them!","r"
99365,"If you want a basic but encompassing knowledge of statistics, then yes","r"
99365,"If you are taking this course purely for a QR credit, I would consider another class. S&DS 100 is hard; it is certainly not a gut.","dr"
99365,"yes if they want to learn statistics","r"
99365,"Yes! It was a great way to get a baseline understanding of statistics both for general life purposes and for preparation for further studies.","r"
99365,"Yes its a good intro class","r"
99365,"Yes I enjoyed it.","r"
99365,"yes! great intro stats course if you just need the requirement","r"
99365,"Yes. I would recommend this course because I developed skills in coding as well as statistics. Additionally, the class is flipped, so attending lecture in person is not required.","r"
99365,"I would recommend this course to another student. It was a comprehensive overview of statistics that touched on all the major aspects within the field while.","r"
99365,"Yes! This course is a great introduction to statistics and statistical theory. The professor teaches well, the workload is low, and there are many opportunities to succeed, with frequent office hours and help from TAs.","r"
99365,"Yes, be sure to stay on top of work","r"
99365,"if you need stats for grad school or a gutty QR, then take this course. otherwise, it isn't really that worth it -- especially if you took stats in high school","neu"
99365,"I think it was a good option to fulfill the math requirement for the bio majors, but if you really want to learn a lot, I would take a higher level class.","r"
99365,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I think it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the concepts in statistics, and the class is not too hard.","r"
99365,"Yes, if they would like an approachable QR.","r"
99365,"NO there are MANY better QRs to take if you are thinking of taking this for the credit. save yourself.","dr"
99365,"Yes, especially if you are looking to gain a very solid introduction into statistics and have never done it before.","r"
99365,"Yes, any student interested in statistics should take this course. It is digestible and there are tons of problems to do, even outside of the problem sets given. You gain an intuition of how to look at any set of data like a data scientist, and you begin to understand the power of statistics; it is very easy to stretch the truth with statistics and accidentally include biases. This course helps students learn to avoid biases.","r"
99365,"Yes, if you need to be able to analyse data in your profession/ major","r"
99365,"Yes. You are not only taught a valuable programming language you can use in the real world but you are also taught important statistics concepts in a way that makes it so you will never forget them.","r"
99365,"If you want to learn the basics of statistics, take this class. If you don't think you will be on track with the online lectures, this class will very quickly become unmanageable.","neu"
99365,"Yes","r"
99365,"Yes, not too hard of a class and the content is useful to know as general knowledge.","r"
99365,"I would if they were interesting in learning R and had never coded before.","r"
99365,"Yes; I think this was a great course that allowed students to learn some practical knowledge about a very important subject in a way that did not overwhelm an unsuspecting humanities student.","r"
99365,"Yes; learning a coding language was interesting and exciting as well as basic statistics which I know will appear to be useful later in my life","r"
99365,"I would recommend this class, because I believe it is an excellent introduction to the most important statistical tools that show themselves to be useful in multiple contexts - from data analysis, to scientific research and identifying trends in a source of information. I was happy to gain abilities in programming in R as well, which I believe is useful to students pursuing very diverse majors at Yale.","r"
99365,"Not really. It works in a pinch for a QR credit, but I was bored most of the time and just hurried through the work.","dr"
99367,"Yes. This class seems practical, useful, and overall very good for most fields.","r"
99367,"No, not if they have any background in either statistics or computer science. Most of the course can unfortunately be completed by only briefly modifying the lecture code and there is pressure to do assignments this way rather than to treat them as learning opportunities because ultimately the class is curved down.","dr"
99367,"If you already know a little bit of programming and math then this will probably the easiest course you ever take - I would reccomend it for the free credit. If you don't know programming and math, you will probably learn a lot but get screwed over by the curve - if you don't care about getting a B, then I would reccomend.","neu"
99367,"less homework","dr"
99367,"Yes, I really enjoyed learning in this class. I took this for fun and it was interesting.","r"
99367,"Yes, learn to code R really well! Stay engaged and on top of your lectures.","r"
99367,"Yes, I enjoyed the course. you need to have a friend in it with you to do well, but you probably will have a friend bc the course is 500 people","r"
99367,"No. This course is a waste of a Yale credit.","dr"
99367,"Not really to be honest with you","dr"
99367,"to learn R, yes. Also you will be ok without taking intro stats and jumping into this course provided you have some background in coding (any language)","r"
99367,"I'd recommend this course to anyone who has some previous experience in Stats. I personally didn't and I struggled halfway through the course. If I were taking fewer courses, I feel like I could have traversed it much more easily and at peace. If you have 0 stats experience, but have some time (i.e. not taking 5 classes at once), I recommend for anyone!","r"
99367,"This is a great class to learn the basics of R. It is not an incredibly fascinating class, but the skills acquired are great for a strong foundation in R.","r"
99367,"No, this course did not teach me very much new or interesting material.","dr"
99367,"Yes, good follow-up to AP stats and it teaches R from the ground up, which is super useful.","r"
99367,"Yes! Great fifth class, but also very helpful if you're interested in better understanding data science and statistics.","r"
99367,"I would recommend it to a student who wanted to practice coding and needed a flexible schedule.","r"
99367,"Yes for basic understanding of stats and data exploration and coding in R","r"
99367,"I would recommend this class to another student because of the flexibility it allows in your schedule, and also the quality of instruction you get out of the class.","r"
99367,"Not really. If you want a gut where you can fish out the answers from the TA's then go for it. I wouldn't say it helped my stats in any significant sense.","dr"
99367,"yes, very well organized class","r"
99367,"Definitely a good class for intro to R. Don't necessarily have to have a strong math or coding background to take this course. Learned a lot about statistical analysis, will be useful and a good intro course if taking more S&DS courses in the future.","r"
99367,"Yes, but just know that you cannot lose a point on homework or your grade will take a hit.","r"
99367,"Yes, I would recommend this course to any who are interested in majoring in S&DS or completing the certificate. It also serves well as a second course in statistics (after an intro/AP course) for those in any field who want to gain the technical experience in R. It is a very practical and accessible course.","r"
99367,"If you're interested in not only learning more about statistics but also developing a working knowledge of R, I'd highly recommend this course. It is also one of those ""Yale course"" that you have to take if you want the full Yale experience. I'd say this course is a must for anyone who wants to delve deeper into statistical computing in the future especially transitioning into other languages such as Python. Highly recommended!","r"
99367,"If you have no (or very little) prior background in Stats, you will get nothing out of this class (it is not an easy A either, the curve is intense). If you do know stats, then maybe it does give you some basic understanding of R.","neu"
99367,"Yes if you want to learn R","r"
99367,"yes, good intro course if looking to learn R or basic data analysis skills","r"
99367,"yes!","r"
99367,"Don't take it if JDRS is teaching it.","dr"
99367,"I would recommend this course to another student looking to learn skills in R to analyze data. I think the skills I learn will be helpful in the future and I'm glad I took this class.","r"
99367,"I think this course was definitely interesting, however, if a student is looking for an easier QR credit, I would definitely say there are easier or less strenuous courses available.","r"
99367,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a very low-key way to get involved in coding in R for statistical analysis. JDRS is a wonderful, passionate professor who take a lot of care to streamline the largest course at Yale. The grading is definitely left-skewed which can make final grades a bit unclear, so beware of that. I've never taken a statistics class, nor a coding, until this, and did not have any issues. The class is a wonderful 5th or even 6th class to take!","r"
99367,"yes","r"
99367,"Yes","r"
99367,"Yes, it is a good way to learn R.","r"
99367,"Yes I think its a great introduction to R, a skill that would benefit anyone no matter the major. This language is highly useful and the class provides a one semester way to learn most of the ins and outs of rstudio.","r"
99367,"If you are interested in stats and want to get better at R, then yes, But you also have to be diligent and keep up as it can be a lot. And you should not worry about your grade, which is easier said than done","r"
99367,"I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was not life changing but I think it is a super effective and practical course and I am so glad I took it. Theres a decent amount of work, but if you keep up with it its not too bad, and JDRS is a great instructor. I think the expectations are very clearly laid out in the syllabus and the class is very true to that. If you want to learn stats and learn a bit of coding too this class is great. I took intro stats and I had a tiny bit of coding before this, which I do think were helpful. Would definitely recommend intro stats before this but you dont NEED coding experience, just need to be willing to learn. Theres some patience for trial and error needed, but again, everything is so clearly laid out in the lectures that its not the same level of trial and error and debugging that I would assume other CS classes to have.","r"
99367,"The class is decent, and you will learn a lot, but prepare to be extremely frustrated by how the class is organized. Instructions for homework and exams are frequently unclear, and trying to get answers to your questions is very difficult: a number of questions posted to Ed Discussion were just never answered, office hours were frequently canceled or moved with just a few minutes' notice (or even better, the ULAs would just not show up and not send any sort of announcement), different ULAs would give conflicting answers about project requirements, etc. I learned a lot and I'm glad I took the course, but I was also extremely frustrated throughout the semester.","neu"
99367,"Yes because it is a great introduction to R if you have never had one.","r"
99367,"Yes! I think if you enjoy any form of problem-solving or coding you will love this course. However, if that isn't something you have found yourself enjoying previously (e.g., if you would choose to write an essay over complete a p-set), this course might not be for you.","r"
99367,"Yes, a good basic intro to R!","r"
99367,"The material you learn in class is no doubt very useful. Over a semester, I went from a complete coding beginner to understanding the fundamentals of R. That said, the class can be frustrating at times not because of its difficulty but rather because of how it's structured. Cheating is rampant and the final project is peer-graded giving students the incentive to screw other people over for their own gain. Overall, it's probably worth the headache if you want the quantitative skills but I personally didn't have a good time.","neu"
99367,"If you're EPE I really suggest taking this for the pre requisite rather than an econometrics class. Also if you are interested in stats in general this tends to be a better (and slower) introduction to stats than JDRS's intro stats class from what I have heard","neu"
99367,"I would recommend this course to other students for its large amount of learning and tools available.","r"
99367,"Yes! Great way to learn to code in R","r"
99367,"If you have taken intro stats first, though it is doable without, just much more confusing","neu"
99367,"yes if you need a qr","r"
99367,"If you are interested in doing research, I think the stats and coding skills this class teaches would be really helpful!","r"
99367,"I would recommend this course to another student because you learn R. If you want to do research in STEM, R is a very useful language to know.","r"
99367,"Noyou can learn everything online with far less stress associated with your grade. Unless serious changes are made to the integrity of this course, I can't recommend it to anyone who wouldn't Credit/D/Fail it. Please do something better with your time here.","dr"
99367,"if you want to learn R","r"
99367,"Yes I would because this course teaches you how to grade in R","r"
99367,"Yes, I think it teaches a useful skill and it is asynchronous.","r"
99367,"Yes!","r"
99367,"Yes, it is not a lot of work and you learn R","r"
99367,"Yes it teaches a good sense of R programming","r"
99367,"Yes. The course is helpful to those with zero knowledge of R.","r"
99367,"If you are looking to get the S&DS certificate, then this is a fine course. Otherwise, it is very frustrating at times (as it feels like the work you put in doesn't necessarily translate to learning or good grades), and the final project grading is stressful and upsetting enough to put anybody into a coma.","neu"
99367,"If you want to learn R, yes. Otherwise I would take a dedicated stats class. With that said, JDRS was enthusiastic and engaged so that helped.","neu"
99367,"Yes, I would recommend this course when JDRS is teaching it. The exams were fair and the homework did not take too long. The only downside to this class is everyone gets a near 100 on the exams and problem sets, if you want an A in the class you need to make sure you are perfect. So most of the time it was stress about not losing points rather than learning statistics. Other than that, I felt like it was a good introduction to R and I came out knowing a lot more about statistics and R in general.","r"
99367,"I would probably recommend this course to someone either wanting to complete the stats certificate, or for those who believe they would benefit taking the class for research. Its not difficult but a very annoying class.","neu"
99367,"Yes, I think you will learn about the basics in R but it does requires some work on your own part.","r"
99367,"Yes, if they want to learn R. No, if they want to learn actual statistics.","neu"
99367,"Yes. I think its important to get this kind of quantitative exposure","r"
99367,"yes if they want to learn data analysis in R","r"
99367,"Yes! A good and easy to follow/understand statistics course that provides skills that are useful and can be used outside of class.","r"
99367,"Yes, but that it would be necessary to really make sure that your engagement with the course is high so that you understand and are able to articulate your understandings of the course.","r"
99367,"Yes I would; its a good course to improve your data analysis skills through R.","r"
99367,"Yes, if you stay on top of the assignments and are able to self motivate yourself to work hard. I truly learned so much about r this semester.","r"
99367,"Yes, it is a good course to take if you feel you need to brush up on either programming with R or need a stats review.","r"
99367,"I would because I feel that this class is taught well and its a great last credit if you are taking a heavy course load that semester.","r"
99367,"Yes, I think the applications for this class are endless and people should take it regardless of major/professional aspirations.","r"
99367,"Yes, good basic knowledge to learn","r"
99367,"Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. You learn how to use R in this course which is a very useful skill to have. The material is not overwhelmingly challenging, and the office hours are very helpful. The grade distribution turned out to be quite fair, and I really liked the professor. The final project is a lot of work, but the workload up to that point is not overwhelming. Overall, the course is a great time.","r"
99367,"Hmmm. Yes if you want to learn R basics in a chill class. You have to be okay with getting less than an A even if you have a very high grade bc of the curve.","neu"
99367,"Highly recommend taking this with JDRS, you will learn data analysis skills in R that are very useful for most majors in todays data-driven world. There is a prerequisite of having taken one stats class before, but most of the stats material is reviewed at least briefly. Also, you do *not* need to know any R before taking this class! Grading can be a little unfair at times especially when the exams are take-home and many students get answers off of friends who have previously taken the course, so there is an aspect of getting out of the course what you put in.","r"
99367,"Yes, it's very possible to be successful in the course, and there's many availabilities for help and support. I know some people were worried about it getting curve down, but this year the letter grades were A: 94 and up, A-: 91 and up, B+ 88 and up, B 84 and up, B- 81 and up.","r"
99367,"I would. This course gave me a great introduction to working with R, and taught me some basic statistics to boot. You DON'T need to take an introductory stats class before taking this course - I had never taken stats before, but was easily able to learn the necessary basic statistics along the way.","r"
99367,"Yes. It is a good introduction to coding with statistics and using R. Especially with the flexibility and asynchronous course format, combined with the fact that so many other students that you know will likely be taking the course, it is definitely one of those courses to try out to see if interests you.","r"
99367,"Yes, quick Qr course, engaging prof","r"
99367,"I would recommend if if a student needs experience in R in particular and has no background coding experience.","r"
99367,"Sure but Id encourage them to credit d f if they are behind going into the project","neu"
99367,"I would recommend this course to any students who are looking to learn R. If you are just trying to fulfill a data science pre-requisite, it might be better to take an intro stats class such as S&DS 100-108. This class is too much work for just a pre-requisite. But if you are specifically looking to learn R this is a great course to take.","r"
99367,"Yes I would if you are interested in learning effective and basic R coding","r"
99367,"Yes! Will learn necessary skills.","r"
99367,"If you are a self-motivated student and want to learn R, this is an excellent class to take. If you require more structure or do not have a statistics background, then do not.","neu"
99367,"I would recommend this course to another student as I think it was taught effectively and coding in R is a useful skill.","r"
99367,"I would recommend it to another student if they are interested in statistics and coding.","r"
99367,"The course has definitely improved from previous semesters in terms of curve and accessibility to learning support.","r"
99367,"Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This was my first S&DS course at Yale, but I found that the class provided us all of the tools we needed.","r"
99367,"yeah I think for someone like me who wanted an introduction to statistics and R it's a great course to take","r"
99367,"I would recommend it as data science is an incredibly valuable skill to have and knowing R at a basic level is also widely useful across many disciplines to understanding data and statistics more fully.","r"
99367,"Yes. It made me become much more interested in stats and data science. The professor was very interactive and fun.","r"
99367,"Yes, it is a good class to learn R.","r"
99367,"Yes, I think this is a great introductory course to statistics.","r"
99367,"Yes, the professor is really nice and helpful--the way he explained concepts are very easily understandable.","r"
99367,"Yes, it's useful and well-organized.","r"
99367,"Yes! This course is well-structured and organized, and the datasets included both in the lectures and homeworks are very helpful to get an understanding of how the statistical tests and analysis works 'in real life'. The homeworks and take-home exams add to the workload, but they are really good to make sure you actually understand the concepts and retain what is discussed in the lectures. Also, there are lots of office hours available, so if you are interested in the content and/or have questions, there is always help available. As a student without previous stats knowledge before coming to grad school, this course was a good continuation from the Intro Stats one.","r"
99368,"Yes! Especially for the Stats and Data Science certificate.","r"
99368,"if you want a 5th credit or an easy 4th credit, yes. if you want to learn R, yes!","r"
99368,"Yes, it is not too tough and you learn some good stuff.","r"
99368,"Yes","r"
99368,"yes","r"
99368,"yes it's a good intro class; you develop good skills; good for stats certificate","r"
99368,"Yes.","r"
99368,"I would recommend this if you want to do statistics and learn something slightly more advanced than t-tests. I would not recommend this if you like CS and want to learn R as a language. You would be better off using other learning materials.","neu"
99368,"Yes if you're looking for a QR to cover the basics of what you need to understand social science research","r"
99368,"It's an easy class (if you are careful and willing to check over your pset for simple mistakes). No if you wanted an intro to statistics. Yes if you wanted a sixth credit.","neu"
99368,"Yes, I would like to recommend this course for students who want to learn R.","r"
99368,"Absolutely! You learn practical stuff and improve or learn R programming and Statistics","r"
99368,"Yeah, sure. I mean realistically, you're probably taking this course as some sort of requirement for Stats major/certificate or like a PLSC/EPE/ECON major. But I think it's fun. If you have any amount of analytical dawg in you, it's super fun to poke around and play with data. I really enjoyed it. But don't expect it to be the most exciting in terms of the class part.","r"
99368,"Yes, this class teaches students lots of data analysis techniques.","r"
99368,"I would because it is a good way to fill the stats certificate, but I still think this class could be improved in many ways.","r"
99368,"Yes, if you want to learn how to code in R.","r"
99368,"I would recommend if you want to dive deep in R","r"
99368,"Yes if the want to learn R, and especially if they have another area of interest they want to apply it to (eg. bio research).","r"
99368,"I would recommend this course to other students because the instructor explained the concepts very clearly and effectively.","r"
99368,"Yes. Workload is good, course is well organized.","r"
99368,"Yes, if you want to learn how to use R for basic statistics. It's a manageable workload and completely asynchronous. The recorded lectures are good but it is easy to fall behind on them.","r"
99368,"If a student needs a QR requirement and has completed the initial statistics, I do recommend this course. The office hours helps a lot in understanding the material of this course.","r"
99368,"Yes, I think this course is fun to listen to and we can learn practical skills from it.","r"
99368,"Yes, I would recommend it if you're interested in learning how to use R in a pretty chill environment.","r"
99368,"If interested in learning R. Good for that purpose, although not a fun class in my opinion (still worthwhile to pick up that skill though)","r"
99368,"Great way to learn R and build some statistical foundations.","r"
99368,"Yes, JRDS is kinda a Yale celebrity because he is such a fun character. You gotta have that experience at least once. Also, a yale 100 level class will prepare you for this wayyyyyy more than AP stat if you don't already have coding experience. The TAs are a bit nit-picky on the things they take off points for which can get a bit silly. But overall worth it to have an asynch class which we desperately need more of here at yale.","r"
99368,"I would definitely recommend this course! If you are interested in statistics or R at all, this is a really helpful and important introduction. It was fairly consistent work with regular psets and take home exams, but there is so much support and guidance available.","r"
99368,"Yes, if you're interested in learning basic stats and improving R skills.","r"
99368,"Yes, definitely. R is crucial to any sort of science or social science that would require statistic analysis, and this class is a great introduction to R.","r"
99368,"Yes, as long as the student has basic knowledge of statistical concepts.","r"
99368,"I would, but only if they have background with R.","r"
99368,"I had to take this course, so I don't know.","neu"
99368,"I think it is a good class to take as a fifth credit, and I did learn a lot about data analysis that makes it easier for me to read scientific papers.","r"
99368,"yes, it is well designed and fun","r"
99368,"If the student was interested in biostatistics and research, I would definitely recommend because I think the skills taught in this course is very applicable and necessary to research and statistical analysis.","r"
99368,"This course is good for learning R and should be taken by those who want to get a sense of what statistics courses will be like.","r"
99368,"Yes if you want to learn R and know little of other coding languages. Personally I think one can fairly quickly pick up R if have any form of coding experience.","r"
99368,"Yes, but only if they're planning to actually do the work. Don't do what I did and skate by with help from friends and then realize at the end that you could've gotten a lot out of it, but didn't.","r"
99368,"I would probably not recommend this course because there is such a rough curve down in the class that it is unlikely you will get an A. Also, the grade of assignments comes from harsh detail-focused point deductions.","dr"
99368,"If needed, yes","r"
99368,"It's a good class for basic stats concepts and it's not hard to do well in the course if you stay on top of the material...at least I don't think it's hard to do well but the peer grading system for the final project is very disorganized and as I'm writing this there is 1 hour until senior grades are due and we still don't have our final project grades yet.","neu"
99368,"super good","r"
99368,"I would recommend this course to another student if they want to learn how to code in R on a beginner level or if they want to learn basics of statistics. I would not recommend this course to students who have more R experience.","r"
99368,"I would, it is an accessible course that teaches R and useful statistical analysis techniques.","r"
99368,"Yes very useful skills","r"
99368,"If you want the A then sure but if you want to learn then no","neu"
99368,"Yes - remember to word hard on the final project.","r"
99368,"I'd recommend this course to anybody interested in learning how to code in R. It also provides an introduction to various statistical tests.","r"
99368,"Yes, good fundamentals.","r"
99368,"i think it's a useful class for all majors - especially those in stem/social sciences","r"
99368,"It is a good choice for learning R and some statistics method!","r"
99368,"Definitely recommend it. Gives you the skills to take random data and make meaning out of it","r"
99368,"eh its alright; JDRS has very good lectures, but the psets need to be made a little harder to generate a real grading curve","neu"
99368,"Yes, buy watch out for the final project. It can be tough to get everything together. Also do it with your friends.","r"
99368,"Yes, especially if you would like to use R for statistical applications in research, personal projects, etc.","r"
99368,"If you want a chill class, yes. But you will get paranoid towards the end due to the way how the class is managed and the different things you are hearing.","r"
99368,"f you're looking to develop a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical techniques, and R programming, this course could be a good fit. It covers key concepts and provides you with the necessary skills to work with data, conduct statistical tests, and perform regression and correlation analysis. Additionally, the inclusion of best practices, data cleaning techniques, and visualization tools like ggplot2 can be valuable for practical data analysis.","neu"
99368,"Yes! definitely. I think the skill you learn is pretty useful and it is taught well. I think the grading is a little too particular, for example, you can easily lose points for very small things in psets which takes away from the fundamentals of being able to use R.","r"
99368,"I would . Its a solid course that will really boost your R skills and give you a nice bag of tricks and techniques. Very well taught .","r"
99368,"Definitely. It really helps one know various useful concepts in data science","r"
99368,"Yes, I learned a lot and received help when I came across challenges","r"
99368,"I would recommend this course to everyone who is interested in statistics in order to get a basic sense of what you will likely encounter in the future.","r"
99368,"yes, because it has no exam but used homework to equip the students with enough practices","r"
99368,"I would recommend this course to anybody interested in data analysis and learning the more creative side of quantitative analysis. I also feel that the structure of the course makes it easy to tailor to one's learning style.","r"
99368,"Yes if they are interested in learning R and already know statistics.","r"
99368,"professor dope","neu"
99368,"I would definitely recommend this course to any student who does well asynchronously and wants experience in R and statistics whether or not they are a statistics major.","r"
99368,"Yes, I like the comprehensive introduction on R","r"
99368,"Yes. I would however remind them know that they have to be fully responsible for all of their learning if they choose to watch lectures online.","r"
99368,"Yes. It is an easy course to get introduced to R.","r"
99368,"I would recommend the course to another student.","r"
99368,"No it probably tanked my gpa, i thought it would be cool but i dont feel like im very confident in what i learned with how jdrs tuaght this and there wasnt any grading transparency until only after the credit d deadline passed and then we were told his cutoffs for getting an A would be extremely high which i didnt expect and i think it just encourages cheating since you basically need a perfect score in every assignment to get that A.","dr"
99368,"Yes if you dont have any knowledge of R and just want to learn how to use it.","r"
99368,"Yes, I think this is a good course for anyone looking to improve their R coding skills and apply biostats concepts to real world problems.","r"
99368,"Yes, I would recommend this course to students of any majors. Data is a part of life for everyone, and is becoming an even larger part, and thus learning how to better interpret data models is a skill which is tremendously beneficial in the modern world.","r"
99368,"Yeah, if you want to learn r take this class.","r"
99368,"I would recommend this course to any student looking to get more familiar with R code and especially apply statistical analysis to their coding for the first time. It is a beginner friendly course and helped me start my interest in doing data analysis with coding.","r"
99368,"Yes! Great intro to R with breadth and depth","r"
99368,"Yes, I will recommend this course to others, as I think data science becomes increasingly important to many other fields nowadays. This course will definitely facilitate their research.","r"
99369,"I think this class is a logical progression of improving ones skills in R or statistical analysis.","r"
99369,"Yes, it is helpful but still do not know how to connect it with public health","r"
99369,"Yes","r"
99369,"No.","dr"
99369,"Only Multivariate stats course and definitely can get through it without too much difficulty as long as you have a strong reliable group.","neu"
99369,"Yes absolutely for the stats majors, stats certificate, and even non-stats people as it is easy to pick up!","r"
99369,"If you're majoring in something social science-related and/or are pursuing the S&DS certificate.","r"
99369,"Yes! If you're doing the S&DS certificate, take this. For sure.","r"
99369,"Yes! Love JDRS! Take it if you're involved in S&DS in any capacity, or if you're experienced in R and looking to apply statistics to social science research.","r"
99369,"I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. you will not regret taking this at all! however, beware of which TA you get. some TAs grade more harsh than others. also, like s&ds230, the final project is graded by other students. so, there is a high chance you will not get a great grade on the final project, but if you do well on the assignments, this shouldn't be a problem.","r"
99369,"Yes. Really useful for practice","r"
99369,"Yes for S&DS certificate or major. It's low stress and group work. No if not pursuing either of those things","r"
99369,"Definitely! Very useful and I'm quite confident I'll continue using these skills in my research.","r"
99369,"Sure. This course is very helpful.","r"
99369,"Yes, if you're interested in learning some multivariate statistics.","r"
99369,"Yes, especially if it counts towards your major. Learned a lot of programming techniques in a low-key way, and enjoyed the real life applications of the class.","r"
99369,"If interested in data analysis, yes.","r"
99369,"Yes, it is helpful.","r"
99369,"Overall, I would generally reccomend. If you are going to take this class, make sure you have a group to work with as this will lessen the difficulty by a lot.","r"
99369,"Yes if youre interested in Multivariate Stats","r"
99369,"Yes, of course! This course would provide powerful multivariate statistical analysis methods and skills that can be widely used.","r"
99369,"Yes. Very interesting methods and the prof is great, very helpful.","r"
99369,"Yes, I think this is a good course to have to learn multivariate statistical techniques not found in other courses","r"
99369,"Definitely recommend it to those interested in multivariate methods with good statistical background. Though the workload can be heavier than others, it is a great way to practice what you've learned.","r"
99369,"Yes, if you are very interested in the subject!","r"
99369,"I wouldn't take it unless you need it for the major or certificate but if you do need it for one of those ya, it's pretty easy. The peer grading on the final project is so dumb and means that 40% of your final grade depends on how other students grade your exam (JDRS literally doesn't grade the projects, your grade is the median or mean of your peer graders' scores) so beware of that. But all in all, pretty interesting and not that hard and no exams.","dr"
99369,"Yes, if you'd like to learn more about multivariate techniques for data analysis","r"
99369,"Definitely yes! JDRS is such a fantastic lecturer!","r"
99369,"Yes. This is perhaps the best stat course out there that provides training in multiple softwares in application.","r"
99369,"yes","r"
99369,"Meh, if you want to learn about a bunch of multivariate separation procedures and have an easy class with low work","neu"
99369,"Yes!","r"
99369,"Depends on your tolerance for risk. Everyone gets perfect grades so the curve is broken pretty arbitrarily. Even worse, that arbitrary choice is made by other students since the final project is peer graded. A component of that peer grading even asks other students to compare your project to other projects, which means you could end up with poor or terrific outcomes due to chance. Additionally, when you are peer graded the grader has no idea if you did the project alone or if you got to work in a group of 5. Not really fair for your work to be compared to that of 5 Yale students collaborating. If you get lucky, this course can potentially be an easy A with low workload.","neu"
99369,"Yes! You don't have to attend a single in person lecture, the class is low workload, and you learn a lot. One of the easiest classes in the stats major/","r"
99369,"Yes I would if they were interested in the topics or if they were an S&DS major.","r"
99369,"super good","r"
99369,"I would recommend this course if you want to learn about multivariate stats methods, but not if you're just looking for a stats class to take.","neu"
99369,"Sure, it's a good follow up to S&DS 230 and a great introduction to multivariate statistical methods that are helpful in the social sciences.","r"
99369,"I would recommend this course to another student because the information learned is applicable to a variety of fields.","r"
99369,"I would recommend this course to another student because I liked the format of learning approximately one technique per week. I felt like I learned as much as I could have over the course of a single semester.","r"
99369,"Yes, it teaches you how to think and improves your technical skills","r"
99369,"more R practice and learn interesting techniques in R","r"
99369,"Yes, if you are interested in data analysis using computational tools.","r"
99369,"The workload is okay, but you dont really learn a lot compared to other stats classes. the grading can be questionable at times","neu"
99369,"Yes, very good overview of many different stats techniques - useful for data analysis in all kinds of fields.","r"
99369,"Its the same format as 230 without any of the instruction. I only recommend it if you have a group of friends you can take it with.","neu"
99369,"ABSOLUTELYY!!! This has by far been one of my favorite classes at Yale. I would highly recommend this course to someone who has taken at least one statistical course at Yale since I do believe that it really helps to have that foundation in order to better understand the concepts discussed in this class. Everything that we've learned is extremely applicable to the real world so students can benefit greatly by taking this course!","r"
99369,"Yes! This was the first course I took that introduced me to multivariate methods. The lectures were well organized and the notes were very thorough.","r"
99369,"I would recommend this course to another student only if they are willing to put in the time (and have partners to work with). The skills you learn in this class can be applied in many other contexts, which makes it suitable for anyone in any major. However, it can be frustrating having to do the project and homework by yourself or with just one partner, especially since it takes quite a bit of time to perfect the assignments to receive full-credit. The skill you learn, though, are very valuable and transferrable.","neu"
99369,"Only take it if you need it for the certificate/major","neu"
99369,"It depends. Its a decent data elective, similar in format to other JDRS classes. Some techniques are really interesting, and you can apply them to your own data, but dont expect to find everything interesting or applicable.","neu"
99369,"Yes, I think this course gives students useful tools for data analysis that go beyond some of the basic methods covered in an introductory stats/data analysis course. I would recommend it not only to other students in statistics but to students in other technical fields who are interested in dealing with data.","r"
99369,"Absolutely not! Do not take this course thinking you will get an easy A because the grading is insanely arbitrary, with almost 50% of it being a project that is peer-graded! Do not take this course if you actually want to learn multivariate stats (which is a super important and interesting topic), because you will learn none of it. I retained nothing from this class and probably didn't even get an A. Again, do not take this class! I have no clue why everyone likes JDRS so much because he completely butchers such a fundamental topic.","dr"
99369,"Yeah. Not the most fun or interesting, but okay all around","r"
99369,"Yes you learn good techniques but more so conceptually more than really knowing how to code these techniques","r"
99369,"Yes! This is a great class. Anything with JDRS is a must-take, since he's such a good teacher (go to in-person lectures! They aren't required but you won't regret it!). The workload is extremely chill and you get to work on everything in a group setting, which is helpful for the times when we blow by content very quickly. I just wish the grading was more generous (like they grade you out of 90 with up to 10pts extra credit but the denominator is 100, and for the final project that's 85), so even though there wasn't much work, getting an A kinda comes down to who your grader is (this year, per an end-of-semester email, a third of the class got an A but over 70% got at least an A-). Just make sure you do all the work on time and keep up with the class, and it'll be a very fun way to learn more stats that you don't really see in other classes.","r"
99369,"Yes! This was a great course and I would recommend it to anyone wanting an introduction to multivariate statistics.","r"
99369,"Yes, I think everything you learn is very applicable!","r"
99369,"Yes. The course is really helpful for those in social sciences.","r"
99369,"Yes because this very useful.","r"
99369,"Yea!! Really useful course. Broad overview of different types of multivariate analysis.","r"
99369,"Yes for expanding on R knowledge or specific application/prep for your own research. I used it for the S&DS certificate!","r"
99369,"Yes. However, I wish YSPH offered advanced AAME so I could've taken that instead","r"
99369,"Yes, would recommend to someone wanting to do statistics","r"
99369,"Yes, it is a great way to learn and practice some very important techniques and JDRS is an incredible professor. The grading/assignments were annoying but not a dealbreaker","r"
99369,"I would recommend this course to students who want hand-on experience with multivariate analysis and practices with R or SAS.","r"
99369,"Yes! This is a great way to rapidly pick up a bunch of important Stats skills, if you have any interest in research or data science. Having not done S&DS 230, it was also quite readily accessible to somewhat with a bit of an unrelated background in Stats. If taking it for S&DS then you must take it for a grade, if you are taking it casually I would recommend taking it pass-fail to alleviate any grading stress. Also, I would recommend finding a group you really trust and then getting started on the final project early and focusing more on making it clear and aesthetically pleasing than on getting the coding right.","r"
99369,"Yes, I would recommend to other students who may want to gain depth knowledge in statistic","r"
99369,"Yes, I think it is very useful especially when working with research","r"
99383,"I would recommend this course to a first-year interested in sociology.","r"
99383,"Yes, if you are interested in sociology at all this is a great introductory class.","r"
99383,"I would recommend this to a student who is interested in sociology, as it is fairly graded and interesting with not a whole lot of work. I made the unfortunate error of taking this course along with other really challenging courses and was not able to commit a lot of time to this course.","r"
99383,"Yes! This course made me declare sociology.","r"
99383,"Yes.","r"
99383,"Yes, if you are interested in socy.","r"
99383,"Yes. I think it is a unique course with new perspectives. I enjoyed learning the course and look forward to potentially learning from Professor Smith in the future.","r"
99383,"Yes! I would highly recommend to any student who likes thinking critically about the world around them. The workload is manageable, Professor Smith is great, and the content is extremely interesting.","r"
99383,"Yes, if you are interested in pursuing socy degree or for pre-meds interested in something outside of typical sciences","r"
99383,"I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone even slightly interested in sociology or the topics listed on the syllabus. It's honestly a really easy class. I skimmed the readings right before section every week, and that was enough to keep up and contribute and also to remember the major themes for the midterm and final. You have to study some for the tests because they require you to know people and specific ideas, not just common sense, but it's not too bad. Also, it was just a really interesting class. Professor Smith is pretty funny and definitely does a good job of explaining each topic. It's a great course if you want to fulfill a distributional rec or just take it for fun (like I did).","r"
99383,"Yes, it was more difficult then I expected but the class was very engaging and rewarding","r"
99383,"If you're a sociology major, I imagine it's probably required or you're probably already inclined to take it, so I'll assume that you aren't a sociology major. In general I think this is a fair course to take - it gives a lot of thoughtful directions of thinking, and connects to a lot of different topics in my own life/that I'm personally interested in, and gave different views on these topics from new lenses. I think it was a good experience to sit in lecture/section each week and reflect on how different aspects are life are social - I think that the course helps you exercise that muscle, and I think this helps me think about my own life more critically, and it's certainly something that I think many people can benefit from. It's a solid choice of course for fun or for social science credit I think.","neu"
99383,"Yes! Very fun class","r"
