It was really interesting to see how it is used in the real world, and it helped me comprehend the material more. I also learned a lot about educational inequality and different ways to look at and tackle the situation (conduct historical or legal analysis). One of the most important skillsets i learned was to condense information into a single page."

97324,Learned about studies in schools and how to assess performance
97324,I learned about the public education system and how it has become what it is. There is also a lot of group work so I think I really developed my teamwork skills and how to work with people you may not know or do not enjoy working with.
97338,I learned how to analyze a tv show as a political scientist
97338,I now understand cultural references about the show.
97338,Almost nothing.
97338,The politics of the wire. The show
97338,"i learned a lot about the social and political atmosphere of various issues like the war on drugs, organized crime, police brutality, and more"
97338,"Critical analysis and questioning of crime, the law, and how the environment in different areas is a breeding ground for types of lifestyles"
97338,N/a
97338,great class to learn about politics!
97338,"About the applications of ""The Wire"" on social science concepts in American cities"
97338,I learned how to use social science skills to analyze certain concepts in a tv show and apply it to the real world.
97338,"I learned how to view, analyze, and interpret TV media through political science frameworks. I also gained critical insights and political science theories to describe local politics, policing, and community efficacy,"
97338,Golly. I watched The Wire. That is about it.
97338,I learned about how to apply social science concepts to the media we consume
97338,Use The Wire to contextualize political science theories and data
97338,I learned how to watch tv shows in a political science lens.
97338,"I developed an appreciation for some of the realities of American cities, including issues of crime and policing, residential segregation, unions, local politics, and local journalism. I also developed an understanding of some of the skills necessary for a career in the social sciences and practice with using them."
97338,"Through this course, I learned more about the political and civic structures in a major city like Baltimore, as well as the competing interests among different groups. Through the lens of The Wire, I learned how to evaluate different mediums (e.g., a television show) and situations through a social science perspective."
97338,"I learned a lot about the day-to-day impact of the criminal Justice system, the drug trade, and local politics in a segregated American city."
97338,Integrated a TV show into discussion of complex political science concepts.
97338,Knowledge about US cities and systemic discrimination
97338,I learned a lot about American politics and the way that the modern city works.
97338,"This course is very theoretical, covering social science concepts like motivated reasoning, the principal-agent problem, and social norms. It has a particular focus on politics at the city level, discussing issues like police violence, institutional hierarchies, and residential segregation. In addition, the course teaches students how to ""think like social scientists,"" interrogating data and causality and coming up with hypotheses and experiments."
97338,"After taking this class this semester, I learned how to think, learn, and interpret data and research findings like a social scientist. I also went into more depth about certain topics that I had heard of- such as the War on Drugs, the HomeOwners Loan Corporation (HOLC) and redlining, residential segregation, Carceral contact, dynamics of the inner city, the drug trade, and so much more. This show is the cream and crop of all crime shows on television because it is the most authentic. It doesnt show the olive and investigators solving every single case they get- in fact, its the opposite. It shows corruption. It shows the misuse of authority. It doesnt make the public view the criminal justice and policing systems in a God-complex manor; in fact- its the opposite."
97338,I learned a lot about the complexities that take place within America's inner cities and the many moving parts that it takes to operate a city. I also learned about new research theories and methods that pertain to inner cities and especially the police.
97338,I learned about the issues facing American cities and how to understand these issues through the lens of social science concepts and The Wire.
97338,The wire is an amazing show you learn a ton about life in underprivileged communities. The class itself is not so inspiring though
97338,I learned about the American city and how institutional structures interconnect and act upon communities of color.
97338,"I developed knowledge of the show and lots of social science concepts that are related to it, like policing and segregation."
97338,Knowledge of how a lot of bigger cities work.
97338,I learned knowledge of how cities work and some of the main social constructs of our lives. I think almost all of the things learned were very important and it was taught in a fun way: television.
97351,I learned so much about African American history and HSHM.
97351,best class Ive taken at yale
97351,Learned about the history and present nature of racism and its interactions with healthcare in America.
97351,"I really enjoyed this course. I learned so much about systemic racism and how that has been implemented in all areas of the world, but especially healthcare."
97351,This class taught me how to critically engage with scientific information through the lens of racial disparities
97351,I learned how much history is intertwined with the world we live in today. I specifically gained a deeper understanding of the institution of slavery and how it intersected with the beginnings of healthcare.
97351,sickness and health in aa history
97351,I learned more about role of medicine in African American History
97351,"How to critically assess scientific facts, thinking about race and medicine, thinking about the history of medical and scientific exploitation, and much more!!!"
97351,Major healthcare issues regarding African Americans dating back to slavery all the way to the present. So many important topics discussed
97351,"I learned about the many, and continuous, disparities that exist in the realm of healthcare, specifically targeting Black Americans."
97351,"Learning about the history of scientific and medical racism in the United States and topics such as maternal mortality, the Tuskegee experiments, and racial algorithms."
97351,"So much about African American history and how it relates to medicine, from slavery to the present day!"
97351,I learned african american history in a medical context.
97351,SO SO much. This course really taught me so much about historical events that were swept under the rug and allowed me to understand how all the events intertwine and connect to impact people of color today. I have come out from this class with a bigger consciousness of my indirect biases and to evaluate situations not just on the surface.
97351,Racism in medicine
97351,I learned a tremendous amount about the historical and present-day implications of racial discrimination in the United States' medical field.
97351,so so much about history and health disparities
97351,"I learned about the racial disparities in healthcare today, as well as its historical context -- the long and messy history of discrimination against African Americans in a medical/scientific setting. We also learned about methods of resistance throughout history, and opportunities for improvement (what we can personally do now and going forwards) to address many of the injustices facing the healthcare system today."
97351,"Learned so much about the history of medicine, specifically about the racism embedded in science."
97351,"roots of healthcare (and other) inequalities, current disparities and how they were built upon the history of slavery, how we can seek change"
97351,"This course will change the way that you view medicine. If you're pre-health or even if you just care about the state of medicine today, take this course. You will be the better for it. There are too many insights that I developed to mention, since each lecture is full of important and relevant historical material."
97351,"I learned more things in this class than I can comprehend or articulate right now. I learned a better, more accurate view of American history and our interconnectedness with history and the past."
97351,"This course provided a comprehensive overview of the history of medical racism, as well as contemporary issues."
97351,"I learned how to reflect on course material and I learned a lot about the history of African American access to healthcare in the U.S. over the span of centuries. This class made me gain a lot of empathy and sympathy, and I feel like I am more prepared now to tackle issues of injustice and discrimination when I encounter them outside of the classroom."
97351,"This class is insane, and I do not think I will ever take another one like it. There is so much intricate history that interconnects with health, societal structures and dynamics, race, and why modern day movements are justified and built on truly saddening and often-times maddening foundations from the salve trade to the BLM movement. It was shocking how little I thought I knew about the material. Each class ended in applause as if it was a bunch of mini-TEDtalks and every applause was deserved."
97351,"The course provides a thoughtful and detailed overview of race and medicine in the US from slavery to the present with strong historical groundings. It traces many threads through history and teaches students to draw parallels, make comparisons, and dive into individual projects on topics of interest."
97351,"The foundations of African-American History from the trans-Atlantic Slave Trade to the present. Professor Roberts provided this foundation for her students so that they can understand how the issues we were facing today in the American society are deeply tied to historical racism. I learned about profound leaders in history and today (the amazing guest speakers) that I had never heard of in my high school education. I learned how deeply intelligent enslaved individuals were, especially in their healing practices, and how history has been distorted to disguise this. This was a refreshing course, I am so grateful to learn the true history, I use this in my life every day."
97351,I learned about the healthcare system in America as it relates to black Americans.
97351,This is a must-take course!! I learned about a history that is so relevant and so often dismissed. I think everyone at Yale should take Professor Roberts' class!
97351,"It's hard to sum up all of the material that I've learned throughout the course of this semester because it's so much and all of it, not deserves, but needs to be shared. I was familiar with a lot of the material in the class yet it felt like I never knew anything at all. Professor Roberts covered a large timeline from before the Transatlantic Slave Trade to modern day and in that she broke down various topics with respect to the era of the material. It was a very conducive method of teaching and very organized from the perspective of a student."
97351,Learned how to think critically about the dark history of the U.S. as well as the racial implications in the medical field. Learned how to be a more open-minded and empathetic doctor.
97351,"I learned about the history of Sickness and Health in communities of color, the (ongoing!) racialization of medicine, and discrimination within the healthcare system."
97351,"I loved this course!!! learned so much, and changed as a person in terms of using my voice to advocate"
97351,I learned about sickness and health in African American past and present.
97351,The affair that race and science have that is not talked about enough
97351,You learn so much about the history of the medical system and the different ways it has continued to oppress people of color. This class covers so much important content from the way slaves were used as human test subjects for medical exploitation to mass incarceration and the racial history of policing. It genuinely changed the way I thought about the world.
97351,The class taught me how much we dont learn about how racist ideologies are so engrained in American society. It taught me about how racism can be deadly in the medical sphere.
97351,"how the institution of slavery affected and continues to affect generations of African Americans, especially in relation to their health -- be that physical or mental"
97351,The history of inequalities in medicine and health and the interconnected factors that contributed to a system of discrimination against African Americans.
97351,I loved this course so much! Best class Ive ever had at yale.
97351,"I know how a great understanding of the deep history of African American healthcare, and medical and psychological violence committed against Black peopke"
97351,I learned about the intersection of medicine and racism.
97351,"We learned about both historical events and modern history that have contributed to the current state of racism. We learned to trace specific events that occurred during the periods of slavery, summer of 1919, the yellow fever epidemic, and many others to particular lines of thinking present today."
97351,"My personal growth happened throughout the semester, as I began to find ways to make small changes in how I understood the medical system. Creating the lesson plan and syllabus allowed me to comprehend how much work it takes to teach any theme in this course, such as racial science, stigma, bias, and racism in medicine, or medical exploitation. In my final project, I tasked myself with discerning how Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives would be best incorporated into the healthcare system."
97351,"I was already somewhat acquainted with Black history before taking this course, but this course taught me about the struggles of Black Americans throughout the country's history on a much more intimate level than I expected. Even as a non-STEM major, the health focus of the course was so interesting; it is mind-blowing to think about how perspectives on Black health changed from slavery to the present. I also learned how to work to my own standard of excellence rather than a professor's, and it helped me gain a much healthier outlook on life as a Yale student. Take this class!"
97351,"I learned so, so, so muchall very, very important things. From the belief that Black people were immune to yellow fever to the racialized aspects of modern day kidney function diagnoses and eGFR, this course showed just how entrenched racism is in the U.S., produced and maintained and operating in the medical system."
97351,I learned various lessons about the history of medicine.
97351,I learned more about the history of the medical field and examined how it has shaped modern healthcare accessibility and treatment procedures. I learned how to improve my writing skills to synthesize historical content with commentary and analysis.
97351,"This course taught me the history of medicine in the United States, specifically its racist origins and how those harmful legacies continue today. The course also taught me the role of academia in perpetuating violent practices and prejudices."
97351,"This course covered so many things I wish I was taught earlier in my education. It focuses on racism in the healthcare system, and covers a huge range of topic within that field."
97351,I LOVED THIS CLASS! I learned so much more about the horrifying history of the U.S.
97351,I learned a LOT about the history of medical racism in the US.
97351,African and Africna American history in the context of health and disease
97351,We learned about the intertwined histories of racism and medicine dating back to the time of the Atlantic Slave Trade and extending into the present day.
97351,Greater understanding of medical racism and its violence against African Americans.
97351,How to think critically about the ways in which Black people have been and continue to be negatively impacted by modern science and medicine
97351,"a paradigmatic shift to my understanding of history, as I now view history as being deeply connected to the present - a strong working knowledge on the history of medical racism in America within the larger historical contexts of the transatlantic slave trade, slavery, Jim Crow segregation (and how all of these persist in structurally racist practices and disparities today)"
97351,It helped a lot in learning about the history of how medicine practices came to be.
97351,learned so much about both the history and present of healthcare in the US with respect to all different kinds of disparities
97351,How past systems of oppression are deeply intertwined with current medical care and sickness and health.
97351,I developed a deep understanding of the relationship between Black people and American medicine and its deep historical roots. This is the most impactful and important course I have taken at Yale. I feel like I have left this class with a new perspective and am so grateful I Ajax the opportunity to take this course.
97351,I learned so much about African American history and medicine! I loved this course so much!!
97351,"By taking this course, I grew to be more informed about the legacy of slavery within the United States, and how that legacy is still very much alive in modern society. I've also become more aware of how biases have permeated themselves into the medical field, and the importance of being vocal about the necessity for change within this country."
97351,"Historical context of the intersection of health, medicine, slavery, and race. I gained insight into current injustices and stories of medical racism that reflect the deep history of U.S. medical exploitation, exclusion, and harm towards people of African and African American descent."
97351,I learned so much about healthcare and how much of it is rooted in systemic racist medical practices.
97351,"This course taught me so much. I think one of the most important things that I learned is the way in which the effects of slavery still persist in so many different fields in our everyday life. I learned to view the world in a much more intersectional, causal way. Nothing about the world is isolated; the past informs the present, housing affects health, etc. In addition to all the academic knowledge that I gained from this class, I also got such a wonderful insight into this utopian way of doing academia thanks to Prof. Roberts and the rest of the teaching staff. It was a wonderful experience being able to take a class on my own terms and I will forever be grateful that I had the opportunity to do so during my time at Yale."
97351,"This course has taught me that long hidden history of African Americans' contributions to the medical field, both willingly and unwillingly. It's a brutally eye-opening course that Dr. Roberts takes care to guide you through with the intent of understanding why there continues to be disparities in health outcomes between Black and other race patients. This history is absolutely necessary to know for anyone going into the medical field, and it is an important lesson in developing empathy for your patients."
97351,We learned about the history of racism and how that has continued to create inequalities in healthcare and society.   We also learned to have challenging conversations and to challenge our own personal bias and beliefs.
97351,"I learned about medicine and race, and I learned about many aspects of American history that are not covered in a typical US history class in high school. A specific line that I will take with me beyond this class is that history is necessary to understanding the present. Every issue of inequality that exists in society is a result of the history of this country, and until everyone learns the true history, perfect/all-encompassing solutions to these issues will not be found. Slavery and"
97351,I gained a good understanding of slavery and lives of enslaved people in Americas in the past.
97351,Untaught history and treating history and learning with immense care
97351,A lot about history that I didnt know.
97351,How Black people were used throughout history in the medical field and the structural racism that exists in the field today
97351,"Learned how to critically analyze historical documents, learned so much about how racism lends itself to poor health outcomes in minority communities, and left motivated to change the medical system"
97351,I learned a lot of deep insight about the history of African Americans and how it ties into health systems both today and of the past.
97351,"I learned about the history and present day impacts of medical practices as they relate specifically to Black Americans. This course taught me parts of history that I had never been taught before, but are extremely important to understanding our current world."
97351,A deep understanding of African American history through the lens of science and medicine. Insight into the sobering reality of present day American healthcare.
97351,Learned about African American history in the United States and related health issues
97351,"This course overviews racial disparities and inequities in the healthcare system by tracing the ways in which they are deeply rooted in the aftermath of transatlantic slavery. Guest speakers are additionally invited to give personal, anecdotal stories of injustices that they have experienced in the medical field. Ultimately, this course is about racism and the ways in which historic and present transgressions are deeply entwined."
97351,"Learned about the history of racialized medicine, how science is not objective but rather steeped in bias, ways of resistance and countering ones own biases."
97351,Understanding of African American history since slavery
97351,"I learned about how various systems, events, and biases throughout the history and present of the United States have impacted the health of African American people."
97351,I learned to think critically about biology and the medical field to examine how racism has been woven into our healthcare system.
97351,The history of health and slavery
97351,"Overall I gained lots of insight into how African Americans have been treated by doctors and the healthcare system throughout history, all the way from the slave trade up until the present day. Rote memorization fo specific dates, names, and other historical facts was not heavily emphasized, but I definitely came away from the class with a much better general acknowledgement of how Black people have historically been taken advantage of and exploited by the medical field."
97351,I learned so much about the history of slavery in America and how many health practices were initially tested on African Americans. I was also relieved to learn how systemic barriers for Black people actually formed over time in the U.S.
97351,"This course is an amazing re-education of U.S. History, telling largely forgotten stories from the perspective of Black Americans. More than anything, it teaches students to interrogate dominant narratives of history, and to remember them so that we can make the future better."
97351,I learned the history of medicine and science in the context of race and gender. So much of this course opens your eyes to things you never even considered to be linked to some well known figures and events in history.
97351,I learned so much in this class about the empowerment and historical exploitation of Black bodies that I did not know before.
97351,I learned a lot about black history which is a history I had not truly delved into before.
97351,"About the history of black people's role in medicine, including how they have been terribly mistreated, examples of advances black people have made without getting recognition, and how we can have a role in remedying the existing racism seen in the medical field."
97351,"I learned about the true and authentic history of American medicine, and how it originated from the exploitation and maltreatment of black people."
97351,"I learned more about the racial health disparities in this country, both historically and currently."
97351,I learned a lot about African American history in regards to the medical field.
97351,Gained an in-depth understanding of the history of oppression in Americas health system.
97351,Learned about the history of our medical system and how African Americans have played a role in medical research and experimentation and the inequities that we still face in our medical system.
97351,I learned about the history of medicine through the perspective of African Americans and the hidden history that is not normally talked about.
97351,"I cant really sum up what I've learned in this course. In terms of skills, I learned how to turn a course into an experience, to complete an assignment and envision its end goal being beyond the grade.   In terms of the knowledge I gained, I learned about a sadly really corrupt system of medicine. I learned to deconstruct the assumption that science and empirical study are absolved of human judgement and biases. I learned that my ancestors were natural healers and my people are resilient. Every topic we studied this semester was something I had no previous awareness of, even though I've spent a lot of my life learning about civil rights and black struggles."
97351,"I learned how to effectively learn and take notes in a lecture class, this being my first ever large lecture."
97351,"How our entire medical system in the US was built upon the exploitation of black bodies, in so many ways that you could not even imagine until taking this course. should be required for all students, but especially pre-med."
97351,"I was extremely lucky to be able to take this course. I learned about the history of slavery that continues to perpetuate institutional systems within America. Examples of historical moments within this course include slavery, the creation of gynecology, and the GI Bill. This course completely flipped all the history courses I have taken during high school. American history is oftentimes whitewashed and Eurocentric and the histories of people of color are left unaddressed. Through this course, I learned how to be antiracist and how racial structures continue to kill lives."
97351,"This course provided me with foundational knowledge integral to understanding the barriers within and systems upholding our racist healthcare system today. I believe everyone should have to take this course, especially if they are entering the healthcare workforce, as it taught us to think critically about the structures and patters we see around us, and the history of slavery and its impact on medicine which still impacts patient care."
97351,Incredible insight into African American history
97351,learned many things but mostly about the ways american medicine was founded in slavery and how racism is still deeply entrenched in healthcare to this day
97351,"Through taking this course, you will gain a deep and well-rounded knowledge of medical racism in the United States. You will gain a good background in African American history through the lens of the medical field."
97351,Deeper understanding of black history in America and how the past heavily informs the present systems.
97351,I learned so so much about how racism is embedded into the healthcare system and how important it is to acknowledge this
97351,Learned so much about the history and intersection of medicine and healthcare.
97351,Great insight on African American history... fantastic teaching and sections
97351,"I learned about historical and current public health issues, racial disparities, and connections between now and the past."
97351,"I learned the disturbing, forgotten, important history of healthcare with regard to African-Americans."
97351,I learned more about the nuanced history of racism in medicine.
97351,I gained a lot of knowledge about critical thinking skills and using a historical perspective to make judgements on a lot of existing institutions.
97351,"An amazing course that takes a historical approach to understanding medical racism, tracing it from the beginnings of the slave trade to contemporary day. In engaging with this history, we learned not only an incredible amount of content but skills in historical analysis, research, and close reading."
97351,Combination of emotional and intellectual interests
97351,I learned so much history that I had never known about the development of American medicine and racial science and how they continue to affect the lives and health of Black Americans today
97351,In this course I learned a lot about history and AFAM history through the lens of health and health care. I learned how to think critically about these issues
97351,"This class unveils the reality of the deep roots of racism in American healthcare. It covered many topics surrounding medical misinformation, so you gain a greater sense of how important it is to challenge such ideas as they have a deep impact on the lives of others."
97351,"We relearned the history of African American people and how the centuries-long oppression and violence still continue to this day, particularly in the medical field."
97351,"this was the best class I have ever taken, I learned so much, the environment of the class was like nothing I had ever experienced."
97351,THE BEST COURSE EVER.
97351,"I learned a lot about healthcare disparities, the history that influences and in some cases dictates patients' diagnosis and treatment."
97351,"This class filled in many important gaps in my knowledge of history from general high school classes. I also learned generally how to think critically about scientific ""objectivity"" in its relation to racism and oppression."
97351,I learned about the depth of racism in medical context and everywhere. This is a very important class to take.
97351,History of medical care black Americans have received from the Atlantic Slave Trade to present-day. Focused on how to approach problem solving and solutions for centuries of injustices.
97351,"I developed a deep knowledge about the history of Black people in the United States, and how that has influenced healthcare and medicine."
97351,"I learned much about the inequality of healthcare, and as a white man, it was something I had not heard of before. The shocking truth is one that I believe everyone should know and understand."
97351,I learned how to look critically at the US medical system. I learned how to write lesson plans about sickness and health in US history.
97351,"the best class i have taken at yale, the most important class i have ever taken, and the most important material that exists in the world to learn. this would not be possible without the expertise and care that dr. roberts pours into this class."
97351,I learned a lot about african americans and the different pieces to the history of health.
97351,"I learned a lot about the racist history of the US, especially relating to the origins of medical practices and the healthcare system, and how it continues to inform present realities experienced by African Americans in very significant ways."
97351,"I learned a lot about this important history, which really hasnt been sufficiently covered even in other HSHM courses at Yale. I also learned so much from Professor Roberts, Who shifted not only my approach to history but to learning more generally."
97351,"A comprehensive overview on the systemic political, social, economic, and cultural barriers to equal healthcare as experienced in the past and present."
97381,"Excellent understanding of 19th century America: its political, social and culture atmosphere and its many discontents"
97381,"I learned a huge amount about the Civil War, including the 15 years before and 6 years following it. I learned of so many different perspectives from which the story could be told, read a tremendous amount of primary documents, and discovered that the Civil War is one area where it feels impossible to have an original take."
97381,Consuming a lot of historical info; contextualizing history
97381,"Somebody in a past evaluation said that you learn how to skim readings, which I agree with. You cannot do all the readings for this class; it is 200-300 pages a week of often quite dense material. So you have to learn how to get the information out of the readings that you need in the time you have. My suggestion is to prioritize McPherson and Foner so you understand the facts, and try to get to McCurry and Charles Dew (125 pages!), then go to the primary sources books only when you're writing your papers. Also, most of the books are available free online, so don't spend $200 buying books you'll barely read."
97381,"I learned so much about the Civil War and American History in general that, as an international student, was very interesting. After this course I kind of get the whole American patriotism and where the fundamental divisions in this country stem from. One of my favourite courses at Yale for sure!"
97381,"Primarily social and political perspective of the antebellum era, civil war, and reconstruction. Many new insights about the nuanced perspectives from soldiers to home front families to leaders.

97381,"Great lectures and reading about the causes of the civil war, the war itself, and reconstruction. All the lectures were great, we wrote two essays, and there was a final with good writing prompts."
97381,"Through this course, I learned in-depth about the years leading up to the Civil War, the war itself, and Reconstruction. The course especially deepened my knowledge of the social history of the Civil War, because much of the course focuses on the experiences of individuals instead of just the major figures discussed in textbooks, like Abraham Lincoln."
97381,"I learned how to critically analyze the Civil War, especially in its economic causes and efforts, as well as become a better writer of history."
97381,"I learned a lot about the antebellum era, the Civil War, and Reconstruction."
97381,"I learned a lot about the lead up to the civil war, the war itself, and reconstruction. I really enjoyed learning about northern and southern life during this time. I also appreciated how the course did not solely focus on military history."
97381,This class made me appreciate the whole civil war era much more than I had previously.

97381,"I developed skills in creating analytical arguments using first-person historical documents as well as secondary academic sources, with a particular focus on synthesizing evidence in order to refute or support arguments from course-assigned texts. This course enhanced my knowledge of the causes, effects, events, and historiography of the Civil War and Reconstruction periods. It allowed me to build upon my knowledge of not only political events, economic patterns, and battles relating to the period, but also social history, and the narratives of individuals who lived at the time."

97381,"Overview of the causes, conduct, and consequences of the Civil War era, with strong emphasis on the intricacies of events such as the processes of emancipation and the Civil War's impact on the American identity. If anything, the course provided me with a strong foundation of Civil War history and a look at the intricacies of Civil War and Reconstruction events that are often presented as monolithic in high school classes."
97381,"I feel like this course taught me a lot about what I don't know as a history major and what skills I need to improve on. A lot of this class was making big claims about overarching themes, which was something I wasn't used to. I also learned a pretty nuanced view of the Civil War that I hadn't had the opportunity to learn about before this class."
97381,"This has been the best course I have taken at Yale thus far. Professor Blight's lectures are engaging as well as fascinating. He does a wonderful job opening up the world of the Civil War & Reconstruction era to his students. This class's strengths are its Professor, teaching faculty, and material."
97381,A great grasp of the Civil War & Reconstruction!

97414,"This course was an incredible survey of South African history, from the beginning of Dutch colonisation in the 1600s, to the legacy of apartheid and state of politics today. Magaziner is one of the best lecturers I have ever had - he is a natural storyteller and makes the course like a narrative while keeping it intellectual and informative. We looked at a mix of primary sources as well as reading interesting autobiographies and novels which gives you a look at the period from many different angles. The workload is significant but not challenging if you keep on top of the readings and there is room to experiment with the essays and do creative versions of you ask in advance!"
97414,I learned about the history of South Africa that started when white settlers arrived on the countrys shores.
97414,"Critical analysis, organisation"
97414,I learnt an immense amount of knowledge about both contemporary and foundational history of South Africa.

97414,"I learned a lot about South Africa, particularly about its earlier colonial history."
97414,A history of South Africa. An understanding of the history of the country and what that means for the future. How this impacted all groups of people in the past and the emotions and feelings behind it. Very impactful and very important.
97414,As someone who knew little to nothing about South African history I learned a tremendous amount. This is a very comprehensive and fast moving course spanning several centuries.
97414,"I took this course on a lark after I hated another course in my schedule during shopping period, and I am so glad I did! This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. We comprehensively covered South Africa history from the 1600s to present using a incredibly thoughtful selection of key events, places, and people to serve as illustrative case studies."
97414,"Through the lectures and course materials, I gained a critical, multidimensional survey of South African history. The lectures are extremely rich and in-depth."

97423,"For somebody like me who had zero background knowledge about African politics before taking this class, this course was a good introduction to some of the basic issues African countries and the African continent as a whole face today. I was exposed to some mainstream ideas and issues in African politics, like the lingering effects of colonization, oil's role in African politics, ethnic conflict, and levels of democratization on the continent. This class, as a kind of survey course, was great in introducing me to these topics. However, I did not feel that I learned very deeply about most of the topics. For that, I think, I would have to take a seminar or a more specifically-focused lecture course."
97423,This class gave a broad description of political trends in Africa. It was particularly interesting how many of the trends that were described are antithetical to the mainstream trends we see in the rest of the world.

97423,"Through this course, I was able to acquaint myself with several foundational themes of comparative politics. I also improved my analytic and argumentative skills through the eclectic range of assignments we had this semester."
97423,My biggest takeaway was learning some frameworks for approaching the study of African countries.
97423,I learned about the data-driven large study side of political science and predicting elections as explained by behavior. It was very different from the law side of political science.

97443,"Not much we learned about certain American Historical events that affected American culture, but there was no through-line of the course. The material seemed disconnected and disorganized."
97443,"The aim of the course seemed to be to develop a solid working knowledge base of the history of American culture by examining significant movements, events, and people. At other times, it seemed to be of a critical American studies class that wanted to evaluate a slew of movements. In both regards, the class had an aversion to any cohesive narrative or throughlines that killed any advantage of either approach. I ultimately left with a little more knowledge of American history (mainly from the readings, not lecture) and not much else."
97443,I learned about major moments in American culture and pop culture.
97443,Writing skills
97443,"Through taking this course, I gained a very limited overview of American culture starting in the 1950s up until the 1990s. We analyzed media for its cultural impact."

97443,"This course was so great and it really helped me develop as an historical thinker. I went into this class expecting more basic lecturing on historical events, but instead, I was introduced to not just this, but many different methods of historical thought. I was shown how different mediums, keywords, etc., influence our understanding of history. Thus, this class taught me about the development of American Culture over the last century AND about how we have thought about this development. This added insight was invaluable and caused me to have greater engagement with history and American Studies than ever before. Also, I had never written research papers before, so I really appreciated the opportunity to develop this skill."
97443,This course allowed me to think about time periods in history as segments of time that are interconnected on some level. I learned a lot about how political movements arose out of culture and music.
97443,I learned about American Studies as a field. The assignments challenged me to synthesize texts and articulate my own conclusions. I was encouraged to think about history in an interdisciplinary way.

97494,"Understanding of the ethnographic method, as well as a history of some important ideas in cultural anthropology."
97494,"Critical thinking and analysis that is anthropology specific. Generally, I learned lots of new concepts that felt very relevant to everyday life and feel that I can actually apply what I learned outside of class."
97494,how to think about the world and the way people are connected.
97494,"I learned so much about how culture creates the ways we see and interact with the world. I learned to critique and notice aspects of everyday life and connect them to bigger ideas. I learned about the history of anthropology, anthropological theory, and read a lot of ethnographies.  This class also showed me how academic/theoretical ideas can be applied to the real world."
97494,I learned about different concepts of sociocultural anthropology and gained a deeper understanding of human behavior. I also learned how to practice anthropology in my life as a student which helped me appreciate my surroundings.

97494,"The most valuable insight as an anthropology major is the review of the intellectual genealogy of anthropology. I enjoyed the discussion as much as Prof. Harms enjoyed it. It was important to know of the history of the discipline and its criticism. In doing so, I believe this course has prepared me for future courses in anthropology. It also provided a background on different ways to think about culture that I have not encountered before. If anthropology is a type of thinking, then this course has taught the critical ways of rethinking culture from an anthropological perspective well. I feel more confident in my choice of anthropology as a major.   The course assignments emphasized my writing skills. The ethnography assignments and the feedback I received made me more aware of the process of writing: how do we tell a story through ethnography and analyze it theoretically. In this sense, the course ensures my awareness of the discipline of anthropology in comparison with other writings."
97494,"Analysis of culture and structures of power, resistance, and violence. Ethnographic methods of investigation. Ways to understand the world and the study of humans beyond the conventional."

97501,"I learned everything about the law that law school would not tell me. It was a fantastic class, and in it, I learned so much about international law and informal law, and so many interesting things that I almost cannot quantify it."
97502,I enjoyed course content and expanding on global knowledge on wildlife and conservation efforts.
97502,I was able to better understand primate ecology and how it relates to human primates
97502,Primate behavior and ecology

As someone who took AP Physics C, the physics in this class wasn't too difficult, and learning about the applications was super cool. Professor Miller was a fantastic teacher, and I really enjoyed learning from him. The exams aren't too difficult if you pay attention in class (or rewatch the recorded lectures). The curve is very helpful as well. The problem sets can be completed relatively quickly with basic math (1-2 hours)."
97552,"I learned how everyday things such as cell phones, solar panels, MRI machines, and my eyeballs work. This class taught me the fundamental laws that govern basic function of an enormous range of things. I learned how basic physics applies to my life in an easy to understand way. I also learned about the Hairy Ball Theorem and how many right arms a salamander will grow if their left arm is moved to their right side. This class is amazing."
97552,"I learned a lot about technology and applied physics, and learned an immense amount about how different technologies work."
97552,I learned a lot about how different technologies work and some important physics and chemistry concepts that improved my understanding of the world.

97552,basics of physics
97552,"This course provided a good high level background on a variety of topics, including electricity, light, and information theory"
97552,A little bit of basic physics/ cursory knowledge as to how some technologies worked.
97552,"As someone who had already taken PHYS 180 and PHYS 181, I found this course to be an interesting extension of my prior knowledge. While much of the content covered in the class was reminiscent of basic high school physics, I found it to be a valuable review that reinforced my understanding of the subject matter. In addition, I was able to expand my knowledge by learning about the workings of various devices and technologies, including my experience with polarization sheets, which gave me a greater understanding of how light behaves and how it can be manipulated for practical applications.  However, what truly made this course worthwhile was the practical applications of physics that we explored. Through studying the workings of various devices and technologies, I gained a newfound appreciation for the role that physics plays in our everyday lives. Even though my knowledge of purely theoretical physics did not increase by much, I was able to apply what I learned to real-world situations, and that made all the difference.  In terms of skills, this course was a great opportunity to improve my iMovie video editing and PowerPoint preparation abilities. The final project in particular required us to combine these two skills in order to create an engaging and informative presentation. I found that this exercise not only improved my technical abilities, but also gave me valuable experience in presenting complex concepts to others.  Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about the practical applications of physics. While it may not be as theoretical as some other physics courses, the skills and knowledge gained here are directly applicable to real-world situations, making it a valuable addition to any student's education."
97552,"Very cool class, learnt about cool technological concepts!"
97552,learned how lots of new technologies worked. cool class
97552,"This course teaches you the physics behind all the key technologies that have meaningfully impacted our lives over the last century from phones, radios, lenses, displays, opitcal fibers etc.. It is almost a survey course that teaches you a bit about everything but not too much about one single topic."
97552,"I learned a lot about how the modern world works! We learned about very interesting and omnipresent technologies, and I now think of things I learned in this course almost every day. It definitely gives you a new perspective on technology."

97552,An introductory foundation into the physics behind technology ranging from VR to 3D glasses.
97552,"There were two major themes that we covered in great depth: electricity & magnetism and light/optics. I learned a lot about foundational physics, but from a very abstract perspective -- the higher-level mathematical concepts were largely ignored, especially in regards to material necessitating the use of calculus. Some of the more fascinating topics included how cameras work, how 3D images and films work, what fiber optic cables are, how our ID cards work to scan us into buildings, how our computers store data. Overall, the course invited us to more critically and concretely engage with the technologies that we use on a daily basis, and to understand more deeply and profoundly the world around us."
97552,"Physics of light, color, waves etc"
97552,Technical understanding of physics and its applications in modern tech
97552,The technologies in our everyday life and how they work.

97552,Physics!
97552,"By taking this course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of how various technologies work and the scientific concepts behind them. The course focused on electromagnetism as the foundation, allowing me to grasp the principles of electric and magnetic fields and waves. Through this paradigm, I explored the inner workings of smartphones, medical imaging techniques, solar energy conversion, virtual reality headsets, and more."
97552,Learned a lot of basic physics that I find has really helped me to understand daily technologies I use and phenomena I perceive.
97552,Physics
97552,Learned about how seemingly complex objects/phenomena can actually be explained by basic physics.
97552,"I learned about technologies around us, from plastic wrap to radio towers."
97552,"I learned physics principles and how to apply them to understand the world around us. This course made me a better thinker and helped me understand common phenomena and technologies (e.g., light, virtual reality, instruments, motors)."
97552,"I learned a lot about how the world around me works. As a history major, I hardly know how to save files as a PDF so it was fascinating to learn the way that things work in the real world. I also learned that I am not a good test taker. Still, as non-major QR or Sc distributional requirements go, this class is certainly manageable."
97552,I learned how a lot of every day technologies that we usually take for granted work.
97552,I learned how a lot of modern technologies worked and refreshed my physics knowledge.

97553,I learned multivariable calculus.
97553,I was able to gain a great introduction to multivariable calculus through this course. The course started with some relatively simple material and we were able to develop into the more difficult material at a great pace. I never felt like anything was rushed. The professor did a great job of tying each and every concept we learned into whatever new thing we were learning. I also like that this was an alternative to MATH 120. I gained some really practical experience with the concepts we were learning and it ended up being a great class for me.
97553,I think I learned how to be resourceful in terms of finding other avenues of understanding concepts outside of lectures.
97553,Cal 3
97553,I think this class most impacted my ability to think creatively about complex mathematical situations--thinking in 3D and how to best attack the problem from that perspective. It was helpful in conjunction with PHYS 181 because many of the concepts can be applied to both.
97553,"I gained a general understanding of multivariable and vector calculus concepts such as vector-valued functions, multiple integration, and partial differentiation. It built upon concepts covered in previous math classes such as differentiation and integration, but then applied to a multivariable realm. Several connections were made to intro-level physics such as flux and vector fields."
97553,"Evaluating double and triple integrals; Gauss', Stokes', and Green's theorems; LaGrange multipliers; visualizing 3-space."

97554,"I learned about ordinary and partial differential equations, lagrange transforms, fourier series, how to solve differential equations"
97554,How I best review for a test
97554,"Differential equations, laplace transforms, Fourier series, the heat equation"
97554,Its okay to leave a class and simply jsut read the textbook. I didnt learn anything in class and felt I still had to go. It would have benefited me greatly if I stopped going to class from the beginning and just read the textbook and consulted TFs.
97554,This class was pretty terrible. Lectures were awful learned literally nothing in class. So much work and had to teach myself everything. Pro tip: the Professor matters ALOT! If you can please find the best professors you can find and if not dont take this clsss with this instructor. We would have test with material he said would not be on the test and then the stuff we had been working on was nowhere to be found when we took exams. Zero star review.
97554,Solving ordinary differential equations
97554,"As the name of the course would suggest, I learned how to solve differential equations. Also, especially for the final third of the course, when we dealt a lot with series, the course served as a more intense version of most of MATH 115."
97554,"I learned basic techniques for solving both ordinary and partial differential equations, with special emphasis being given to important applications in the physical sciences and engineering."
97554,Learned how to recognize and solve first and second order differential equations and how they apply to real world phenomena.
97554,"Exam taking skills. Was not enough to memorize formulas and learn methods, really had to understand the meaning of the formulas and the proofs which led to deeper understanding of the material. Learned how to ask questions about meanings of mathematical formulas."
97554,"This class was ultimately very difficult and not taught in a way that made it easier to understand by any means. The only things I learned in this class that I think I will continue to use and remember are the basics, as I don't think I really understood much of anything that was going on towards the end of the class."
97554,This course taught me various methods of solving differential equations and helped me gain experience in solving those problems. The majority of the course focused on ordinary differential equations but at the end of the semester we learned how to solve some partial differential equations.
97571,-better understanding/respect for decorative art and the material world
97571,A good survey of basic decorative art history.

97571,"I learned an entire section of history that I would have never considered to have such depth and relevance. I learned to never look at an object the same, to consider all of its possibilities and its history."
97571,"I learned about the language of objects (the materials and processes that go into making an object). In particular, I learned about the making of ceramic, wood, textile, and metal objects, gaining a vocabulary to describe their processes. In the second half of the semester, I learned about the interchange of objects, how trade affects object designs/uses, how objects can be imitated/appropriated, how objects can carry different functions and memories, and how objects can enchant the viewer through visualization and touch."
97571,"Material literacy Approaching objects with a greater appreciation of the material, fabrication techniques, and the social lives of objects"
97571,I learned about the objects that are around us and how to analyze them in terms of materials and origin.

97571,"History of art, learned about making processes and trade and other aspects of art and its processes."
97571,It was a good overview of decorative arts and the themes it brings up (trade/globalization/appropriation etc). I learned a lot about a category of art that is often overlooked.
97571,"I learned extensively about the four primary mediums: ceramics, fiber, wood and base metals. I developed the ability to look at different objects and write descriptively about their distinct realization processes. Towards the end of the course, I learned about how senses enhance ones engagement with an object."
97571,"I gained understanding of various creative processes including those of ceramics, textiles, metal-working, and woodworking. I also learned about material and technical interchange through trade."

I also learned how to think critically and deeply about the material world around me and really appreciate the objects that I see in the YUAG. And, we learned how to articulate the life and importance of objects through museum labels."
97571,Understanding of the material and cultural aspects of the decorative arts.
97571,"Knowledge about materiality and the journeys of ceramic, metal, and wood objects over time and across regions and aesthetics"
97571,This class really made me look at the world differently. I gained a great appreciation for understanding everyday objects as products of manufacturing processes and of social and cultural forces. It was fun to learn about different manufacturing techniques -- I'd really never thought about how most things were made -- and to think critically about how everyday objects can embody these broader themes.
97571,"This course taught me how to look at objects and see the people and historical context behind them rather than just an object. It broke down hierarchical barriers between ""fine art"" and ""decorative art"" by realizing that the level of technical, artistic, and cultural skills necessary for both types of artists are entirely the same. Further, this course taught me a new way of looking at history by giving me insight into how to ""read"" an object, thereby allowing me to hear the perspectives of people who's testimony and experience is not, or is no longer, part of written, translatable record."
97571,"I learned a lot about the way I look at objects, and how they were created, and what they may have been designed for."
97571,"how to look at things and really figure out how they were made, from material to construction to influence and decoration"

97595,Learned about the organization of space on a global scale.
97595,Learned more about globalization and how the world works
97595,"I tend to keep my urban studies perspective pretty local, so this class was a great challenge to begin looking for global patterns of urban development and infrastructure that can take social, economic, political, etc. lenses."
97595,I learned to consider the ways spatial arrangements and patterns provide opportunities for life to grow.
97595,I developed my understanding of infrastructure space and got an insight into the layers of networks that work together when we think about space. Read in a variety of fields e.g. sociology.
97595,"I learned all about infrastructure space, how it is used, and how we can better improve our usage of it."
97595,Learned a bit more about the lesser known parts and history of the world and how they are connected together
97595,I learned about various phenomena of globalisation effects
97595,Globalization Space
97595,"I gained a surface-level understanding of some global systems, and a deeper knowledge on the topic of my final project. Otherwise, I learned very little."
97595,"Thought about infrastructure (broadband, roads, etc) as a reflection of broader histories/systems of power, oppression, and resistance."
97662,"I learned a lot about the universe, galaxies, and stars"
97662,"Lot's of astro and cleared up many basic physics misconceptions about relativity and black holes, spacetime."
97662,"Astrophysics, the formation of our early universe, astrological concepts..."
97662,"I was introduced to the major astronomical bodies in our universe, their composition, and their origins as it relates to the age of the universe."
97662,"I learned a lot from this course about astrophysics and astronomy. This course has a strong quantitative focus in terms of homework and exams, which felt relatable to other disciplines. After taking this course, I have a much stronger understanding of cool topics like black holes, galaxies, and relativity."
97662,"This course helped me to better my knowledge of astronomy, as well as appreciate the aspects of science that we know a lot about and what we truly have no way of knowing."

97663,This course gives you a decent understanding of planetary/ star/ solar system/ universe formation; great understanding of origins of life theories; etc. Helps put a lot in perspective
97663,Star formation and the search for intelligent life.
97663,"We learned a bit about astronomy, a bit about evolutionary biology and conditions necessary for the origins of life, and we learned a good amount about SETI."
97663,"I learned the fundamentals of astronomy, such as how stars form and how our Solar System came to be, then the development of life and evolutionary processes, and finally about extraterrestrial life and how we might go about contacting it."
97663,General understanding of star and planet processes; requirements for the formation of life and what to look for to identify extraterrestrial intelligence; potential ways to contact ETI.

97663,"I learned about star and planet formation, evolution of intelligent life, and some interesting theories about aliens of course."
97663,"I've developed an insight for SETI, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and how it correlates with the emerging field of astrobiology."
97663,I learned about the many misconceptions about searching for life in the Universe.
97663,"The course was partitioned into astronomy (astrophysics of stars and planet formation, identifying and detecting exoplanets), biology (origin and evolution of life theories, defining life as we know and don't know it), and astrobiology (defining intelligence, SETI/CETI). The course is definitely a broad review. I took it with an intention of building a general understanding of how intelligent life forms and was guided throughout the whole process step-by-step. I gained understanding of common astrophysics/astronomy terms like parallax or redshift and definitely feel more comfortable with the idea of exploring astrophysics in the future. The reading material is borderline philosophical in a good way, and I really enjoyed looking at being alive from a planetary & civilization-ary perspective."
97663,"I had a great time learning about the formation of the solar system, the stars, and planets. I also learned how to think creatively about the possibility of life in other parts of the universe and how we could look for it."
97663,"I knew nothing about astronomy or life outside of earth before taking this course. Now, I feel like I have a great surface-level understanding of what life could be like in space, and even have formed an educated opinion about it."
97663,Skills: thinking critically about science & scientific theories Insights: Our place in the universe!
97663,None.
97663,I gained knowledge about what the field of astronomy does and a lot about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. I learned some math calculations to understand how astronomers research in their field.
97663,"This was a great non-STEM science credit course. The content is interesting and Dr. Faison is a great lecturer. Its definitely not a gut but its doable, especially if you find a good TF. The tests are fair and the problem sets (while due at an unfortunate time) encourage you to research answers online."
97663,"We learned about the basics of space, star and planet formation and discover, then talked about the evolution of life and the possibilities of life developing elsewhere in the universe. We went over qualities of individual planets, exoplanets, moons and how probable it is for life to be elsewhere and what to look for. We then discussed the search for extraterrestrial life and the methods to try to make contact. The class provided a great foundation for astronomy as well as the search for life in the universe."
97663,"For starters, my perception of the vastness of our universe has grown. I always knew that the galaxies and the universe were big, and had heard of statistics like ""there are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on Earth,"" but I had never really comprehended this until I was exposed to the computer simulations presented in class that honestly had my jaw dropped near the end. Also, when I first heard of Astrobiology, I was completely confused as to what we would be studying. Biology means life, and throughout my life, this had never crossed over with Astronomy. Although part of this course did deal with radio signaling and hypothesizing what types of life we would find in the galaxy and what conditions is necessary for life as we know it, the real takeaway was how exploring how we could apply this to the history of humanity, from the birth of our star to the formation of Earth to the first organism to intelligence and finally how our technology is affecting our home and what we might see if we don't change our actions."
97663,"Knowledge about the functions of our universe, the biological makings of life and what life might look like on other planets, and the social/scientific implications from the potential of discovering alien life."

97663,"You'll learn a good deal of intro astro, less intro bio, and an interesting, but far too small amount about information theory, contacting aliens, extremophiles, and the fermi paradox. Frankly, the most interesting content of the course---theories about what extraterrestrial life might look like and how to contact it---was only discussed to a disappointingly low extent. Most of the information we 'learned' about extraterrestrial life was common sense---we literally spent class time discussing why it would be a bad idea to try and talk to the aliens in english and the rest you could probably get from a few hours of watching Kurzgesagt on youtube. I found the introductory astro part of the course interesting, the readings in general were quite good, and the p-sets were challenging enough that they forced me to actually learn and remember things, but I wouldn't really recommend this course. I had high hopes but it was disappointingly boring."
97663,"This course gave me a very surface-level overview of astrobiology, including the basics of star and planetary formation, origin of life theories on Earth, exoplanet research, potentially habitable exoplanets, and the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. It was largely conceptual and no one subject was explored with great depth, as it was an intro level class. There was some pretty basic algebra that was required but that was explained pretty poorly and a lot of that required figuring it out on my own."
97663,"A really great introduction into astrobiology, covers many interesting topics."

97663,I have learned a lot about the possible theories of the origin of life on earth and how to go about looking for life outside of earth. I have also developed my ability to do research on open ended questions and express my ideas on homeworks.
97663,"Introduction to the field of astrobiology, which is an amalgamation of multiple disciplines including biology, chemistry, and geology together with astronomy. The beginning of the class also refreshes some topics taught in Astronomy 110 and 120 (topics involving stars, galaxies, and the history and scale of the universe). Most of the class involves discussing exoplanets, Mars, and the many terrestrial moons of our solar system. Other main topics include origin of life theories, extremophiles , SETI, the Fermi paradox, the Great Filter, the Drake equation, interstellar travel via generation ships, and sending a message to a nearby exoplanet (our class chose Ross 128b)."

97992,"I developed my knowledge of discrete math, learning how to write proofs using strategies like induction, writing statements using predicate and propositional logic, and understanding the properties of sets, functions, and relations more."
97992,The basics of discrete maths and writing proofs.
97992,I learned the basics of proofs that will hopefully be useful for the rest of my CS career at Yale.
97992,"I learned a lot about discrete math, mathematical proof writing, combinatorics, and their application to computer science. This was the first time I had ever written mathematical proofs, and the course definitely gives you the opportunity to learn how to do so without harsh penalties."
97992,I learned a lot of math that would be helpful for CS
97992,"This course was a complete mix of too many topics. We learned propositional logic, predicate logic, how to write proofs by induction, contradiction, and other techniques, linear algebra, combinatorics, and big Oh notation. I won't say that I didn't learn a lot from the course -- I do feel that I am better off in understanding fundamental concepts that underlie computer science principles. However, there was too much going on. I don't think that I was able to really fully understand each concept before we switched to a new one. I mean really, one week for linear? Come on."
97992,"Developed skills in proof-writing techniques, set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory."
97992,"25% of the class scored a D- or worse in the final exam. 50% scored a C- or worse. And at least ~15 of the points in the final were simple Yes/No questions. This is not supposed to be a difficult course.  If that's not indicative of how poorly this course was taught, I don't know what is. Professor Glenn is not great at teaching this subject, and Office Hours and general feedback was severely lacking. I felt like I had to self-learn the majority of the content. I went to Office Hours multiple times to get feedback on my midterm exam and understand why I got certain questions wrong, but there were simply too many people who needed to get walked through the homework assignment. The main thing I got out of this course was the pressure to self-learn a lot of the content. I wish I had taken MATH 244 instead."
97992,This class helped me develop my skills in discrete mathematics and logic principles. It helps in terms of understanding concepts in more fundamental principle.
97992,"Critical thinking, proof writing"

97992,"I developed a broad knowledge base in the field of discrete mathematics by learning the basics of underlying logic, application of it within computer science."
97992,"To be concise, a fair amount of the math skills necessary to succeed in computer science - set notation, probabilities, some linear algebra, modulo arithmetic, RSA, etc. I would say the class was fairly theoretical - not necessarily rigorous - but certainly devoid of a lot of real-world examples, or at least a number I would have appreciated. I understand this is fundamentally a theory class, but having the class tied to more real-world applications rather than ""the number of perogies"" would have been nicer. Besides, why the hell did we spend so much time learning about the mcnugget problem (with perogies instead of mcnuggets)?"
97992,"All the stuff described in the course packet. But I'll list some off the top of my head: predicate logic, the idea of proofs(there were times during this course i wished they never existed, but it's really all about the proofs), to be patient and persistent- each weeks pset was a struggle, cldnt get thru all of it without OH's."

97992,Discrete math problem solving and logic
97992,I learned how to think about computer science problems more effectively.
97992,"Professor Glenn gave us an overview what a proof is like, but the class did not go into the specifics of it like I would have wanted. Students mainly took Glenn's lecture notes and tried to take that format for writing their proofs. I wish the proofs were a little more formal. Also, the topics of this class were everywhere. It was a whole new completely different topic per week that we did not go into much depth in the class so we were required to do it on our own for the problem sets. I guess the point of the class was an overview to all of these topics but I wish some of the topics were more in-depth so I could have learned them better vs. an overall sampling of all these math concepts. This is a class I think almost would be taught better over two semesters. Prof Glenn mentioned often concepts we learned is so we see it for the first time to be prepared for higher mathematical computing classes, but I think that those concepts should be solely reserved for our classes to make CPSC 202 more focused."
97992,"Introductory proof-writing, logic, probability, graphs and several other areas of discrete math. I believe this information would be useful for me in future programming efforts and also surprisingly helpful for my philosophy class, which ended up referencing the same logic notation."

97993,"I took 223 after CS50 and, to be honest, felt like I didn't learn much. I mostly relied on my knowledge from CS50 during the first half of the course on pointers. For the second half on object-oriented programming, I did learn a lot but not well."
97993,"I developed the ability to code in C/C++. In particular, I got better at working with pointers, since C/C++ are both very low level languages. Furthermore, I also got much better at debugging my code and also accounting for edge cases beforehand, so that I wouldn't have to debug in the future. I also learned better planning and organizational skills because I would start the psets earlier, instead of waiting until the weekend before to do them. This let me spread out the workload over a longer time."
97993,I learned more advanced C and C++ programming and the PSets reinforced this as well
97993,Honestly not much. Kinda disappointed

97993,"Very little. I do not think this class efficiently prepared me for computer science. It was poorly disorganized, and often times, many students left lecture confused, as the instructors themselves were confused with what they were trying to teach. Overall, this class was more of a burden having to deal with mistakes on the format and logic of psets and exams than being able to enjoy the true challenge of DSA. It was exhausting and frustrating."
97993,"C, C++, and how to implement data structures like vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and graphs. The problem is... in the real world, all of these data structures already have countless highly optimized implementations in libraries out there that you can just import. The focus of this course was much more on the implementation of the data structures than the *application* of them, that is, actually learning when it is mots appropriate to use each data structure. This was a severe limitation of the course."

It's an incredibly refreshing angle on computer science, which often is so focused on coldly building solutions for the highest bidder with only a veneer of ethics carelessly slapped atop it for marketing or funding purposes. Here I felt that the research I was doing and the tools I was using and building were providing material value to the world in a way that's more intellectually stimulating than nonprofit webdev and more direct than some of the pie-in-the-sky CS projects often touted."

Through the problem sets, we do learn how to think logically and use math in designing efficient algorithms. Those algorithms have (highly) impactful real-world applications, a fact that motivates the students to engage more with the material and work, for example, in teams to fully understand and utilize the valuable learned concepts."

I learned about millennium problems and some significant problems in the field of algorithms and cs. When I write CS logics now, instead of always using an n^2 loop to check everything, I start to think about efficient algorithms that can get job done much faster."

98004,"Almost no new knowledge compared to CPSC 223. The entire class is just an IQ test because understanding the lectures does not mean you'll get far on the homework or the exams. Also no new skills: basic induction or contradiction proofs. The point of the assignments is to be smart enough to come up with an algorithm that the lectures don't prepare you for. Most people end up collaborating with other students just to have something to submit. The only insight I developed by taking this course is that, even though I loved CPSC 323 taught by Abhishek, Yale just doesn't care about CS majors.

98005,"If you have prior algos experience (eg. from CodeForces), most of this class will feel like review. The psets take a while to complete due to the nature of writing correctness analysis proofs by hand or LaTex, but they generally had pretty well written problems.

98017,"There were many guest speakers - but they were very finance and econ based. We also learned different psychological tendencies, which was meant to help us create better decision making processes. However, it ended up being that we needed machine learning for the PSETs, which was never really taught, and it was assumed that we already knew. I think you need a lot of logic when coming into this course, but it's interesting to see how Slade turned a program into an English-generating decision process."

98167,"You learn the basics about how markets and economies work. It's not too mathy, mostly conceptual. If you never understood the business section of the paper, now you will. If you're not a Wall Street jock in training, this class also teaches you about global development, taxes, poverty, welfare, etc. -- things that are useful for a ton of fields."
98167,"It gave me a good picture of how the world economy works and why we have recessions/expansions, etc. Pretty interesting"

98167,Introductory Macroeconomics
98167,"I think that the most important insights I gained from this course was learning how we set up the parameters for measuring the economy, what causes the failures and how they affect the US and the world, and how we respond to these crises. Although there were formulas and math to learn, I think that understanding why we chose certain variables and how we related them to one another conceptually was what I was most interested in. I really liked how each unit built off of the last, and you could find the traces of pervious ideas and equations rooted in our current lectures."
98167,"I think I learned a bit about the world in terms of climate change and China. Most of macroeconomics still does not seem real to me (and TBH Aleh Tsyvinski explained in a way that made it even more inaccessible) so I still do not know how to apply most of the knowledge I learned. But, it was not a and class overall."

The bulk of this class focuses on optimal decision-making, centering around consumers trying to maximize their utilities to firms in different types of markets maximizing their profits."
98197,You get what you expect from an intermediate micro course - nothing special but i really enjoyed it and thought the material was covered well.
98197,"I developed knowledge about how consumers and firms maximize their utilities, Nash Equilibrium, externalities, monopolies, oligopolies, and how policies can work to encourage cooperation and mitigate externalities."

98354,"I learned so much about the English language! This course dives into the formation of the language, what influenced it over time, and how it has changed throughout history. One of my biggest takeaways is that language is not constant."
98354,"We learned how to examine texts critically through a linguists eye. Because the class was such a broad survey of the English language, we learned how to identify periods of English based on linguistic form, function, and meaning, as well as the historical events that characterized each period. We also spent a good amount of time on English grammar."
98354,"Five main takeaways: 1. English is constantly changing; when old norms leave the language, new ones swoop in 2. Language doesn't change independently-- people change language, often with sociocultural motives or implications 3. Dialectical variations have been around since the start of English. Judging people's status or credibility based on their speech habits is not a new practice 4. Singular people (Webster, I'm talking to you!) have had monumental effects on the development of English  5. Examining the influx of loan words to English is a unique way to trace historical contact. Depending on the types of words people picked up, you can hypothesize how close and impactful contact was."

98368,"Literally everything! All of it! In Introduction to Media, you learn how to think analytically, which is so incredibly valuable. You learn the frameworks through which to view everyday objects that we take for granted as media with histories and profound influences on the way society functions. You read countless fascinating academic texts and poems, watch the occasional tv episode, listen to music, view art, truly everything! The essay prompts enable you to take a deep dive exploring topics that interest you, and through revision with your TF, you improve the articulation of your thoughts."
98368,"I learned a lot more about the impact of media in our daily lives; technological media isn't the only type of media that is present, but media are all around us and influencing our daily lives and practice. It was so nice to analyze topics in a different viewpoint and learn about the deeper relations between objects and media."
98368,"In this course, I learned to think of things in a more abstract and defamiliarized manner. As a consequence, I've been able to think of a lot of things---not just those in the class---in a new way. The class gave me a whole new insight and perspective on media!"
98368,This class was very good at developing new types of thinking and writing skills from the readings and writing prompts there were given from the class. Though it was challenging I think it was good at developing new skills in reading and writing comprehension that we had not seen before.
98368,"Very much a mind blowing course. I was encouraged to think way outside of my comfort zone, especially as a STEM major. I also learned how to do readings for a course, which I had not done to the level of investigation that I had in any high school courses. I think each one provided insights and new knowledge that influenced my learning."
98368,Writing essays by compiling different works by media theorists. Analyzing the ideas of media theorists and reading often difficult texts. Interpreting philosophy in our age of media.
98368,"The course doesnt teach concrete things to memorize, instead it teaches you to think about and engage with the world in a different way. Thats not for everyone but for me it was amazing."
98368,I understand the idea of media in new way. It really changed my thinking what media are and how they function.
98368,It Was Nice to deconstruct my preassumtions of what media is

98368,"The special take that this class has on media completely changed my way of perceiving the day to day world. The papers we have read have given me so many different insights. Everything is media--the ocean, clouds, fire, bells, ships (and of course photographs, recordings, books, computers, etc)! And everything carries a message...whether you realize it or not!"
98368,"This is a class that expands your perception in weird ways. I learned a bunch of super random facts and a couple big ideas, all of which will stick with me for a while. The main takeaway was that I view human-made objects totally differently now--with a lot more attention and awe--than before taking the class."
98368,"Thinking about media in a new perspective, asking creative questions to everyday-life objects"
98368,I learned so much more than I ever imagined. Professor Peters is truly a mastermind and deserves all the accolade. Opened up a new perspective on film and challenged (while also emphasizing) various theoretical notions. I learned how to be clearer with my writing and how to look at different theories and apply them to everyday concepts.
98368,I learned how to evaluate media in an abstract way outside of their conventional forms.
98368,"I really got an understanding of how to defamiliarize and study media through that lens, which really helped deep dive into certain concepts. I also got a good understanding of the central ideas of media studies, including a history of how media has progressed through writing, video, music, and more."
98368,This course is really about defamiliarizing yourself with infrastructures. It helps you think outside the box.
98368,I learned how to understand how media affect our everyday lives. The knowledge I learned that there is a medium between everything we do or use. The insights I gain are that I will learn to interpret things in my life more in the mindset of how this medium affects what I am doing.
98368,media and mediums
98368,"I developed a much wider perspective on the way we interact with many different aspects of the world, as well as a new definition of media; learned how to deconstruct the world around me"
98368,This class was a wide-ranging exploration of media that gave me new insight into the intersections of media and power.
98368,It was an excellent creative course with a broad survey of human innovation. It really gave me a window into AI and how machine learning will affect creative endeavors.
98402,"Daily Themes forced me into the habit of writing in an efficient manner. I learned how important sentence structure and word choice is and can tell from my writings for other classes, cover letters, and emails that I have gotten better at writing."
98402,"I developed a daily writing practice, learned how to write in different genres and gained a better understanding of for and structure. This course prepared me to apply for creative writing workshops."

98402,I did get way better at writing
98402,This course taught me to write. I mean really write.
98402,"I got into the routine of writing every weekday and learned how to write without overthinking. As a non-English major, I also appreciated the lectures as a helpful introduction to the practice of creative writing, although I'm not sure how revelatory the material might have felt to students with more experience in creative writing classes."
98402,I learned how to find my own voice: I have developed my own tone and way of writing that is unique to myself.
98402,I developed an ability to write every day and take advantage of ideas as they come.
98402,Writing. How to write not what to write about. Writing for the sake of it.
98402,Daily writing practice was huge
98402,None. It is shocking how a class can be taught for an entire semester and I can feel like I left learning absolutely nothing new.
98402,I learned how to write.
98402,"Where to begin?   Through this course I-- - developed tools to help me communicate with clarity and purpose  - saw examples of writing styles that will provide a foundation for learning for years to come  - was exposed to, and inspired by writers in the industry  - was given the space to discover my voice, and feedback on how to strengthen it  My brain is a pile of mush right now considering this time of the semester, but this class was absolutely life-changing. I will never be able to write an email the same way again."
98402,"I was forced to become a better writer by churning out themes five times a week. I definitely gained a newfound appreciation for ""good writing"" and saw my writing toolkit grow."
98402,"I am a better writer all around for taking this class. This course not only changed the way I approach writing, but the way I see the world."
98402,"Your writing will improve, which is the point of the class."
98402,"So many personal insights, I am more connected with my inner soul now. I know all the themes I fixate on, and that words can be so powerful."
98402,"I learned about writing every day. It is an incredible skill and a joyful experience, though also more time consuming than I anticipated. I also very much appreciated the organization of the course around the elements of style."
98402,"I wish I were able at the moment to really articulate how great an experience this class was. It was definitely on my Yale bucket list, and I'm glad I was able to be a part of it. The writing-tutor structure allows you to get the benefits of a small class even though it's a large lecture. (I was surprised at how big it was at first, but it makes sense.) Professor Ehrgood's lectures were always the highlight of my week."
98402,How to brainstorm and write on a deadline. How to write at length about small things. Various elements of style.
98402,I really improved my writing. I thought the themes helped figure out my style of writing
98402,I learned more about writing techniques.
98402,Great creative writing practice
98402,Get much more comfortable with writing
98402,"learned a lot about consistency in writing and also how to be more experimental with my writing voice! also learned to be more conscious and intentional of how I use different writing techniques, including metaphor, exaggeration, scene-setting, dialogue...etc"
98402,"I got into the practice of writing daily, experimenting with my words and style more freely."
98402,I found my own voice in writing and learned so many new techniques to make my writing shine.
98402,"Writing as a daily practice, looking more deeply at specific uses of writing and what they do (ex: jargon, metaphors, lists, dialogue)"
98402,Honed the habit of daily writing
98402,"I am a quicker writing, I know more about essayists, I am more apt to recognize choices in writing, and I make better writing choices."
98402,"You learn that if you want to improve at writing, you have to approach the field with discipline. You have to be ready to put in the effort of just trying to write once a day. Soon, it becomes much easier and you can certainly feel your improvement increase throughout the semester. The class gives you so many different insights into different kinds of writing: poetry, dialogue, narrative structure, punctuation, etc. It is truly a once in a lifetime experience of a class, and a must take for anyone majoring in the Humanities/English at Yale."
98402,Writing! A lot!
98402,"I think I gained very little from this course. I lost a lot, like sleep and time, but gained? Not much at all. The only thing I developed was a hard shell when it comes to writing. I sometimes felt like I had to protect or defend myself with my tutor, which is such a terrible attitude to have about sharing one's own writing."
98402,Exercised my writing skills
98402,It was useful to get into the routine of writing every day.
98402,"I wrote every day and got to experiment with different forms of writing, though it's hard to tell if my writing actually improved."
98402,"How to write with specificity, clarity, and lucidity."
98402,Writing every single day allows you to much better understand yourself as a writer
98402,I learned how to write! I also learned about myself as a writer and what kinds of styles and methods I tend to gravitate towards.
98402,"There are certain things you can only learn by writing every day. This class holds you accountable for writing consistently, which is incredibly valuable!"
98402,-writing for an audience/considering what the reader will think -writing for volume. we wrote 65 pages worth over the semester -- now I have that many seeds for other pieces of writing
98402,"This course taught me about how to think about writing. Before going into this course, I did not have the conceptual understanding to describe why good writing was good writing. Each week, we worked with and discussed different aspects of writing, and by the end of the course, I found that my ability to talk about writing had greatly improved. Also: I developed A LOT of academic discipline through this course, which benefitted other areas of my work. It made me a bit more academically tenacious: there were days where I absolutely did not want to write 250 words, but I had to. I found that the process of writing, even on the days where I didn't feel like writing, or the days where I produced objectively bad writing, was more important than all of the finished Daily Themes I wrote."
98402,I learned so much from the practice of writing every day and really grew as a writer!
98402,Really good place to experiment with new writing styles
98402,"Skills: It's difficult to evaluate my own writing, especially so soon after the course, but I think my writing improved over the course of the semester. Each week of the course focused on a different aspect of writing (e.g. metaphor, punctuation, adjectives, lists), and I'm sure my writing is more proficient and intentional in all those areas. I also have a semester of practice writing almost every day.  Insights: I have the ability to write. My writing will not be of the same quality as the works I'm used to reading, but if I wanted to write a fantasy story (as I have tried and failed to do in the past), I could."
98402,"By writing every day, I learned through experience many skills and techniques that I can use to improve my writing. Having a tutor was also a big help, as I was able to learn with someone with a lot more experience than me."
98402,"It made me a better writer. It taught me ways to improve my writing by forcing me to write consistently and meet with a tutor every week to talk about that writing. It also helped me to appreciate writing and English more, as a STEM major who was never that appreciative of them in the first place."
98402,"This course taught me not just to write consistently, but to listen to my own writing and evaluate each small decision I make as a writer. From sentence effects to punctuations to dialogue to metaphors, etc., the course helped me collect new skills that I can draw from in fictional/non-fictional writing. The most important lesson from the course was how to be more conscious with each decision as a writer to make the whole piece sound better and work better on the reader. It was also very meaningful in how it made me reflect about my new life, changes, and philosophical reflections."
98402,Paying close attention to word choice and sentence length; how to use different techniques to maximize the impact of a piece and have it resonate with readers; how to be concise in my writing/storytelling
98402,"You get a lot of practice writing quickly and at a regular frequency (once per day). I enjoyed exploring similar themes in my writing, going deeper into the same topics over the course of several weeks, writing about similar things multiple times. I found that it's very helpful for me to constrain the writing: a prompt with specific guidelines, like ""use only one-syllable words,"" would lead to better writing than the ""free prompts,"" most of the time. Similarly, I would crank out a great theme on the days when I waited until there was only an hour left before the deadline, compared to the days when I had all day to write slowly and chip away at it. I also found that it helps immensely to try to form a full theme in my head, or at least the general feeling of one, before starting to write. To make sure that I don't just have one good sentence in mind, but rather a few sentences, the rough sketch of the ark of the theme, how it starts and ends, how it ties together, and best of all, when it connects to something strange and unexpected, that's when I would enjoy the writing most. Lastly, I found it extremely helpful to speak out loud while writing. Either reading my writing, or treat the exercise as a dialogue, where my writing is in response to a question a friend has just asked... These are some of my main insights from the course."
98402,I became a much better writer through daily practice.
98402,What writing styles suit me well and which ones are more challenging.
98402,"I really improved my writing, got to explore lots of different styles and developed my own style."
98402,"How to write in different, new, and better ways"
98402,I became better at picking good ideas or experiences to write about and piecing them together. I gained confidence in my writing abilities and am proud of finishing this class.
98402,"I improved at writing short reflective pieces, and I developed a greater ability to make myself write even when I didn't have any ideas."
98438,I learned about the European welfare state.
98438,"Introduction to comparative capitalism, basic background on the British, German, and Swedish models, methods used in political economic analysis"
98438,I learned a lot about comparative capitalism and the politics of postwar Europe. Gained skills for comparing welfare states in different nations and the effects of different policies.
98438,"A much greater understanding of welfare states, taxation, and the policies countries put in place to regulate their economies"
98438,"I learned how to compare advanced capitalist economies in terms of their institutions, paying particular attention to their wage-setting institutions and how this affected each country's unemployment, as well as the formation of the welfare state."
98438,I gained a robust foundation in the political economy of postwar European countries. The course was a great blend of quantitative and qualitative information.
98438,I learned a lot about the welfare systems in Europe. It's an interesting comparative politics class and I felt like I walked away with a better understanding of the political structures across Europe.
98438,"Many new concepts about capitalism, corporatism, the welfare state, party politics"
98438,I was learned more about social policy and the politics behind different social reforms or party transformations European countries. I learned how to characterize the political economies of different European countries and how to compare them. This was a good introduction into comparative government.
98438,"I learned about capitalism in major developed countries across the world (though primarily in Europe). This was actually incredibly eye-opening and caused me to realize that our standard understandings of ""capitalism"" are mostly limited to what we see in the United States, which is NOT reflective of capitalist economies in most European countries."
98438,I gained a great deal of knowledge about the welfare systems in European countries and how they developed.
98438,BEST COURSE EVER. Please take it. Everything makes sense now in global econ and why countries diverged in socialist states.
98438,Political economics and different approaches to economic policy; the political history of Western European countries; development of political parties and cleavages.
98438,This course gave me insight into how the labor markets and welfare states of Western European countries (and Japan) function. I gained familiarity with the vocabulary and theories of corporatism and a better understanding of what differentiates these countries from the U.S. I also learned about the recent history of these countries and how they responded to various historical crises.
98438,Great foundation of knowledge of comparative economics in 20th century Europe.
98438,We learned about european economies and welfare states from the post-world war 2 era to the present.
98438,Great class

98438,Comparative European politics in the postwar period
98438,I learned a lot in this course about the details of European political economies from the beginning of the 20th century to now. I also learned how to think like a political scientist and synthesize dense theoretical readings.
98438,I learned a ton about the political and economic structures in industrialized European countries. Learned about different political theories like axes of political competition. Such great context I think really helpful for any econ policy people to know
98438,"Learning how to apply general principles of political strategies to different countries over the course of the late 20th century, creating frameworks for comparing and contrasting different strategies employed by different government tracing general trends and responses. It was fascinating to be able to learn about a trilemma framework, then use that to compare strategies in Sweden, Germany, Britain for example, and then find deviations in the models in countries such as Japan."
98438,Learned about global financial structures and things such as labor unions and how different countries used them.
98438,"Information dump about the post-WWII development of the welfare state, practice reading dense poli sci papers."

98457,I learned the available renewable energy technologies that stand to aid our global fight against the climate crisis.
98457,Surface-level grasp of renewable energy systems and technology
98457,"The working aspects of different renewable energy forms including primarily wind, solar, and hydropower. There was also information on nuclear, bioenergy, energy storage, energy markets and geothermal which was interesting."
98457,How renewables can help shape our future
98457,"I learned so much! A basic understanding of how energy and electricity are generated, how different forms of energy function, and the financial and social considerations of energy"
98457,"I learned about the different shapes that renewable energy takes, and the global problematics surrounding energy. I learned common estimation methods that may be very useful in the future."
98457,"This is a fun survey to renewable energy! This might be the closest thing you can get to an algebra based physics class at Yale. You learn some E&M if you haven't already, and all about the major renewable energy sources."
98457,Good physics-based overview of different renewable energy technologies
98457,"Broad understanding of renewable energy, including the basic physics, earth sciences, and real-world applications behind them."

98457,learned so much about the feasibility of renewable energy! lots of physics concepts i did not know about before
98457,Renewable energy tech from a scientific economic and political perspective
98457,"This course is a fantastic introduction to everything renewable energy. Seriously underestimated how much I would learn about the energy landscape, future of energy, and science of energy generation. The interactive component of the course, where we have the opportunity to visit renewable energy installations, is a particular highlight that should be taken advantage of whenever possible. The course gives you a really strong grasp in particular of hydro, wind, and solar, and I especially enjoyed the lectures that dealt with how energy technologies interacts with the market. It was also helpful to have a basic understanding of the physical laws behind energy generation technologies, which I feel like are often glossed over in popular discussions of these technologies."
98457,"Learned quite a lot about the electricity grid, how electricity is generated and distributed, and about all the technologies involved with not only renewable energy generation but all energies. We focused particularly on solar, hydro, and wind, but it surprised me how many different types of renewable energies there are out there (there are 5 types of solar energy, and many different installation/size methods, there are multiple types of geothermal energy, there have been attempts to make biofuel energies and most haven't been successful. The content of this class was much more interesting than I expected."
98457,"You learn a lot of important technical aspects of renewable energy, which is pretty crucial if you want to talk about realistic scenarios for energy transition and net zero. If you don't know this stuff, there's always gonna be a disconnect between what you think clean energy is vs how it actually works."
98457,"I learned about renewable energy sources, how they work, are applied, and their benefits/drawbacks."
98457,"Knowledge of energy systems and markets, as well as the science behind lots of energy sources."
98457,"I learned so much about how renewable energy systems generate energy, how we generate electricity in the United States, new technologies, the true benefits and drawbacks of each technology. Awesome course!"
98457,had a very holistic understanding of renewable energy. prof oristaglio is a really good lecturer!
98457,"Science of renewable energy resources. By resources I primarily mean hydro, wind and solar with a more superficial look over other miscellaneous topics like biofuels, tidal and wave, geothermal etc.  By science, I mean where does that energy come from (think natural cycles), the extraction of energy from them, how to calculate that, and their pros and cons when it comes to supplying that energy to the grid. Some discussion about the energy market, specifically ISO New England, how it works etc. US centric though that seems unsurprising.  Generally gives you a good grounding of the basics of what goes on in renewable energy, let's you get a grasp of the basic vocab"
98457,"Basic information about various renewable energy (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass) and physics"
98457,Good info

98457,"Learned about the physics of the natural flows that power renewable energy (e.g. what drives the wind/physics of solar power), how renewable energy technology operates, and barriers to/supports for its implementation. Developed a broader understanding of the electrical grid/how our energy system operates."
98457,"This course is a survey in the main types of renewable energy generation, namely Hydro, Wind, Solar, and Geothermal. It focuses on the physics behind how they work, and also the economics of buying and selling energy of different forms. There is also discussion of how the electricity grid works, and the world energy mix."
98457,An overview of the science and practical reality of all types of renewable energy.
98457,Great overview of the physics of renewable energy with a good amount of the basic economics/policy side of things as well
98457,Learned about renewable energy. Good primer class.
98475,Deep knowledge of Eastern Europe and the ideologies and events occurring since 1914.
98475,I gained a comprehensive understanding of regional political and social trends
98475,"Survey understanding of modern Eastern European history, how to draw relevant information from dense readings, how to think about history in the ""longue dure"" and as rooted in specific geographies and moments."
98475,"I learned about the establishment and collapse of Eastern European nationstates in the interwar period, the ideologies which destroyed them and perpetrated the Holocaust and the Great Terror, and how those ideologies affected the countries and regions over which they had ruled over the subsequent decades up to the present day."
98475,I became fairly familiar with the region and also picked up some geography skills.
98475,"I learned a great deal about the political, economic, and cultural forces that shaped many Eastern European countries, especially in terms of how geopolitical tensions led to the formation, dissolution, and annexation of different swaths of land. We started off with the breakup of Austro-Hungarian Empire/decline of Habsburg monarchy, went through WWI, interwar, WWII, Stalinism, Brezhnev Doctrine, Hungarian Uprising, Prague Spring, Berlin Wall/Cold War, and ended with the formation of the European Union and Russia's most recent invasion of Ukraine in 2022."

98475,"I learned so much about Eastern Europe, European history, and some of the most striking chapters in all of human history: Stalinism, Nazism, the Holocaust, the Soviet bloc. Snyder also imparts lots of wisdom on the discipline of history, and how we ought to think about our pasts."
98475,"I learned more critical thinking. I had to think about what people in history did, and how their actions had consequences that trickled down through history."
98475,"This course completely reshaped my understanding about East European history in the 20th century, but especially from the interwar years and World War II. It helped open my eyes to how American schools teach European history with a western lens, often obscuring the perspectives of East Europeans. I'm so glad that I took this course and gained a more accurate understanding of the events."
98475,"History of Eastern European countries and general trends in the region and world; especially, I learned a lot about the failure of democracy in the early 20th century, the end of empires, the rise of totalitarianism, and its consequences."
98475,"Eastern Europe between 1918-pretty much now. Didnt cover WWI that much, so mostly began with post-WWI settlements. Majority of the second half is on communism which was super well taught and eye opening."
98475,"I found Professor Snyder's comments on history as an academic field/discipline/skill extremely insightful (and would've happily had more of them). I walk away from the course with a new appreciation for the role of details, such as dates, and geography, as well as better awareness of the ""traps"" to look out for / avoid when studying history."
98475,Major themes and events in Eastern Europe from the end of WWI through the present day. Snyder also emphasizes the different techniques and challenges when studying history more generally.
98475,Broad survey of events throughout the 20th century in Eastern Europe.
98475,"I feel like I think about history, especially Eastern European history, with a much higher level of complexity. Timothy Snyder is a brilliant thinker and historian, and his ideas and manner of thoughts are well translated through his lectures,"
98475,Learned a lot about Eastern Europe
98475,"This was my favorite course I have ever taken. It was so fascinating for me to learn about the 20th century, something I had studied before, in a completely different way, learning it from the point of view of Eastern Europe. I learned so much in this class!"
98475,Learned more about Eastern Europe and also how to read and write quickly and effectively
98475,"analyzing history, understanding how history would be different if certain events had not occurred, importance of geography in history, tracking development of one particular region over span of time"
98475,"I learned so much about Eastern Europe that I didnt know before. Professor Snyder made the information so clear, engaging, and accesible. I feel like I gained so much knowledge from this course."
98475,how to think critically about how individual nations/ peoples fit into the context of eastern europe as a whole
98475,"I learned about eastern European history, Stalinism, reform communism and the rise and fall of communism in the eastern bloc."
98475,"I gained an in depth knowledge of the mainthemes and events of 20the century Eastern Europe, exposure to some very interesting texts, and insight into real historical analysis"
98475,"Since this was my first lecture-only style class without presentations and slideshows to look over again after each lecture, I had to learn how to be efficient and sift through which information I should be recording as notes versus which information is interesting but unnecessary to take as notes. My hand can only move so fast and can obviously not keep up with talking. Additionally, this course taught me how to skim through and highlight the readings, since I can safely say that I have never had a course with even nearly this much reading."
98475,"A broad understanding of the recent history of Eastern Europe, with a focus on the USSR, Yugoslavia, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Some understanding of general historical trends/ analysis of the end of imperialism, the evolution of communist thought, and the liberal democracy."
98475,Eastern Europe from 1918-1995
98475,"I learned an incredible amount about Eastern European history and valuable lessons about how to apply it to the current world. This class was pretty light on work, so I didn't really learn any new skills."
98475,"Critical thinking, viewing history as perspective rather than narrative"
98475,"I developed ability to see the bigger picture of history, listen attentively with no electronics present, and memorization"
98475,I learned SO MUCH from this course! Highly recommend!
98475,"I learned a lot about Eastern European, a region whose history I did not have much prior knowledge about. I further developed analytical and critical thinking skills in regards to historical information. I also improved critical reading skills."
98475,I really feel like I got a comprehensive understanding of Eastern European history from this class! I understand a lot more about historical trends and the factors that lead the region to change and develop throughout the 20th century.
98475,Mostly about the history of the region and a new way of looking at the narrative surrounding WW2
98475,"I learned a lot about Eastern European history, with a particular focus on World War I, World War II, and Communist history.

98475,"I developed skills in reading large amounts of material, learning and deriving historical facts, and organizational skills."
98475,"A overview of the history of Eastern Europe in the 20th and 21st centuries. This includes various countries, political systems, social movements, revolutions, wars, etc. across the region."
98475,I developed so many skills from this class. I developed confidence in my ability to learn about something completely new since I had know knowledge of the region. I learned how to make arguments about contingency and history as a result of Prof Snyders lecturing styles. I learned about the process of selecting the most important events in historical narrative from the chronology.
98475,I developed a good understanding of historical trends in the region of Eastern Europe from 1914 onwards. I like how Professor Snyder does not treat 1914 as a demarcation and talks about pre-1914 national and imperial histories. Professor Snyder likes to open his lectures with acute questions or observations about the lecture topic. They are often thought-provoking and leave me in thought even after lecture. There was a considerable amount of reading for this course. I became a better reader.
98475,I learned about the rise and fall of different nations in Eastern Europe during multiple time periods. I learned what led these nations to ruse to power and what eventually led them to fall.
98475,"In high school, the narrative about the World Wars is very focused on Western Europe. This class not only fills in the missing piece of what was going on in Eastern Europe but also enhances the broader picture."
98475,History of eastern europe
98499,Tons of really interesting history and facts about food!
98499,"I learned so much about the history of food and all of the other histories that food is intertwined with. I also learned how to think critically and analyze qualitative histories in order to understand common trends and themes, and compare and contrast."
98499,learned about the history of the world/US through perspective of food
98499,"I learned about the influences that cause people to eat the way they do, on global, historical, and domestic levels. I learned about how migration patterns, environmental pressures, and taste preferences make cuisine."
98499,"The beginning of the course was focused on different regional and historical cuisines, and the latter half of the course was focused on the intersection between food and culture."
98499,Learned about food and how the preference for it has changed throughout time and location.
98499,"Learned a lot about different countries' cuisines, why American versions of certain national cuisines are how they are, food reforms, etc."

98499,"I learned about global histories of food and the globalization of food throughout various points in history. I also learned more in depth about the history of food in the US along the topics of restaurants, nutrition, industrialization, and cuisine."
98499,"Broad survey of global cuisines and their histories, history of food in 20th century USA, food and the environment"
98499,"I learned about the intersection of food and history, and how views of food have changed over the years and across the world."
98499,"Developed knowledge of history of food with emphasis on Medieval cuisine and modern American cuisine. Investigated intersections of war, colonialism, religion, and economics with food. The course's second half focused on modern America (19th century onward) -- specifically on food reform movements, the influence of immigrants on American cuisine, and matters of sustainability and nutrition."
98499,Learned all about what people thought of and did with the food they ate.
98499,"I learned broadly about cuisine, immigration, cultural trends, environmental challenges, etc. all things related to food really. What you learn for the papers is up to you too, so you can research something of interest to yourself, investigate your own culinary background, etc. You learn about yourself and one of your daily activities too through this course!"
98499,"A comprehensive understanding of cuisine around the world, as well as modern reforms especially in America."

98499,"I loved learning about the cuisines of the world and how food can be influenzed by politics, gender, race and class."
98499,I learned to look for significance in the smallest of things.
98499,"Developed a better understanding of the intersections of race, culture, gender, and food. Overall, it was very interesting to begin with the culinary history of other countries and regions, then transition to the history of food in the United States."
98499,The course helped me learn how to write more efficient notes while also being involved with the material. It also thought me to look at food through a different lens.
98499,Great class
98499,"The course content was all over the place. We went through major civilizations/cuisines, then food movements, and then looked at how food intertwined with social history and environmental issues. I explored Medieval European cooking and Elizabeth David (a cookery writer) through papers written for this course. I still read Elizabeth David."
98499,"Valuable skills in research, reading comprehension, lecture note-taking, and more."
98499,I learned a lot about food and got food experience with both historical writing and the style of big history lectures.
98499,"food history from the middle ages, across different geographical area, current food culture scene"

98610,I learnt more about international development.
98610,"The course is a broad and very general overview of topics in international development and features some methodology. I connected some of the concepts I had learned in ECON 116: Introductory Macroeconomics to economic development specifically. However, I was disappointed with the depth to which these concepts were covered: in many cases, it felt as though Approaches to international Development did not compare even to the depth reached in Introductory Macroeconomics, let alone ECON 122. Many concepts were covered only cursorily, and it feels as though the professor (who is new) should have received more support from other faculty in creating a useful course."
98610,I learned how to establish causal effects when conducting studies. I learned how to determine which variables should be included in my studies. I learned about the links between institutions and development and trade.
98610,Little to any. I learned how to merge data in STATA
98610,"Very little. Not much of the econ or stats material was new to me; most I had already learned in previous required global affairs classes such as JT's stats courses, the economics sequence, etc. I think the professor tried to incorporate a lot of Stata practice, but Data lab was not sufficient to actually master any Stata skills."
98610,This course taught me nothing new. All skills/knowledge required i got from past courses (mostly AQAII & intermediate macro).
98610,"Honestly not many. Just like security, was left feeling a little disappointed"
98610,I literally feel like this class was a repeat of Intro to Macroeconomics at best and a class that could've been taught in a single lecture at worst. I honestly have no idea why the class was structured the way it was. I have no idea what I learned.

98610,- some familiarity with econometrics - statistics practice from AQA
98610,"I learned Developmental economics in a much more analytics and in-depth manner. It was very much the realistic, more analytic component of the Global majors economics requirements."
98610,"Stata, research methods, surveys, patterns in international development. This was more of a development economics course than I expected, with a heavy focus on quantitative methods. The entire course was dedicated to ways of measuring international development, rather than strategies to achieve it."
98610,"Honestly, Im pretty disappointed. When I look at the topics, I dont think I really learned a lot. A lot of what we covered was review. Solow growth was covered in macro. Household surveys Ive covered in a variety of global classes. The gini coefficient I had learned about before. Migration we covered in microeconomics. The potential outcome model and Instrumental Variables we covered in econometrics. The Ricardian model was covered in Microeconomics."
98610,"I learned about the various facets of international development, whether it be labor markets, trade, institutions, or growth. I also learned about numerous case studies and various econometrics models, such as instrumental variables and RDD. I also learned more about coding in Stata and making graphs and tables, as well as conducting independent research."
98610,"This is a terrible course, I learned very little about international development, which was extremely disappointing.

99122,"I learned about the social and environmental factors that may cause someone more likely to experience deficits in executive function and to experience symptoms of antisocial personality and conduct disorder, callous-unemotional traits, and psychopathy. Beyond the clinical aspects of psychopathy, I learned that science and the law do not complement each other because the law does not follow what psychological science tells us. There are certain interventions and treatment that work better than others, each for adults and children, and there are policies that could benefit from change to help these individuals instead of hurt them."
99122,"A general understanding of psychopathy, crime-related behaviors/psychology."

99122,"I really learned a lot about the way the human brain works in general. I learned to appreciate the development differences that can affect people's behavior. In the context of criminal behavior this understanding was especially interesting. The main mental illnesses this class focused on were exteranalizing disorders (Conduct Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder) and Psychopathy, as well as some other related disorders. There was a good blend of both molecular neuroscience information as well as more psychological behavior-related information that was taught in regards to these disordered behaviors. By the end of the class, I feel like I was able to explain certain types of criminal behavior using scientific reasoning very well. This class also provided a strong connection of the science to the legal world as well at the end.

99123,"Understanding of the neuroscience behind drug use (basics of neurotransmission, drugs' mechanism of action, drug effects and metabolic processes) and some information on treatment options and drug laws."
99123,"I learned a lot about the neural mechanisms of drugs, and this has given me a better understanding of the effects they have on people."
99123,"This was such an important course! It taught me so much about the way drugs work in our bodies, and it also provided a framework with which I can analyze drugs beyond the ones we learned about directly in class. ""Drugs"" in the most general sense, including OTC drugs like tylenol, which we interact with all the time. It was really important to learn about drug interactions, and I left with very practical advice like to not take alcohol with tylenol. It also covered historical elements of drugs and sociopolitical implications of certain drug policies. It was a really holistic overview in the best sense of the word, and it was a practical, almost a self-help course. I'll carry this knowledge with me for the rest of my life!"
99123,"Learn about how drugs affect your body through neurotransmission - a lot more ""sciency"" than I thought and I didnt learn too much that was actually helpful/applicable to my own life"
99123,"I learned about the neuro scientific ways drugs work in our brain, however the course was taught in a way that was very hard to follow, the trends between drugs and knowledge from previous lectures was not tied in well at all."

99123,"Drug mechanism of actions, drug effects"
99123,I developed a somewhat nuanced understanding of the basic ideas surrounding the neuropsychology of drugs and addiction. I improved my understanding of the risks and preventative measures that are helpful to know in the realm of drugs in real life.
99123,"I learned about many psychoactive drugs, including how they operate in the brain and how they become addictive. I also learned about drug policy related to many drugs, learned about addiction and addiction treatment, and learned a bit about the neuroscience of mental health.

We started out with a very comprehensive and useful unit on neurotransmission as a foundation for the course, then spent most of the course learning about different drugs and what they do specifically in the brain and body. I now know how to explain to a friend why they shouldn't take Tylenol and alcohol anywhere near each other, and what to watch out for when considering trying ketamine as an antidepressant."

99136,"learning modern philosophy (Descartes, Kant, Hume, Spinoza, etc). How to write a philosophy paper"
99136,A brief understanding of the major ideas of the philosophies of important western philosophers in the modern period
99136,This was my first time taking a philosophy course and I loved it. I really enjoyed learning about these philosophers.
99136,"In the course, I have come close to understanding true ""Chekhovian"" writing, where every word of every sentence needs to be intentionally used. I could clearly see the differences in the tone, precision, and purposefulness of the language of my first and second papers. In the first essay, I would spend a great deal of time trying to find a better-sounding synonym for simple words. In the second, I would rather prefer a simpler, more effective word to an unreasonably vague alternative. Not only has it made my writing more clear and easy and more pleasant to read, but it has also made the writing process a much more fulfilling experience. Because no extravagant synonyms are forcefully put in sentences, I started to enjoy writing in a cut-to-the-point and more intuitive style, which requires much less effort to produce than the former.   It was also interesting to follow how philosophical reasoning has shifted from a theological inquiry to a more human-mind-centered one around the time of the Enlightenment Era. The observation of the evolution of modern philosophy reveals that our perceptions say more about us than just the nature of God or that of the ""external"" world. Comparing Kant's system of categories to that of Aristotle's demonstrates this change. Aristotle's categories focus on the objective properties of substances as individual entities, while Kant's categories relate to the cognitive framework through which we understand the world. Kant's emphasis on the mind's role in shaping our experience signifies a turn toward the centrality of human cognition.  While this comparison concerns two systems developed in starkly different historical contexts, in the discourse of Modern Philosophy, some thinkers were in contact with one another. In the exchange between Conway and Descartes, for instance, subtle differences and underdevelopments in the authors' arguments are revealed, allowing the reader to think about what is important in interpreting philosophical writings. Interestingly, Berkeley's response to Locke's qualities of perceived objects shows the subtle ways in which a philosophical idea can be misunderstood."
99136,How to think in a different way
99136,I learned the history of modern metaphysical thought. I learned to write a philosophy paper and reading metaphysical philosophy.
99136,I learned of various philosophers throughout history. We focused on epistemology and metaphysics.
99136,"This course taught me how to understand and evaluate arguments, aim for a greater degree of precision in my writing and speaking, and consider theories for how the world truly operates. It's excellent in developing key critical thinking skills and useful in application to any area in life."
99136,"I learned general knowledge about the arguments and metaphysical worlds of the early modern philosophers. Additionally, I learned major thematic questions that united various philosophers in their search for understanding. This class focused mainly on metaphysics, though some epistemology appeared at the end. Additionally, I learned through the papers, how to construct compelling and effective philosophical arguments."

99136,Knowledge of philosophy from Descartes to Kant.
99136,"This was my first philosophy class, so I learned how to write a philosophy paper, how to analyze and think critically about philosophical arguments, and how to engage with others in philosophical debates. I learned about the development of Western modern philosophy as it slowly became more secular. My biggest takeaway from this course, though, was that it pushed me to think about the workings of the world in so many new and unexpected ways."
99136,"Some of the positions of early modern philosophers on several key topics and their arguments in support of those positions or against other positions; the relationship between the philosophical systems of these philosophers. Topics included (but were not limited to) perception, skepticism, the mind-body problem, causation, the existence of God, determinism and necessitarianism, freedom of the will, among others.  Note: As other students have said before, this course would be more aptly titled ""Introduction to Early Modern Philosophy."""

99136,I had never taken a philosophy class before so I learned how to write a philosophical paper and learned how to read and understand different philosophers styles of writing.
99136,"As this is primarily a history of philosophy course, I mainly learned about the varying metaphysical theories held by important philosophers of the modern tradition regarding topics such as the mind-body relationship, the existence of God and the physical world, the capabilities of human reason, and more. Beyond this historical education, I also developed skills in argumentation, writing, and critical reading."

99145,"knowledge on different ethical systems, different author's perspectives and arguments for and against these systems"
99145,"Content-wise, I've gained a lot of knowledge about different moral theories and the views of major moral philosophers such as Mill and Kant. Skills-wise, I learned how to evaluate these moral theories and argue for/against them. The grading on the papers is as harsh as everyone says, but by paying attention to the feedback I received, I think I was able to improve a lot in my philosophy writing!"
99145,"Knowledge: basic moral frameworks of utilitarianism, Kantianism, and contractarianism. Skills: how to write a philosophy paper Insights: ethics are dumb"
99145,It made me much better at formulating arguments.
99145,"This course provides a broad overview of ethics. It also teaches best practices for writing philosophical papers. It perhaps deserves a writing credit for that reason; from what I've heard, many courses that offer writing credits actually devote less time to writing than this one did. Conversely, though, the expectations in terms of the quantity of writing that we're to produce are fairly low (a relief for a philosophy course): three five-page papers."
99145,moral philosophy frameworks
99145,"This class is absolutely wonderful. It is structured for you to learn and get better. I learned how to write a strong paper, articulate my arguments verbally, and really understand complex philosophical concepts."
99145,Helped my critical thinking and understanding of ethics and philosophy
99145,"I learned about the ethical theories of utilitarianism and Kantianism. There was also some more limited coverage of Hobbes, moral objectivism/subjectivism, Hume, and metaethics. I also learned how to write philosophy papers better, mainly by just doing it."
99145,"We read Hobbes, Kant, Mills, and more."
99145,"Great introduction to philosophy, especially as someone who has never taken this type of class"
99145,I developed almost nothing. Consistently got the same grades the whole semester.

99145,"As an EPE major, I regret taking this course so late in my Yale career as it would have served as a good foundation for many of my other courses. But, because of this I don't think I gained very much knowledge related to this course."
99145,I learned how to analyze philosophy on my own without guidance nor support. I also learned to accept bad grades with no rhyme or reason and after putting my all into a paper.

I also gained a fairly in-depth knowledge of different moral theories (Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Humeanism, Contractarianism, etc.) through the lens of their originators and through that of the theory in and of itself."
99145,"I had never taken a philosophy course before, so I learned a lot about moral philosophy, as well as how to write philosophy papers."
99145,"The ability to form an ethical and logical argument; learned how to recognize a sound vs. a valid argument; gained a basis in the foundational moral theories such as utilitarianism, contractarianism, and kantianism. The biggest takeaway was definitely the skill of writing an argumentative paper that uses theory to argue for a certain conclusion it was a great exercise in logic and critical thinking."

Through this, the discussion sections and papers trained my philosophical reasoning and argumentation, as well as ability to think critically and analytically."
99145,I learned a great deal of philosophy.
99145,"how to write a philosophy paper well, the basics of different ethical philosophical views, what thinking like a philosopher means"
99145,"I think the biggest skill I learned in this class is how to formulate a philosophical thought in much the same way I would a math problem. Having never taken a philosophy course in the past, the proof-like formula opened my eyes and provided a concrete argument to fall onto and guide my essays. Additionally, when I first heard that 5 pages would be little room for a philosophy essay, I was surprised. Having written 5 page essays last semester, I had never had the issue of too little room. But after having taken the class, and having gone even over 3 pages extra in my essay before cutting down, I am very happy to say that I really did learn to expand my thoughts and work out every little detail."
99145,"I learned how to write a philosophy paper, and I learned the basics of a few moral philosophies."
99145,"abstract thinking, some fundamentals of law and government"
99145,"This class provided a detailed overview of foundational ideas in ethics, focusing on utilitarianism and Kantianism while also exploring free will, the nature of reason, contractarianism, and why we should even care about ethics in the first place. The content was definitely interesting, but the most valuable thing I took away was definitely the analytic mindset it helped me develop. Ethicists think very systematically about arguments, breaking them into premises and then interrogating each one (which often involves breaking them down even further into sub-arguments). Section and the papers give you the ability to try your hand at that style of thinking, which is very valuable; it isnt entirely unlike what you might see in other subjects, but its very rigorous and important to practice."

99383,"I learned about sociological ideas in many different subjects, some of which include sports, education, medicine, crime, and the body. It was really interesting to think about things in a different way than I had before, especially during lectures that lined up with things we've discussed in other classes. It was very much an overview course, so we didn't go very deep into anything, but there were a couple people we talked about across many different fields (Durkheim, Foucault, Weber), and that let me make connections between topics."
99383,"Sociology - study of society and what makes it work. The way the course worked was that each lecture was generally on a broad topic (e.g. sports, education, crime) and the social aspects. Overall I think the course did a good job of giving a sense of how a wide set of things are social, and how the social plays a part of each of these things, though we didn't quite go into depth with any particular topic (though they came up again and again because of interconnections). Overall I think each class was a good exercise in deconstructing different aspects of life and seeing how they're social activities. I think that seeing things through the sociological lens helps in seeing how the social plays a part in different parts of my own life."
